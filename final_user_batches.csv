zhiweny2@illinois.edu,static_1,Collaborative care for people with depression and anxiety,"Common mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety, are estimated to affect up to 15% of the UK population at any one time, and health care systems worldwide need to implement interventions to reduce the impact and burden of these conditions; collaborative care is a complex intervention based on chronic disease management models that may be effective in the management of these common mental health problems. To assess the effectiveness of collaborative care for patients with depression or anxiety, we searched databases to February 2012, including The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group (CCDAN) trials registers (CCDANCTR-References and CCDANCTR-Studies) which include relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from MEDLINE (1950 to present), EMBASE (1974 to present), PsycINFO (1967 to present) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, all years), as well as the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal (ICTRP), ClinicalTrials.gov, and CINAHL (to November 2010 only), and we screened the reference lists of reports of all included studies and published systematic reviews for reports of additional studies. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of collaborative care for participants of all ages with depression or anxiety were included; two independent researchers extracted data using a standardised data extraction sheet, made 'Risk of bias' assessments using criteria from The Cochrane Collaboration, combined continuous measures of outcome using standardised mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), combined dichotomous measures using risk ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs, and conducted sensitivity analyses to test robustness. We included seventy-nine RCTs (including 90 relevant comparisons) involving 24,308 participants in the review, and studies varied in terms of risk of bias. The results of primary analyses demonstrated significantly greater improvement in depression outcomes for adults with depression treated with the collaborative care model in the short-term (SMD -0.34, 95% CI -0.41 to -0.27; RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.43), medium-term (SMD -0.28, 95% CI -0.41 to -0.15; RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.48), and long-term (SMD -0.35, 95% CI -0.46 to -0.24; RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.41); however, these significant benefits were not demonstrated into the very long-term (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.27). The results also demonstrated significantly greater improvement in anxiety outcomes for adults with anxiety treated with the collaborative care model in the short-term (SMD -0.30, 95% CI -0.44 to -0.17; RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.87), medium-term (SMD -0.33, 95% CI -0.47 to -0.19; RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.69), and long-term (SMD -0.20, 95% CI -0.34 to -0.06; RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.42); no comparisons examined the effects of the intervention on anxiety outcomes in the very long-term. There was evidence of benefit in secondary outcomes including medication use, mental health quality of life, and patient satisfaction, although there was less evidence of benefit in physical quality of life. Collaborative care is associated with significant improvement in depression and anxiety outcomes compared with usual care, and represents a useful addition to clinical pathways for adult patients with depression and anxiety.","Many people suffer from depression and anxiety, and these problems can make people feel sad, scared and even suicidal, and can affect their work, their relationships and their quality of life; depression and anxiety can occur because of personal, financial, social or health problems. �Collaborative care� is an innovative way of treating depression and anxiety and involves a number of health professionals working with a patient to help them overcome their problems; it often involves a medical doctor, a case manager (with training in depression and anxiety), and a mental health specialist such as a psychiatrist, with the case manager having regular contact with the person and organising care together with the medical doctor and specialist, and offering help with medication or access to a �talking therapy� to help the patient get better. Collaborative care has been tested with patients in a number of countries and health care systems, but it is not clear whether it should be recommended for people with depression or anxiety. In this review we found 79 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (90 comparisons) including 24,308 patients worldwide, comparing collaborative care with routine care or alternative treatments (such as consultation-liaison) for depression and anxiety; there were problems with the methods in some of the studies, for example, the methods used to allocate patients to collaborative care or routine care were not always free from bias, and many patients did not complete follow-up or provide information about their outcomes. Most of the studies focused on depression and the evidence suggests that collaborative care is better than routine care in improving depression for up to two years; a smaller number of studies examined the effect of collaborative care on anxiety and the evidence suggests that collaborative care is also better than usual care in improving anxiety for up to two years. Collaborative care increases the number of patients using medication in line with current guidance, and can improve mental health related quality of life, and patients with depression and anxiety treated with collaborative care are also more satisfied with their treatment.",1114,"collaborative care, mental health, depression, anxiety, randomised controlled trials (RCTs), standardised mean differences (SMDs), confidence intervals (CIs), risk ratios (RRs), chronic disease management models, Cochrane Collaboration",What was the study trying to examine regarding mental health problems like depression and anxiety?,What method(s) were used to assess the effectiveness of collaborative care in the study?,What results were found regarding the effectiveness of collaborative care on depression and anxiety in the study?
zhiweny2@illinois.edu,static_1,Do physical measures such as hand-washing or wearing masks stop or slow down the spread of respiratory viruses?,"Viral epidemics or pandemics of acute respiratory infections (ARIs) pose a global threat, such as the influenza (H1N1) pandemic in 2009 caused by the H1N1pdm09 virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 in 2019, and antiviral drugs and vaccines may be insufficient to prevent their spread; this is an update of a Cochrane Review last published in 2020 and includes results from studies conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. The objective was to assess the effectiveness of physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of acute respiratory viruses. We searched CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and two trials registers in October 2022, with backward and forward citation analysis. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-RCTs investigating physical interventions (screening at entry ports, isolation, quarantine, physical distancing, personal protection, hand hygiene, face masks, glasses, and gargling) to prevent respiratory virus transmission, and used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We included 11 new RCTs and cluster-RCTs (610,872 participants), bringing the total to 78; six were conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic (two from Mexico, and one each from Denmark, Bangladesh, England, and Norway), and we identified four ongoing studies, one completed but unreported, evaluating masks during COVID-19. Many studies were conducted during non-epidemic influenza periods, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, or influenza seasons up to 2016, meaning many occurred under lower viral circulation compared with COVID-19; settings varied widely, from suburban schools to hospital wards in high-income countries, crowded inner-city areas in low-income countries, and an immigrant neighbourhood in a high-income country, and adherence to interventions was low in many studies, with risk of bias mostly high or unclear. We included 12 trials comparing medical/surgical masks versus no masks (two in healthcare workers and 10 in the community); wearing masks in the community probably makes little or no difference in influenza-like illness/COVID-like illness compared to not wearing masks (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.09; 9 trials, 276,917 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and probably makes little or no difference in laboratory-confirmed influenza/SARS-CoV-2 (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.42; 6 trials, 13,919 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), with harms rarely measured. For N95/P2 respirators compared to medical/surgical masks, pooled trials (four in healthcare settings and one in a household) show very uncertain effects on clinical respiratory illness (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.10; 3 trials, 7779 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and they may be effective for ILI (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.03; 5 trials, 8407 participants; low-certainty evidence); for laboratory-confirmed influenza, N95/P2 respirators probably make little or no difference (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.34; 5 trials, 8407 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Restricting analyses to healthcare workers made no difference; harms were poorly measured, though discomfort was reported. One recently published RCT found medical/surgical masks non-inferior to N95 respirators in 1009 healthcare workers across four countries treating COVID-19 patients. For hand hygiene, 19 trials compared interventions with controls across schools, childcare centres, and homes; hand hygiene resulted in a 14% relative reduction in ARIs (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.90; 9 trials, 52,105 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), reducing cases from 380 to 327 per 1000 people. For ILI (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.09; 11 trials, 34,503 participants; low-certainty evidence) and laboratory-confirmed influenza (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.30; 8 trials, 8332 participants; low-certainty evidence), effects suggested little or no difference. Pooled data from 19 trials (71,210 participants) for ARI/ILI/influenza found hand hygiene may be beneficial with an 11% relative reduction (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.94; low-certainty evidence), though with high heterogeneity; harms were rarely reported. No RCTs were found for gowns and gloves, face shields, or screening at entry ports. The high risk of bias, variation in outcome measurement, and low adherence hinder firm conclusions; additional RCTs during the pandemic existed but were relatively few despite the importance of evaluating masking and adherence, especially in vulnerable groups. There remains uncertainty about the effects of face masks, with low to moderate certainty meaning confidence is limited and true effects may differ; pooled RCTs did not show a clear reduction in respiratory viral infection with medical/surgical masks, and no clear difference was seen between medical/surgical masks and N95/P2 respirators in healthcare workers providing routine care. Hand hygiene is likely to modestly reduce respiratory illness, though not significantly for ILI or laboratory-confirmed influenza. Harms were under-investigated. There is a need for large, well-designed RCTs across multiple settings and populations to evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions and the impact of adherence, especially among those at highest risk of ARIs.","Respiratory viruses are viruses that infect the cells in your airways � nose, throat, and lungs � and these infections can cause serious problems and affect normal breathing, leading to illnesses such as flu (influenza), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and COVID-19. People infected with a respiratory virus spread virus particles into the air when they cough or sneeze, and others become infected if they come into contact with these particles in the air or on surfaces; respiratory viruses can spread quickly through communities, populations, countries (causing epidemics), and around the world (causing pandemics). Physical measures to try to prevent respiratory viruses spreading include washing hands often; not touching your eyes, nose, or mouth; sneezing or coughing into your elbow; wiping surfaces with disinfectant; wearing masks, eye protection, gloves, and gowns; avoiding contact with other people (isolation or quarantine); keeping a distance from others; and screening people entering a country for signs of infection. We wanted to find out whether physical measures stop or slow the spread of respiratory viruses from well-controlled randomised controlled trials comparing one intervention to another. We searched for randomised controlled studies that looked at physical measures to stop people acquiring a respiratory virus infection and were interested in how many people caught a respiratory virus infection and whether the physical measures had unwanted effects. We identified 78 relevant studies conducted in low-, middle-, and high-income countries in hospitals, schools, homes, offices, childcare centres, and communities during non-epidemic influenza periods, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, influenza seasons up to 2016, and during the COVID-19 pandemic; five ongoing, unpublished studies were found, two evaluating masks for COVID-19, with five trials funded by government and pharmaceutical companies, and nine funded by pharmaceutical companies. No studies looked at face shields, gowns and gloves, or screening at borders. We assessed the effects of medical or surgical masks, N95/P2 respirators (close-fitting masks filtering inhaled air, mostly used by healthcare workers), and hand hygiene (hand-washing or hand sanitiser). For medical or surgical masks, ten studies took place in the community and two in healthcare workers; compared with wearing no mask (community studies only), wearing a mask may make little to no difference in how many people caught a flu-like or COVID-like illness (9 studies; 276,917 people), and probably makes little or no difference in how many had flu or COVID confirmed by a lab test (6 studies; 13,919 people), with discomfort rarely reported. For N95/P2 respirators, four studies were in healthcare workers and one small study in the community; compared with wearing surgical masks, N95/P2 respirators probably make little to no difference in confirmed flu (5 studies; 8407 people) and may make little to no difference in flu-like illness (5 studies; 8407 people) or respiratory illness (3 studies; 7799 people), with discomfort mentioned. For hand hygiene, following a hand hygiene programme may reduce respiratory or flu-like illness or confirmed flu compared with no programme (19 studies; 71,210 people), although the reduction was not statistically confirmed when ILI and lab-confirmed ILI were analysed separately; few studies measured unwanted effects, with skin irritation from sanitiser mentioned. Our confidence in these results is generally low to moderate for subjective outcomes such as respiratory illness, but moderate for more precise laboratory-confirmed infection outcomes related to masks and N95/P2 respirators; results may change with more evidence, and adherence to mask-wearing and hand hygiene was relatively low, which may have affected study outcomes.",1111,"acute respiratory infections, randomized controlled trials, physical interventions, face masks, hand hygiene, viral epidemics, N95/P2 respirators, laboratory-confirmed influenza, SARS-CoV-2, adherence",What was the objective of the study?,What methods and procedures did the study employ to gather data?,What were the findings regarding the effectiveness of hand hygiene and face masks in reducing respiratory infections?
zhiweny2@illinois.edu,static_1,Benefits and harms of antibiotics for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease,"Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of mortality worldwide with approximately 7.4 million deaths each year. People with established coronary heart disease have a high risk of subsequent cardiovascular events including myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death. Antibiotics might prevent such outcomes due to their antibacterial, antiinflammatory, and antioxidative effects. However, a randomised clinical trial and several observational studies have suggested that antibiotics may increase the risk of cardiovascular events and mortality. Furthermore, several non-Cochrane Reviews, that are now outdated, have assessed the effects of antibiotics for coronary heart disease and have shown conflicting results. No previous systematic review using Cochrane methodology has assessed the effects of antibiotics for coronary heart disease. We assessed the benefits and harms of antibiotics compared with placebo or no intervention for the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, SCI-EXPANDED, and BIOSIS in December 2019 in order to identify relevant trials. Additionally, we searched TRIP, Google Scholar, and nine trial registries in December 2019. We also contacted 11 pharmaceutical companies and searched the reference lists of included trials, previous systematic reviews, and other types of reviews. Randomised clinical trials assessing the effects of antibiotics versus placebo or no intervention for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease in adult participants (?18 years) were included irrespective of setting, blinding, publication status, publication year, language, and reporting of outcomes. Three review authors independently extracted data. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, serious adverse event according to ICH-GCP, and quality of life. Secondary outcomes were cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, and sudden cardiac death. The primary time point of interest was at maximum follow-up, and data were also extracted at 24�6 months follow-up. Risks of systematic errors were assessed using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool, and risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated. We included 38 trials randomising 26,638 participants (mean age 61.6 years), with 23/38 trials reporting data on 26,078 participants suitable for meta-analysis. Three trials were at low risk of bias and the remaining 35 were at high risk of bias. Trials assessing macrolides (28 trials; 22,059 participants) and quinolones (two trials; 4162 participants) contributed most of the data. Meta-analyses at maximum follow-up showed that antibiotics versus placebo or no intervention seemed to increase the risk of all-cause mortality (RR 1.06; 95% CI 0.99 to 1.13), stroke (RR 1.14; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.29), and probably also cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.11; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.25). Little to no difference was observed for myocardial infarction (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.88 to 1.03) and sudden cardiac death (RR 1.08; 95% CI 0.90 to 1.31). Meta-analyses at 24�6 months follow-up showed that antibiotics increased the risk of all-cause mortality (RR 1.25; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.48), cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.50; 95% CI 1.17 to 1.91), and probably also sudden cardiac death (RR 1.77; 95% CI 1.28 to 2.44). No evidence of a difference was found for myocardial infarction or stroke at this time point. Meta-analyses of trials at low risk of bias differed only for cardiovascular mortality at maximum follow-up; all other outcomes were consistent with overall analyses. None of the trials specifically assessed serious adverse events according to ICH-GCP, and no data were available on quality of life. Current evidence suggests that antibiotics (macrolides or quinolones) for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease appear harmful when assessing all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and stroke at maximum follow-up, as well as all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and sudden cardiac death at 24�6 months follow-up. Therefore, current evidence does not support the clinical use of macrolides or quinolones for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease. Future trials examining the safety of these antibiotics for this purpose do not seem ethical, and antibiotic trials in general require longer follow-up to capture late adverse events.","Coronary heart disease, also known as cardiovascular disease, is the leading cause of death worldwide with approximately 7.4 million deaths each year. Coronary heart disease is caused by decreased blood supply to the heart. The severity of the disease ranges from chest pain during exercise to heart attack. Antibiotics might help patients with coronary heart disease and reduce their risk of heart attacks, strokes, chest pain, revascularisation procedures, and death. However, a randomised clinical trial and several observational studies suggested that antibiotics increased the risk of cardiovascular events and death. The aim of this Cochrane systematic review was to assess the benefits and harms of antibiotics in adult patients with coronary heart disease. We primarily assessed the benefits and harms at maximum follow-up and secondly at 24�6 months follow-up. We searched various scientific databases from their inception to December 2019 and found 38 trials where people with coronary heart disease were randomly allocated to antibiotics versus placebo or no intervention. The 38 trials included 26,638 adults with a mean age of 61.6 years. 23 out of the 38 trials reported data on 26,078 participants that could be analysed. The vast majority of the data was contributed by trials assessing the effects of macrolide antibiotics (28 trials; 22,059 participants) and quinolone antibiotics (two trials; 4162 participants), while insufficient data were contributed by trials assessing the effects of tetracycline antibiotics (eight trials; 417 participants). Three trials were at low risk of bias and the remaining trials were at high risk of bias. Patients receiving antibiotics (macrolide antibiotics or quinolone antibiotics) compared with patients receiving placebo or no intervention seemed at a slightly higher risk of death from all causes, death from a cardiac cause, and having a stroke at maximum follow-up. Moreover, a slightly higher risk was also observed when assessing death from all causes, death from a cardiac cause, and sudden death from a cardiac cause at 24�6 months follow-up. None of the trials sufficiently reported the number of participants with serious adverse events. No data were provided on quality of life. Future trials on the safety of macrolide antibiotics or quinolone antibiotics for the secondary prevention in adult patients with coronary heart disease do not seem ethical.",1045,"Coronary heart disease, antibiotics, secondary prevention, all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, macrolides, quinolones, sudden cardiac death",What was the main objective of the study regarding antibiotics and coronary heart disease?,What methodologies were employed in the study to assess the effects of antibiotics for coronary heart disease?,What were the key findings of the study regarding the effect of antibiotics on all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events?
zhiweny2@illinois.edu,static_1,Glucagon-like peptide analogues for type 2 diabetes,"Glucagon-like peptide analogues are a new class of drugs used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes that mimic the endogenous hormone glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1). GLP-1 is an incretin, a gastrointestinal hormone that is released into the circulation in response to ingested nutrients. GLP-1 regulates glucose levels by stimulating glucose-dependent insulin secretion and biosynthesis, and by suppressing glucagon secretion, delayed gastric emptying and promoting satiety.
To assess the effects of glucagon-like peptide analogues in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Studies were obtained from electronic searches of The Cochrane Library (last search issue 1, 2011), MEDLINE (last search March 2011), EMBASE (last search March 2011), Web of Science (last search March 2011) and databases of ongoing trials.
Studies were included if they were randomised controlled trials of a minimum duration of eight weeks comparing a GLP-1 analogue with placebo, insulin, an oral anti-diabetic agent, or another GLP-1 analogue in people with type 2 diabetes.
Data extraction and quality assessment of studies were done by one reviewer and checked by a second. Data were analysed by type of GLP-1 agonist and comparison treatment. Where appropriate, data were summarised in a meta-analysis (mean differences and risk ratios summarised using a random-effects model).
Seventeen randomised controlled trials including relevant analyses for 6899 participants were included in the analysis. Studies were mostly of short duration, usually 26 weeks. In comparison with placebo, all GLP-1 agonists reduced glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels by about 1%. Exenatide 2 mg once weekly and liraglutide 1.8 mg reduced it by 0.20% and 0.24% respectively more than insulin glargine. Exenatide 2 mg once weekly reduced HbA1c more than exenatide 10 μg twice daily, sitagliptin and pioglitazone. Liraglutide 1.8 mg reduced HbA1c by 0.33% more than exenatide 10 μg twice daily. Liraglutide led to similar improvements in HbA1c compared to sulphonylureas but reduced it more than sitagliptin and rosiglitazone. Both exenatide and liraglutide led to greater weight loss than most active comparators, including in participants not experiencing nausea. Hypoglycaemia occurred more frequently in participants taking concomitant sulphonylurea. GLP-1 agonists caused gastrointestinal adverse effects, mainly nausea. These adverse events were strongest at the beginning and then subsided. Beta-cell function was improved with GLP-1 agonists but the effect did not persist after cessation of treatment. None of the studies was long enough to assess long-term positive or negative effects.
GLP-1 agonists are effective in improving glycaemic control.","Glucagon-like peptide analogues or agonists are a new kind of drug in the treatment of type 2 diabetes that are given by injection under the skin. They regulate glucose levels by stimulating glucose-dependent insulin secretion and biosynthesis, and by suppressing glucagon secretion, delaying gastric emptying and promoting satiety.  Various glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists are in use or in the licensing process, including exenatide, liraglutide, albiglutide, taspoglutide, lixisenatide and LY2189265.
Seventeen randomised controlled trials of mostly moderate to high quality randomised approximately 6899 people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Studies were mostly of short duration, usually 26 weeks. The longest duration study was 30 weeks. Of the seventeen studies, one compared albiglutide with placebo, two compared exenatide 10 µg twice daily against exenatide 2 mg once weekly, one compared exenatide 2 mg once weekly against insulin glargine, one compared exenatide 2 mg once weekly against pioglitazone and sitagliptin, five compared liraglutide with placebo, two compared liraglutide with sulphonylurea, one each compared exenatide twice daily with liraglutide, liraglutide with sitagliptin, liraglutide with rosiglitazone and liraglutide with insulin glargine, two compared taspoglutide with placebo and one each compared lixisenatide with placebo and LY2189265 with placebo. In people already treated with oral anti-diabetes drugs, addition of glucagon-like peptide analogues improved blood sugar control in comparison to placebo, rosiglitazone, pioglitazone or sitagliptin, but not always in comparison to insulin (for exenatide) or glimepiride (a sulphonylurea). Glucagon-like peptide analogous caused more weight loss than any of the comparison treatments. However, more nausea and other gastrointestinal effects such as diarrhoea or vomiting were seen, though these tended to wear off and were not seen in all participants. There was slightly more hypoglycaemia with glucagon-like analogous than with placebo, but generally less than with other anti-diabetic treatments. The incidence of hypoglycaemia occurred more frequently in participants taking concomitant sulphonylurea. The studies were not long enough to assess long-term side effects. None of the studies investigated mortality or morbidity.",1006,"Glucagon-like peptide analogues, GLP-1, HbA1c, exenatide, liraglutide, incretin, insulin secretion, glycaemic control, beta-cell function, hypoglycaemia",What was the primary aim of the study regarding glucagon-like peptide analogues?,What methods were employed for data collection and analysis in this research?,What were the significant findings related to HbA1c levels and weight loss from the study?
zhiweny2@illinois.edu,static_2,How accurate are alternative laboratory-based molecular tests (to RT-PCR with prior RNA extraction/purification) for identifying people infected by SARS-CoV-2?,"Diagnosing people with a SARS-CoV-2 infection played a critical role in managing the COVID-19 pandemic and remains a priority for the transition to long-term management of COVID-19. Initial shortages of extraction and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) reagents impaired the desired upscaling of testing in many countries, which led to the search for alternatives to RNA extraction/purification and RT-PCR testing. Reference standard methods for diagnosing the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection rely primarily on real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Alternatives to RT-PCR could, if sufficiently accurate, have a positive impact by expanding the range of diagnostic tools available for the timely identification of people infected by SARS-CoV-2, access to testing and the use of resources. We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of alternative (to RT-PCR assays) laboratory-based molecular tests for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection. We searched the COVID-19 Open Access Project living evidence database from the University of Bern until 30 September 2020 and the WHO COVID-19 Research Database until 31 October 2022, with no language restrictions. We included studies of people with suspected or known SARS-CoV-2 infection, or where tests were used to screen for infection, and studies evaluating commercially developed laboratory-based molecular tests for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection considered as alternatives to RT-PCR testing, and we included all reference standards to define the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2, including RT-PCR tests and established clinical diagnostic criteria. Two authors independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and applicability using the QUADAS-2 tool. We presented sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals for each test using paired forest plots and summarised results using average sensitivity and specificity with a bivariate random-effects meta-analysis, illustrating the findings per index test category and assay brand compared to the WHO�s acceptable sensitivity and specificity thresholds for nucleic acid tests. We included data from 64 studies reporting 94 cohorts of participants and 105 index test evaluations, with 74,753 samples and 7517 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases. We did not identify any published or preprint reports of accuracy for a considerable number of commercially produced NAAT assays. Most cohorts were judged at unclear or high risk of bias in more than three QUADAS-2 domains; around half were at high risk of selection bias because of recruitment based on COVID status; and three quarters were at high risk of bias in the reference standard domain due to reliance on a single RT-PCR result or unclear diagnostic timing, missing results, or absent participant flow diagrams. For test categories with four or more evaluations allowing summary estimates, RT-PCR assays designed to omit/adapt RNA extraction/purification had average sensitivity of 95.1% (95% CI 91.1% to 97.3%) and specificity of 99.7% (95% CI 98.5% to 99.9%; 27 evaluations, 2834 samples and 1178 cases); RT-LAMP assays had average sensitivity of 88.4% (95% CI 83.1% to 92.2%) and specificity of 99.7% (95% CI 98.7% to 99.9%; 24 evaluations, 29,496 samples and 2255 cases); TMA assays had average sensitivity of 97.6% (95% CI 95.2% to 98.8%) and specificity of 99.4% (95% CI 94.9% to 99.9%; 14 evaluations, 2196 samples and 942 cases); digital PCR assays had average sensitivity of 98.5% (95% CI 95.2% to 99.5%) and specificity of 91.4% (95% CI 60.4% to 98.7%; 5 evaluations, 703 samples and 354 cases); RT-LAMP assays omitting/adapting RNA extraction had average sensitivity of 73.1% (95% CI 58.4% to 84%) and specificity of 100% (95% CI 98% to 100%; 24 evaluations, 14,342 samples and 1502 cases). Only two index categories fulfilled WHO-acceptable requirements: RT-PCR assays designed to omit/adapt RNA extraction/purification and TMA assays. At 5% prevalence in a cohort of 1000 people, the positive predictive value of RT-PCR assays omitting/adapting extraction is 94%, with three false positives among 51 positive results and about two missed cases; for TMA assays, positive predictive value is 89%, with six false positives among 55 positive results and around one missed case. Alternative laboratory-based molecular tests aim to enhance testing capacity by reducing time, steps, and resource requirements. Several technologies with potential advantages have not been evaluated or were assessed by few low-quality studies, so performance remains undetermined. Only RT-PCR assays designed to omit/adapt RNA extraction/purification and TMA assays fulfil WHO accuracy standards and may be suitable alternatives when RT-PCR is inaccessible. However, findings must be interpreted with caution due to limitations, including reliance on retrospective samples without symptom information, dominant representation of specific high-performing brands (21/26 and 12/14 studies), and methodological weaknesses. Although we used comprehensive searches and broad inclusion criteria, further research is needed to evaluate alternative COVID-19 tests and their role in pandemic management.","Laboratory-based molecular assays (tests) aim to confirm or rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection in people. Alternatives to RT-PCR assays have been developed to minimise the steps needed to process samples in the laboratory or use fewer resources to obtain the same valid results. For this review, we focus on tests commercially developed by a manufacturer, providing instructions for their professional use. People with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection should know if they are infected to self-isolate, receive treatment, and inform close contacts. Failure to detect SARS-CoV-2 when it is present risks spreading infection and results in missed opportunities for prevention. Diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection when it is not present may lead to unnecessary self-isolation and testing of close contacts. Currently, testing to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection relies on a laboratory molecular test called RT-PCR. This requires specialist equipment and can take 24 hours to produce a result. If assays that take less time or use readily available resources were sufficiently accurate to replace RT-PCR testing, this could increase the number of tests that could be done, allow faster diagnosis and enable people to take appropriate action more quickly. We wanted to know whether commercially developed, alternative laboratory-based molecular tests are accurate enough to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to RT-PCR. We looked for studies investigating these tests in people (or samples) that were also tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection using RT-PCR which modified RT-PCR by removing or altering components of this testing process. We included 105 evaluations evaluating alternatives to RT-PCR in the review. The main results are based on 74,753 samples, and SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed in 7517 of these samples. Most evaluations (27/105) concerned various test types specifically designed to omit/adapt RNA extraction/purification. Twenty-four of 105 evaluations concerned various test types operating at one temperature (isothermal tests) rather than cycling through different temperatures. Twenty-four of 105 evaluations were concerned with various test types that combined these two alternative approaches. Only tests specifically designed to omit/adapt RNA extraction/purification and TMA assays with RNA extraction (a type of isothermal test) met WHO-acceptable standards for confirming and ruling out SARS-CoV-2. For illustration, the results of these studies indicate that in a group of 1000 people, 50 of whom (5%) actually have SARS-CoV-2: for tests specifically designed to omit/adapt RNA extraction/purification, 51 people would test positive for SARS-CoV-2, of these, three people (6%) would not have SARS-CoV-2 (false-positive result), and 949 people would test negative for SARS-CoV-2, of these, two people (0.2%) would actually have SARS-CoV-2 (false-negative result); for TMA tests with RNA extraction, 55 people would test positive for SARS-CoV-2, of these, six people (10%) would not have SARS-CoV-2 (false-positive result), and 945 people would test negative for SARS-CoV-2, of these, one person (0.1%) would actually have SARS-CoV-2 (false-negative result). Most included studies did not provide information on participants who underwent testing, such as whether they had symptoms or were close contacts of a SARS-CoV-2 case. We also had concerns about the method of recruiting participants for the majority of included studies, which may have resulted in an overestimation of the accuracy of these methods. In addition, the method used to determine whether individuals did not have SARS-CoV-2 infection was not considered reliable for most studies, which may have resulted in underestimating the accuracy of these methods. Some studies did not follow the manufacturers' instructions for using the test. Results from different test brands using the same technique varied. The studies included in this review suggest that two laboratory-based molecular tests might be accurate enough to replace or supplement RT-PCR tests with prior RNA extraction/purification for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection: RT-PCR tests developed to omit or adapt RNA extraction or purification and TMA isothermal tests (retaining an RNA extraction step). Other alternative tests to RT-PCR were assessed just by a few studies of limited methodological quality, and their performance should be evaluated by additional studies. Furthermore, data in these studies mostly relied on samples acquired in the past (compared to current or future samples), thus further evaluation of these tests in real clinical practice scenarios is required. Also, decisions on the optimal test for a specific setting will be driven not only by diagnostic accuracy, but also by other factors such as test complexity, time to result, acceptability to those being tested, and the setting in which the tests are to be used.",1112,"SARS-CoV-2 infection, RT-PCR, RNA extraction/purification, diagnostic accuracy, TMA assays, molecular tests, specificity, sensitivity, RT-LAMP assays, QUADAS-2 tool",What was the study trying to examine regarding alternative laboratory-based molecular tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection?,What methods were used in the study to assess diagnostic accuracy of alternative molecular tests for SARS-CoV-2?,What were the results regarding the sensitivity and specificity of different test categories found in the study?
zhiweny2@illinois.edu,static_2,Heart surgery for aortic valve replacement through a small incision versus the standard full incision at the front of the chest,"Aortic valve disease is a common condition easily treatable with cardiac surgery. This is conventionally performed by opening the sternum ('median sternotomy') and replacing the valve under cardiopulmonary bypass. Median sternotomy is well tolerated, but as less invasive options become available, the efficacy of limited incisions has been called into question. In particular, the effects of reducing the visibility and surgical access have raised safety concerns with regard to the placement of cannulae, venting of the heart, epicardial wire placement, and de-airing of the heart at the end of the procedure. These difficulties may increase operating times, affecting outcome. The benefits of smaller incisions are thought to include decreased pain; improved respiratory mechanics; reductions in wound infections, bleeding, and need for transfusion; shorter intensive care stay; better cosmesis; and a quicker return to normal activity. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2017, with seven new studies.
To assess the effects of minimally invasive aortic valve replacement via a limited sternotomy versus conventional aortic valve replacement via median sternotomy in people with aortic valve disease requiring surgical replacement.
We performed searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase from inception to August 2021, with no language limitations. We also searched two clinical trials registries and manufacturers' websites. We reviewed references of primary studies to identify any further studies of relevance.
We included randomised controlled trials comparing aortic valve replacement via a median sternotomy versus aortic valve replacement via a limited sternotomy. We excluded trials that performed other minimally invasive incisions such as mini-thoracotomies, port access, transapical, transfemoral or robotic procedures. Although some well-conducted prospective and retrospective case-control and cohort studies exist, these were not included in this review.
Two review authors independently assessed trial papers to extract data, assess quality, and identify risk of bias. A third review author provided arbitration where required. We determined the certainty of evidence using the GRADE methodology and summarised results of patient-relevant outcomes in a summary of findings table.
The review included 14 trials with 1395 participants. Most studies had at least two domains at high risk of bias. We analysed 14 outcomes investigating the effects of minimally invasive limited upper hemi-sternotomy on aortic valve replacement as compared to surgery performed via full median sternotomy. Upper hemi-sternotomy may have little to no effect on mortality versus full median sternotomy (risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45 to 1.94; 10 studies, 985 participants; low-certainty evidence). Upper hemi-sternotomy for aortic valve replacement may increase cardiopulmonary bypass time slightly, although the evidence is very uncertain (mean difference (MD) 10.63 minutes, 95% CI 3.39 to 17.88; 10 studies, 1043 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and may increase aortic cross-clamp time slightly (MD 6.07 minutes, 95% CI 0.79 to 11.35; 12 studies, 1235 participants; very low-certainty evidence), although the evidence is very uncertain. Most studies had at least two domains at high risk of bias. Postoperative blood loss was probably lower in the upper hemi-sternotomy group (MD -153 mL, 95% CI -246 to -60; 8 studies, 767 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Low-certainty evidence suggested that there may be no change in pain scores by upper hemi-sternotomy (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.19, 95% CI -0.43 to 0.04; 5 studies, 649 participants). Upper hemi-sternotomy may result in little to no difference in quality of life (MD 0.03 higher, 95% CI 0 to 0.06 higher; 4 studies, 624 participants; low-certainty evidence). Two studies reporting index admission costs concluded that limited sternotomy may be more costly at index admission in the UK National Health Service (MD 1190 GBP more, 95% CI 420 GBP to 1970 GBP, 2 studies, 492 participants; low-certainty evidence).
The evidence was of very low to moderate certainty. Sample sizes were small and underpowered to demonstrate differences in some outcomes. Clinical heterogeneity was also noted. Considering these limitations, there may be little to no effect on mortality. Differences in extracorporeal support times are uncertain, comparing upper hemi-sternotomy to full sternotomy for aortic valve replacement. Before widespread adoption of the minimally invasive approach can be recommended, there is a need for a well-designed and adequately powered prospective randomised controlled trial. Such a study would benefit from also performing a robust cost analysis. Growing patient preference for minimally invasive techniques merits thorough quality of life analyses to be included as end points, as well as quantitative measures of physiological reserve.","Aortic valve replacement is a common operation performed to replace one of the valves of the heart. The reasons for needing this include valves that do not open properly or do not close properly, which can happen with ageing. People with aortic valve disease can experience chest pain, breathlessness, collapse or sudden death.
The most common way of performing the operation is by opening the whole length of the breastbone. Another method involves a smaller 'keyhole'-type cut that only divides a small part of the breastbone. Doing it this way makes the scar smaller, but can also make the operation more challenging because it is more difficult to see and reach the heart. This might make the operation longer and less safe, even though it looks smaller from the outside.
We wanted to find out if the smaller 'keyhole'-type cut (limited sternotomy) was better than the usual full cut down the breastbone (full sternotomy) when performing aortic valve replacement surgery in adults. We wanted to see if both were as safe and effective as each other.
We updated a review that we had previously written on the topic. We searched for studies that compared limited sternotomy with full sternotomy in adults undergoing aortic valve replacement. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as the study methods and sizes.
We found 14 studies with 1395 participants from Europe, Russia, and North Africa. There was a mixture of different conditions needing aortic valve replacement. Most of these people were 60 to 70 years old and approximately half were male. The participants in each group were similar.
There may be no difference between the groups in the number of people who died as a result of having surgery. If 25 out of every 1000 people who had the full-size cut in their breastbone died after the operation, around 23 (somewhere between 11 and 48) in every 1000 would die using the 'keyhole' operation. Because that range goes from two times less to two times more, it is difficult to say whether the operation is definitely better or worse.
The amount of time that surgeons needed to use a heart-lung machine to support the heart while doing the 'keyhole' operation may have been on average around 11 minutes longer – not a large amount. The amount of time that the heart was completely stopped to do the 'keyhole' operation may be six minutes longer on average, though we were not confident in the evidence.
None of the important problems that occur after heart surgery were more common in either group (infections around the heart, irregular heart rhythms or the need for an urgent reoperation because of bleeding), although again it was uncertain if the evidence was robust enough. Participants probably bled slightly less after having minimally invasive surgery. In the operation with the smaller cut, the average blood loss was 153 mL less. There may be no change in pain and quality of life may not have been any different between the two groups.
Limited sternotomy possibly costs more per operation to perform, by about 1190 pounds sterling.
We were not very confident in the evidence. One of the main problems with the studies was that they were small and may not have picked up subtle differences between the groups. Because problems after heart surgery are rare, we need to assess lots of people having operations in order to spot small changes. Another problem is that surgeons tend to have lots of slightly different ways in which they do operations. There were also differences in practice, meaning that measurements might not have been taken at the same time, in the same way. We need to be careful about making conclusions about which differences in the groups in this review were due to the smaller incision and which were due to these other factors.

zhiweny2@illinois.edu,static_2,Is molnupiravir (an antiviral medicine) safe and effective in treating people with COVID-19?,"To assess the effects of molnupiravir in people with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and mild to moderate symptoms. We identified all relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) by searching the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, Science Citation Index Expanded, the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Literature on Coronavirus Disease database, and the COVID Network Meta-Analysis database with no language restrictions up to 26 April 2024. In outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19, molnupiravir 800 mg taken orally every 12 hours for five days probably results in little to no difference in all-cause mortality and may result in little to no difference in rates of hospitalisation and symptom resolution. There is evidence of increased viral clearance by day 5, but the clinical relevance of this finding is unclear. There is probably little to no difference in adverse events, and there is little to no difference in serious adverse events, with molnupiravir versus placebo or standard care. Inpatient data are lacking, and there is no evidence of benefit of molnupiravir in this population. Further research involving inpatients may change this.","Molnupiravir is a pill used to treat COVID-19 in people who are at high risk of developing severe illness. It works by interfering with the ability of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) to reproduce, helping the body to fight off the infection. We wanted to find out how molnupiravir compares to no treatment, placebo (dummy treatment), or standard of care in decreasing death and hospitalisation in people with COVID-19; speeding up recovery (time to symptom resolution); clearing the virus that causes COVID-19 (viral clearance); safety, by looking at all unwanted events and serious unwanted events. We searched for studies that evaluated molnupiravir compared with no treatment, placebo, or standard of care in people with confirmed COVID-19. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods. The types of studies we looked at were randomised controlled trials, which assign people randomly to two or more treatment groups. This is the best way to ensure that study groups are similar, and that investigators and participants don't know who is in which group. The review included 11 studies with 31,272 participants, mostly outpatients (people not admitted to hospital) with mild to moderate COVID-19. When we combined results from studies that recruited outpatients (people not admitted to hospital) with mild to moderate COVID-19, we found the following key results: Molnupiravir probably results in little to no difference in the risk of death. Compared with people receiving placebo or standard of care, between four and 10 fewer people receiving molnupiravir will die within one month for every 10,000 people treated. We considered this reduction clinically insignificant. Molnupiravir may not reduce hospitalisations, meaning it may not prevent people from getting sicker or needing hospital care. There was evidence of increased viral clearance with molnupiravir by day 5, but this effect diminished by day 14, and we are not sure if it makes any real difference for patients. Molnupiravir may have little to no effect on the probability of having no symptoms by day 14 or day 28. Molnupiravir probably results in little to no difference in adverse events, and results in little to no difference in serious adverse events. There are too few data to draw clear conclusions about molnupiravir's effects in people admitted to hospital with severe COVID-19. Most evidence comes from studies conducted in outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19, so the results may not apply to people with severe illness who are hospitalised. The studies provided scarce evidence on long-term outcomes such as quality of life after recovery or how long the virus stays in the body. We were unable to analyse whether molnupiravir had a different effect in certain groups of people, like those with severe pre-existing conditions or people from low- or middle-income countries.",1106,"Molnupiravir, SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, randomised controlled trials (RCTs), outpatients, viral clearance, all-cause mortality, hospitalisation, symptom resolution, adverse events",What was the study trying to examine regarding molnupiravir?,What methods were used in the study to identify relevant randomized controlled trials?,What results were found regarding molnupiravir's effect on all-cause mortality and hospitalisation in outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19?
zhiweny2@illinois.edu,static_2,Antidepressants for prevention of winter depression,"Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a seasonal pattern of recurrent major depressive episodes that most commonly occurs during autumn or winter and remits in spring. The prevalence of SAD ranges from 1.5% to 9%, depending on latitude. The predictable seasonal aspect of SAD provides a promising opportunity for prevention. This review - one of four reviews on efficacy and safety of interventions to prevent SAD - focuses on second-generation antidepressants (SGAs). To assess the efficacy and safety of SGAs (in comparison with other SGAs, placebo, light therapy, melatonin or agomelatine, psychological therapies or lifestyle interventions) in preventing SAD and improving patient-centred outcomes among adults with a history of SAD. We searched Ovid MEDLINE (1950- ), Embase (1974- ), PsycINFO (1967- ) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to 19 June 2018. An earlier search of these databases was conducted via the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trial Register (CCMD-CTR) (all years to 11 August 2015). Furthermore, we searched the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database and international trial registers (to 19 June 2018). We also conducted a grey literature search and handsearched the reference lists of included studies and pertinent review articles. For efficacy, we included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on adults with a history of winter-type SAD who were free of symptoms at the beginning of the study. For adverse events, we planned to include non-randomised studies. Eligible studies compared a SGA versus another SGA, placebo, light therapy, psychological therapy, melatonin, agomelatine or lifestyle changes. We also intended to compare SGAs in combination with any of the comparator interventions versus placebo or the same comparator intervention as monotherapy. Two review authors independently screened abstracts and full-text publications, extracted data and assessed risk of bias of included studies. When data were sufficient, we conducted random-effects (Mantel-Haenszel) meta-analyses. We assessed statistical heterogeneity by calculating the Chi2 statistic and the Cochran Q. We used the I2 statistic to estimate the magnitude of heterogeneity. We assessed publication bias by using funnel plots. We rated the strength of the evidence using the system developed by the GRADE Working Group. We identified 3745 citations after de-duplication of search results and excluded 3619 records during title and abstract reviews. We assessed 126 full-text papers for inclusion in the review, of which four publications (on three RCTs) providing data from 1100 people met eligibility criteria for this review. All three RCTs had methodological limitations due to high attrition rates. Overall, moderate-quality evidence indicates that bupropion XL is an efficacious intervention for prevention of recurrence of depressive episodes in people with a history of SAD (risk ratio (RR) 0.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 0.72; 3 RCTs, 1100 participants). However, bupropion XL leads to greater risk of headaches (moderate-quality evidence), insomnia and nausea (both low-quality evidence) when compared with placebo. Numbers needed to treat for additional beneficial outcomes (NNTBs) vary by baseline risks. For a population with a yearly recurrence rate of 30%, the NNTB is 8 (95% CI 6 to 12). For populations with yearly recurrence rates of 50% and 60%, NNTBs are 5 (95% CI 4 to 7) and 4 (95% CI 3 to 6), respectively. We could find no studies on other SGAs and no studies comparing SGAs with other interventions of interest, such as light therapy, psychological therapies, melatonin or agomelatine. Available evidence indicates that bupropion XL is an effective intervention for prevention of recurrence of SAD. Nevertheless, even in a high-risk population, three out of four people will not benefit from preventive treatment with bupropion XL and will be at risk for harm. Clinicians need to discuss with patients advantages and disadvantages of preventive SGA treatment, and might want to consider offering other potentially efficacious interventions, which might confer a lower risk of adverse events. Given the lack of comparative evidence, the decision for or against initiating preventive treatment of SAD and the treatment selected should be strongly based on patient preferences. Future researchers need to assess the effectiveness and risk of harms of SGAs other than bupropion for prevention of SAD. Investigators also need to compare benefits and harms of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions.","Why is this review important? Many people in northern latitudes suffer from winter blues, which occurs as a reaction to reduced sunlight. Three-quarters of those affected are women. Lethargy, overeating, craving for carbohydrates and depressed mood are common symptoms. In some people, winter blues becomes depression, which seriously affects their daily lives. Up to two-thirds experience depressive symptoms every winter. Who will be interested in this review? � Anyone who has experienced winter depression. � Relatives and friends of people who have experienced winter depression. � General practitioners, psychiatrists and pharmacists. � Professionals working in adult mental health services. What questions does this review aim to answer? In light of the seasonal pattern and the high rate of recurrence, beginning antidepressant therapy in early autumn (fall) when people are still free of depressive symptoms can prevent the onset of depressed mood. The goal of this review is to examine whether benefits outweigh harms of antidepressants when they are used in healthy people with a history of winter depression to prevent onset of depression the next winter. To date, this question has not been examined in a systematic way. Which studies were included in the review? We searched databases up to June 2018 for studies on antidepressants given to prevent winter depression. Of 3745 records, we found three randomised controlled studies including 1100 people who received bupropion extended-release (only one of many available antidepressants, but the only one licensed for prevention of winter depression) or placebo. We found no studies on other antidepressants. What does evidence from the review reveal? In populations with a high risk of developing a new depressive episode in the next winter, results show that antidepressants can prevent winter depression in about one in four people. In populations with a lower risk of recurrence, antidepressants can prevent a new depressive episode in one of eight people. The other seven people suffer from winter depression despite treatment or would not have suffered from winter depression anyway. People using antidepressants are at slightly higher risk of experiencing headaches, nausea or insomnia when compared with people not taking antidepressants. Doctors need to discuss with patients the advantages and disadvantages of antidepressants and other potentially preventive treatments for winter depression, such as light treatment, psychological therapies or lifestyle interventions. As no available studies have compared these treatments, the decision for or against preventive treatment of SAD and the treatment selected should be strongly based on patient preferences. What should happen next? Review authors recommend that future studies should directly compare antidepressants against other treatments, such as light therapy, psychological therapies or other drugs to determine the best treatment for preventing winter depression.",1120,"Seasonal affective disorder, second-generation antidepressants, randomised controlled trials, bupropion XL, depressive episodes, NNTB (number needed to treat for additional beneficial outcomes), risk ratio, confidence interval, meta-analyses, placebo.",What was the study trying to examine in relation to second-generation antidepressants and seasonal affective disorder?,What methods were used in the study to assess the efficacy and safety of second-generation antidepressants?,What were the results found in the study regarding the effectiveness of bupropion XL for preventing seasonal affective disorder recurrence?
zhiweny2@illinois.edu,interactive_3,Electrical shocks (electrical cardioversion) and drugs (pharmacological cardioversion) for restoring normal rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most frequent sustained arrhythmia. Cardioversion is a rhythm control strategy to restore normal/sinus rhythm, and can be achieved through drugs (pharmacological) or a synchronised electric shock (electrical cardioversion).
To assess the efficacy and safety of pharmacological and electrical cardioversion for atrial fibrillation (AF), atrial flutter and atrial tachycardias.
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science (CPCI-S) and three trials registers (ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP and ISRCTN) on 14 February 2023.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) at the individual patient level. Patient populations were aged ≥ 18 years with AF of any type and duration, atrial flutter or other sustained related atrial arrhythmias, not occurring as a result of reversible causes.
We used standard Cochrane methodology to collect data and performed a network meta-analysis using the standard frequentist graph-theoretical approach using the netmeta package in R. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence which we presented in our summary of findings with a judgement on certainty. We calculated differences using risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) as well as ranking treatments using a P value. We assessed clinical and statistical heterogeneity and split the networks for the primary outcome and acute procedural success, due to concerns about violating the transitivity assumption.
We included 112 RCTs (139 records), from which we pooled data from 15,968 patients. The average age ranged from 47 to 72 years and the proportion of male patients ranged from 38% to 92%. Seventy-nine trials were considered to be at high risk of bias for at least one domain, 32 had no high risk of bias domains, but had at least one domain classified as uncertain risk, and one study was considered at low risk for all domains. For paroxysmal AF (35 trials), when compared to placebo, anteroapical (AA)/anteroposterior (AP) biphasic truncated exponential waveform (BTE) cardioversion (RR: 2.42; 95% CI 1.65 to 3.56), quinidine (RR: 2.23; 95% CI 1.49 to 3.34), ibutilide (RR: 2.00; 95% CI 1.28 to 3.12), propafenone (RR: 1.98; 95% CI 1.67 to 2.34), amiodarone (RR: 1.69; 95% CI 1.42 to 2.02), sotalol (RR: 1.58; 95% CI 1.08 to 2.31) and procainamide (RR: 1.49; 95% CI 1.13 to 1.97) likely result in a large increase in maintenance of sinus rhythm until hospital discharge or end of study follow-up (certainty of evidence: moderate). The effect size was larger for AA/AP incremental and was progressively smaller for the subsequent interventions. Despite low certainty of evidence, antazoline may result in a large increase (RR: 28.60; 95% CI 1.77 to 461.30) in this outcome. Similarly, low-certainty evidence suggests a large increase in this outcome for flecainide (RR: 2.17; 95% CI 1.68 to 2.79), vernakalant (RR: 2.13; 95% CI 1.52 to 2.99), and magnesium (RR: 1.73; 95% CI 0.79 to 3.79). For persistent AF (26 trials), one network was created for electrical cardioversion and showed that, when compared to AP BTE incremental energy with patches, AP BTE maximum energy with patches (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.55) likely results in a large increase, and active compression AP BTE incremental energy with patches (RR: 1.14, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.131) likely results in an increase in maintenance of sinus rhythm at hospital discharge or end of study follow-up (certainty of evidence: high). Use of AP BTE incremental with paddles (RR: 1.03, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.09; certainty of evidence: low) may lead to a slight increase, and AP MDS Incremental paddles (RR: 0.95, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.05; certainty of evidence: low) may lead to a slight decrease in efficacy. On the other hand, AP MDS incremental energy using patches (RR: 0.78, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.87), AA RBW incremental energy with patches (RR: 0.76, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.88), AP RBW incremental energy with patches (RR: 0.76, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.86), AA MDS incremental energy with patches (RR: 0.76, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.86) and AA MDS incremental energy with paddles (RR: 0.68, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.83) probably result in a decrease in this outcome when compared to AP BTE incremental energy with patches (certainty of evidence: moderate). The network for pharmacological cardioversion showed that bepridil (RR: 2.29, 95% CI 1.26 to 4.17) and quindine (RR: 1.53, (95% CI 1.01 to 2.32) probably result in a large increase in maintenance of sinus rhythm at hospital discharge or end of study follow-up when compared to amiodarone (certainty of evidence: moderate). Dofetilide (RR: 0.79, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.44), sotalol (RR: 0.89, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.18), propafenone (RR: 0.79, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.25) and pilsicainide (RR: 0.39, 95% CI 0.02 to 7.01) may result in a reduction in this outcome when compared to amiodarone, but the certainty of evidence is low. For atrial flutter (14 trials), a network could be created only for antiarrhythmic drugs. Using placebo as the common comparator, ibutilide (RR: 21.45, 95% CI 4.41 to 104.37), propafenone (RR: 7.15, 95% CI 1.27 to 40.10), dofetilide (RR: 6.43, 95% CI 1.38 to 29.91), and sotalol (RR: 6.39, 95% CI 1.03 to 39.78) probably result in a large increase in the maintenance of sinus rhythm at hospital discharge or end of study follow-up (certainty of evidence: moderate), and procainamide (RR: 4.29, 95% CI 0.63 to 29.03), flecainide (RR 3.57, 95% CI 0.24 to 52.30) and vernakalant (RR: 1.18, 95% CI 0.05 to 27.37) may result in a large increase in maintenance of sinus rhythm at hospital discharge or end of study follow-up (certainty of evidence: low). All tested electrical cardioversion strategies for atrial flutter had very high efficacy (97.9% to 100%). The rate of mortality (14 deaths) and stroke or systemic embolism (3 events) at 30 days was extremely low. Data on quality of life were scarce and of uncertain clinical significance. No information was available regarding heart failure readmissions. Data on duration of hospitalisation was scarce, of low quality, and could not be pooled.
Despite the low quality of evidence, this systematic review provides important information on electrical and pharmacological strategies to help patients and physicians deal with AF and atrial flutter. In the assessment of the patient comorbidity profile, antiarrhythmic drug onset of action and side effect profile versus the need for a physician with experience in sedation, or anaesthetics support for electrical cardioversion are key aspects when choosing the cardioversion method.","AF is the most frequent abnormal heart rhythm seen in the world. Patients with this condition may feel their heart beating rapidly and irregularly. This can occur for separate brief or long episodes (paroxysmal AF) or it may become continuous (persistent AF). Atrial flutter is a similar abnormal rhythm that causes similar symptoms, can cause episodes of variable duration and can also become continuous.
Cardioversion is a treatment to restore the rhythm of the heart back to normal (sinus rhythm).
We wanted to know if delivering a controlled electrical shock (i.e. electrical cardioversion) and drugs (i.e. pharmacological cardioversion) are effective and safe when restoring heart rhythm back to normal.
We searched for studies that investigated electrical and pharmacological cardioversion compared to each other or placebo (a medicine that looks like the real medicine but that has no active ingredient).
We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our trust in these results, based on factors such as study methods and size.
We found 112 studies. We were able to combine and analyse the results from 72 studies, with 15,968 participants aged between 47 and 72 years. Thirty-five studies included patients with paroxysmal AF (AF that terminates spontaneously or with intervention within 7 days of onset), 26 studies of patients with persistent AF (AF that is continuously sustained beyond seven days, including episodes terminated by cardioversion after ≥ 7 days), and 14 trials included patients with atrial flutter. The remaining included a mix of paroxysmal, persistent AF and atrial flutter.
For patients with paroxysmal AF, electrical cardioversion with biphasic incremental energy, fast-acting drugs like intravenous vernakalant, flecainide, ibutilide and antazoline, and slower-acting and/or oral drugs such as quinidine, propafenone, amiodarone and sotalol are effective at restoring sinus rhythm.
For patients with persistent AF, electrical cardioversion with biphasic energy seems to be the most effective option; bepridil, quinidine and amiodarone tablets may also be effective in selected cases.
For patients with atrial flutter, electrical cardioversion followed by dofetilide are the most effective options.
The risk of death and stroke is very low for patients having cardioversion procedures.
Malignant arrhythmias (torsade de pointes, sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, all of which are associated with high 1-year mortality rate) were observed for dofetilide, ibutilide, sotalol, quinidine and vernakalant, justifying the need for special care and closer monitoring when using these drugs. Duration of hospitalisation data was available in three studies but, as there were variable timings in these studies, we could not combine them to assess their joint effectiveness. These studies suggest that the duration of hospitalisation may be lower with electrical cardioversion.
Heart failure was observed in some patients treated with propafenone, flecainide, sotalol, amiodarone, vernakalant, and placebo, and was not observed in patients receiving electrical cardioversion, suggesting that the latter approach should be the preferred one if concerns exist regarding the occurrence of this outcome.
Phlebitis (i.e. inflammation of the vein caused by using injectable drugs) occurred frequently in patients treated with amiodarone, and dysgeusia (i.e. impairment of the sense of taste) and sneezing occurred frequently in patients receiving vernakalant.
We are sure or moderately sure of the results for the efficacy of treatments available for persistent AF and atrial flutter. We are less sure about the results for some of the treatment options for paroxysmal AF.
Not enough data are available regarding quality of life, and data were limited regarding duration of hospital stay.

zhiweny2@illinois.edu,interactive_3,Physician use of red flags to screen for fractured vertebrae for patients with new back pain,"Low-back pain (LBP) is a common condition seen in primary care. A principal aim during a clinical examination is to identify patients with a higher likelihood of underlying serious pathology, such as vertebral fracture, who may require additional investigation and specific treatment. All 'evidence-based' clinical practice guidelines recommend the use of red flags to screen for serious causes of back pain. However, it remains unclear if the diagnostic accuracy of red flags is sufficient to support this recommendation.
To assess the diagnostic accuracy of red flags obtained in a clinical history or physical examination to screen for vertebral fracture in patients presenting with LBP.
Electronic databases were searched for primary studies between the earliest date and 7 March 2012. Forward and backward citation searching of eligible studies was also conducted.
Studies were considered if they compared the results of any aspect of the history or test conducted in the physical examination of patients presenting for LBP or examination of the lumbar spine, with a reference standard (diagnostic imaging). The selection criteria were independently applied by two review authors.
Three review authors independently conducted 'Risk of bias' assessment and data extraction. Risk of bias was assessed using the 11-item QUADAS tool. Characteristics of studies, patients, index tests and reference standards were extracted. Where available, raw data were used to calculate sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Due to the heterogeneity of studies and tests, statistical pooling was not appropriate and the analysis for the review was descriptive only. Likelihood ratios for each test were calculated and used as an indication of clinical usefulness.
Eight studies set in primary (four), secondary (one) and tertiary care (accident and emergency = three) were included in the review. Overall, the risk of bias of studies was moderate with high risk of selection and verification bias the predominant flaws. Reporting of index and reference tests was poor. The prevalence of vertebral fracture in accident and emergency settings ranged from 6.5% to 11% and in primary care from 0.7% to 4.5%. There were 29 groups of index tests investigated however, only two featured in more than two studies. Descriptive analyses revealed that three red flags in primary care were potentially useful with meaningful positive likelihood ratios (LR+) but mostly imprecise estimates (significant trauma, older age, corticosteroid use; LR+ point estimate ranging 3.42 to 12.85, 3.69 to 9.39, 3.97 to 48.50 respectively). One red flag in tertiary care appeared informative (contusion/abrasion; LR+ 31.09, 95% CI 18.25 to 52.96). The results of combined tests appeared more informative than individual red flags with LR+ estimates generally greater in magnitude and precision.
The available evidence does not support the use of many red flags to specifically screen for vertebral fracture in patients presenting for LBP. Based on evidence from single studies, few individual red flags appear informative as most have poor diagnostic accuracy as indicated by imprecise estimates of likelihood ratios. When combinations of red flags were used the performance appeared to improve. From the limited evidence, the findings give rise to a weak recommendation that a combination of a small subset of red flags may be useful to screen for vertebral fracture. It should also be noted that many red flags have high false positive rates; and if acted upon uncritically there would be consequences for the cost of management and outcomes of patients with LBP. Further research should focus on appropriate sets of red flags and adequate reporting of both index and reference tests.","This review describes the understanding of a common practice for checking for spinal injuries when patients come to a family practice doctor, back pain clinic or emergency room with new back pain. Doctors usually ask a few questions and examine the back to check for the possibility of a spinal fracture. The reason for this check for fractures is that the treatment is different for common back pain and fractures. Fractures are usually diagnosed with an x-ray, then treated with rest, a back brace and pain relievers. Common back pain is treated with exercise, chiropractic manipulation, and pain relievers; x-rays, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging scans are not useful for diagnosis. Fractures are rare, being the cause of back pain in the range of 1% to 4.5% of new back pain visits to family doctors.
Eight studies including several thousand patients described 29 different questions and physical exam tests that have been used to look for spinal fractures. Most of the 29 were not accurate. The best four questions asked about use of steroids (which can cause weak bones), the patient's age (age above 74 increases the risk of fractures) and recent trauma such as a fall. Using a combination of the best questions appears to improve the accuracy. For example, women above age 74 are more likely to have a fracture when they come to the physician complaining of back pain. In the emergency room, the best indication of a spinal fracture was a bruise or scrape on the painful area of the back.
Fractures are rare and generally do not require emergency treatment, even if red flags exist clinicians and patients can watch and wait. During the waiting period, patients should avoid treatments like exercise and manipulation that are not recommended for spinal fractures.
The worst effects of low quality red flag screening are overtreatment and undertreatment. If the tests are not accurate, patients without a fracture may get an x-ray or CT scan that they don’t need—unnecessary exposure to x-rays, extra worry for the patient and extra cost. At the other extreme (and much less common), it might be possible to miss a real fracture, and cause the patient to have extra time without the best treatment.
Most of the studies were of low or moderate quality, so more research is needed to identify the best combination of questions and examination methods.",1052,"Low-back pain, vertebral fracture, red flags, diagnostic accuracy, likelihood ratios, clinical examination, primary care, sensitivity and specificity, reference standard, risk of bias",What was the study trying to examine regarding the use of red flags in the context of low-back pain?,What methods were used in the study to gather and analyze data regarding red flags for vertebral fractures?,What were the key results found in the study regarding the usefulness and diagnostic accuracy of red flags for detecting vertebral fractures?
zhiweny2@illinois.edu,interactive_3,Drug or psychological interventions for preventing depression in people with long-term physical conditions,"Major depression is one of the world�s leading causes of disability in adults with long-term physical conditions compared to those without physical illness. This co-morbidity is associated with a negative prognosis in terms of increased morbidity and mortality rates, increased healthcare costs, decreased adherence to treatment regimens, and a substantial decline in quality of life. Therefore, preventing the onset of depressive episodes in adults with long-term physical conditions should be a global healthcare aim. In this review, primary or tertiary (in cases of preventing recurrences in those with a history of depression) prevention are the focus. While primary prevention aims at preventing the onset of depression, tertiary prevention comprises both preventing recurrences and prohibiting relapses. Tertiary prevention aims to address a depressive episode that might still be present, is about to subside, or has recently resolved. We included tertiary prevention in the case where the focus was preventing the onset of depression in those with a history of depression (preventing recurrences) but excluded it if it specifically focused on maintaining an condition or implementing rehabilitation services (relapse prevention). Secondary prevention of depression seeks to prevent the progression of depressive symptoms by early detection and treatment and may therefore be considered a 'treatment,' rather than prevention. We therefore exclude the whole spectrum of secondary prevention. To assess the effectiveness, acceptability and tolerability of psychological or pharmacological interventions, in comparison to control conditions, in preventing depression in adults with long-term physical conditions; either before first ever onset of depressive symptoms (i.e. primary prevention) or before first onset of depressive symptoms in patients with a history of depression (i.e. tertiary prevention). We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and two trials registries, up to 6 February 2020. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of preventive psychological or pharmacological interventions, specifically targeting incidence of depression in comparison to treatment as usual (TAU), waiting list, attention/psychological placebo, or placebo. Participants had to be age 18 years or older, with at least one long-term physical condition, and no diagnosis of major depression at baseline (primary prevention). In addition, we included studies comprising mixed samples of patients with and without a history of depression, which explored tertiary prevention of recurrent depression. We excluded other tertiary prevention studies. We also excluded secondary preventive interventions. Primary outcomes included incidence of depression, tolerability, and acceptability. Secondary outcomes included severity of depression, cost-effectiveness and cost-utility. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We included 11 RCTs, with one trial on psychological interventions, and 10 trials on pharmacological interventions. Data analyses on the psychological intervention (problem-solving therapy compared to TAU) included 194 participants with age-related macular degeneration. Data analyses on pharmacological interventions included 837 participants comparing citalopram (one trial), escitalopram (three trials), a mixed sample of fluoxetine/nortriptyline (one trial), melatonin (one trial), milnacipran (one trial), and sertraline (three trials), each to placebo. Included types of long-term physical conditions were acute coronary syndrome (one trial), breast cancer (one trial), head and neck cancer (two trials), stroke (five trials), and traumatic brain injury (one trial). Very low-certainty evidence of one study suggests that problem solving therapy may be slightly more effective than TAU in preventing the incidence of depression, immediately post-intervention (odds ratio (OR) 0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.20 to 0.95; 194 participants). However, there may be little to no difference between groups at six months follow-up (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.38; 190 participants; one study; very low-certainty evidence). No data were available regarding incidence of depression after six months. Regarding acceptability (drop-outs due to any cause), slightly fewer drop-outs occurred in the TAU group immediately post-intervention (OR 5.21, 95% CI 1.11 to 24.40; 206 participants; low-certainty evidence). After six months, however, the groups did not differ (OR 1.67, 95% CI 0.58 to 4.77; 206 participants; low-certainty evidence). This study did not measure tolerability. Post-intervention, compared to placebo, antidepressants may be beneficial in preventing depression in adults with different types of long-term physical conditions, but the evidence is very uncertain (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.49; 814 participants; nine studies; I2 = 0%; very low-certainty evidence). There may be little to no difference between groups both immediately and at six months follow-up (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.08 to 2.46; 23 participants; one study; very low-certainty evidence) as well as at six to 12 months follow-up (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.23 to 2.82; 233 participants; three studies; I2 = 49%; very low-certainty evidence). There was very low-certainty evidence from five studies regarding the tolerability of the pharmacological intervention. A total of 669 adverse events were observed in 316 participants from the pharmacological intervention group, and 610 adverse events from 311 participants in the placebo group. There was very low-certainty evidence that drop-outs due to adverse events may be less frequent in the placebo group (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.07 to 3.89; 561 participants; five studies; I2 = 0%). There was also very low-certainty evidence that drop-outs due to any cause may not differ between groups either post-intervention (OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.73; 962 participants; nine studies; I2 = 28%), or at six to 12 months (OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.86; 327 participants; three studies; I2 = 0%). Based on evidence of very low certainty, our results may indicate the benefit of pharmacological interventions, during or directly after preventive treatment. Few trials examined short-term outcomes up to six months, nor the follow-up effects at six to 12 months, with studies suffering from great numbers of drop-outs and inconclusive results. Generalisation of results is limited as study populations and treatment regimes were very heterogeneous. Based on the results of this review, we conclude that for adults with long-term physical conditions, there is only very uncertain evidence regarding the implementation of any primary preventive interventions (psychological/pharmacological) for depression.","People with long-term illness or other physical health conditions have a higher risk than other people of developing depression. This can reduce their quality of life. Depression is characterised by symptoms such as low mood, feelings of hopelessness, loss of interest in things that once gave pleasure, and other symptoms, as well as sleep disturbances. People with long-term physical conditions who develop depression are more likely to worsen in their illnesses and are more likely to die. Therefore, preventing depression in people with long-term physical conditions should be an important goal in healthcare. We wanted to know whether standard interventions for treating depression (i.e. psychological treatments and antidepressant drugs) can also safely be used to prevent the onset of an depressive episode in those adults at high risk for depression due to their long-term physical condition, but who do not yet show depressive symptoms. We also wanted to know whether these interventions worked in preventing recurrent depression, in those patients with long-term physical conditions who had a history of depression. First, we searched the medical literature for randomised controlled studies (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups). This type of study provides the most robust evidence about the effects of a treatment. We then compared the results, and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we assessed how certain the evidence was. To do this, we considered factors such as the way studies were conducted, study sizes, and consistency of findings across studies. Based on our assessments, we categorised the evidence as being of very low, low, moderate or high certainty. Medical and mental health care providers (including physicians and psychologists) and pharmacists, as well as adults with long-term physical conditions, their relatives and care-givers. This review includes 11 trials comparing a psychological intervention (problem-solving therapy) to treatment as usual; or comparing pharmacological antidepressant interventions (citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline, fluoxetine/nortriptyline, milnacipran, or melatonin) to placebo. For the psychological intervention, we found only one trial, including 194 people with age-related macular degeneration (an eye disease). For pharmacological interventions, we included 10 trials comprising 1009 people. Due to some participants not completing the studies, we could only analyse data for 837 participants. Our analyses show that people with long-term physical conditions may be less likely to develop depression during treatment with problem solving therapy, or with different types of antidepressants. However, these interventions appear to be beneficial only during treatment. Three to 12 months after treatment, there was no significant difference in onset of depression between the groups that had the interventions and those that did not. Therefore, preventive interventions might be effective in preventing depression onset only for the duration of the intervention. Our conclusions are based on evidence of very low certainty. In addition, there is not enough adequate information on the tolerability (unpleasant but generally medically less important adverse events due to the intervention, e.g. dry mouth) and acceptability (willingness to go through with the intervention even in the presence of adverse events) of these treatments. The interventions may be unsafe, irrespective of their potential to prevent depression.",1119,"Major depression, long-term physical conditions, co-morbidity, primary prevention, tertiary prevention, randomised controlled trials (RCTs), psychological interventions, pharmacological interventions, incidence of depression, tolerability.",What was the study trying to examine regarding preventive interventions for depression in adults with long-term physical conditions?,What methods were used in the study to assess the effectiveness of psychological and pharmacological interventions?,What were the results found in the study concerning the effectiveness and certainty of the preventive interventions?
zhiweny2@illinois.edu,interactive_4,Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor agonists for acute stroke,"Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor agonists have been shown to have a neuroprotectant effect in reducing infarct size and improving functional outcome in animal models of cerebrovascular disease. However, the sedative effects of GABA receptor agonists have limited their wider application in people with acute stroke, due to the potential risk of stupor. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2013, and previously updated in 2014 and 2016. To determine the efficacy and safety of GABA receptor agonists in the treatment of acute stroke. We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (accessed May 2018), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) 2018, Issue 4 (accessed May 2018), MEDLINE (from 1949 to May 2018), Embase (from 1980 to May 2018), CINAHL (from 1982 to May 2018), AMED (from 1985 to May 2018), and 11 Chinese databases (accessed May 2018). In an effort to identify further published, unpublished, and ongoing trials we searched ongoing trial registers, reference lists, and relevant conference proceedings, and contacted authors and pharmaceutical companies. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating GABA receptor agonists versus placebo for people with acute stroke (within 12 hours after stroke onset), with the primary outcomes of efficacy and safety. Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of identified records, selected studies for inclusion, extracted eligible data, cross-checked the data for accuracy, and assessed the risk of bias. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence. We included five trials with 3838 participants (acute ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke patients, 3758 analyzed). Most of the participants recruited had acute ischaemic stroke, with limited data available from participants with other stroke subtypes, including total anterior circulation syndrome (TACS). The methodological quality of the included trials was generally good, with an unclear risk for selection bias only. For death and dependency at three months, pooled results did not find a significant difference for chlormethiazole versus placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96 to 1.11; four trials; 2909 participants; moderate-quality evidence) and for diazepam versus placebo (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.07; one trial; 849 participants; moderate-quality evidence). The most frequent adverse events related to chlormethiazole were somnolence (RR 4.56, 95% CI 3.50 to 5.95; two trials; 2527 participants; moderate-quality evidence) and rhinitis (RR 4.75, 95% CI 2.67 to 8.46; two trials; 2527 participants; moderate-quality evidence). This review provides moderate-quality evidence that fails to support the use of GABA receptor agonists (chlormethiazole or diazepam) for the treatment of people with acute stroke. More well-designed RCTs with large samples of participants with total anterior circulation syndrome are required to determine if there are benefits for this subgroup. Somnolence and rhinitis are frequent adverse events related to chlormethiazole.","Background : GABA receptor agonists are a type of drug that may help protect the brain in acute stroke. This group of drugs, which includes diazepam and chlormethiazole, has been used as traditional sedatives for several decades, and have been found to be beneficial in stroke studies in animals. However, the sedative effect of GABA receptor agonists could be harmful for people with acute stroke. Study characteristics : We identified five studies to May 2018 that met our inclusion criteria; they randomized 3838 participants (acute ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke patients) and analyzed 3758. The quality of all the studies was generally good, with a low risk of bias. One study tested the effects and safety of diazepam for acute stroke in 849 participants within 12 hours of stroke onset. Four studies tested the effects and safety of chlormethiazole in 2909 participants with acute stroke, within 12 hours of stroke onset; 95 participants had stroke caused by bleeding and were analyzed separately. Key results : All five trials reported death and dependency at three months. There was no significant difference between the chlormethiazole and placebo groups or between the diazepam and placebo groups. The most frequent side effects caused by chlormethiazole were drowsiness and nasal irritation. Quality of the evidence : In conclusion, moderate-quality evidence did not support the use of GABA receptor agonists for the treatment of people with acute stroke.",1065,"Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor agonists, acute stroke, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), chlormethiazole, efficacy and safety, risk ratio (RR), 95% confidence interval (CI), placebo, somnolence, rhinitis",What was the study trying to determine about GABA receptor agonists in acute stroke treatment?,What methods were used to identify and analyze relevant trials in the study?,What were the study's findings on the efficacy and adverse events of GABA receptor agonists like chlormethiazole and diazepam?
zhiweny2@illinois.edu,interactive_4,Fixed-dose combination drug therapy for the prevention of heart disease and stroke,"Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) remains the leading cause of death and disability worldwide, yet many people still do not receive adequate treatment to control their risk factors. One strategy proposed to help address this gap is the use of a fixed-dose combination pill�often called a �polypill��that combines blood pressure-lowering drugs, cholesterol-lowering medication, and sometimes antiplatelet therapy into a single tablet taken daily. This review evaluated whether such fixed-dose combination therapy leads to fewer deaths, fewer heart attacks and strokes, improved adherence to medication, and better control of cardiovascular risk factors compared with usual care, placebo, or taking medications separately. We included 13 randomised controlled trials involving a total of 9059 adults; four of these trials were new additions in this update. Most studies involved people without established ASCVD, and follow-up ranged from six weeks to nearly two years. Participants were generally in their early 60s, and about one-third were women. Newer studies tended to be larger, longer, and had a lower risk of bias. However, a major limitation across all trials was the inability to blind participants or researchers to the treatment since the fixed-dose pill differs visibly from usual care, which could influence reported outcomes. Overall, the effects of fixed-dose combination therapy on important clinical outcomes, such as death or major cardiovascular events, remain uncertain. About 1% of participants in both the fixed-dose and control groups died during the trials, showing no clear difference (risk ratio 1.10, 95% confidence interval 0.64 to 1.89). Similarly, the proportion of people who experienced a heart attack or stroke was small (4.7% in the fixed-dose group versus 3.7% in the control group), and the evidence did not show a clear effect (risk ratio 1.26, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.66). These findings are limited by the low number of events and the fact that most trials focused on risk factor changes rather than long-term outcomes. Side effects occurred commonly in both groups, but people taking the fixed-dose pill were somewhat more likely to report an adverse event (32% versus 27%), meaning a 16% increased risk. This is not unexpected since the polypill combines several medications known to cause side effects individually. Despite this, the fixed-dose combination showed consistent improvements in risk factor control. On average, systolic blood pressure was lowered by about 6 mmHg compared with usual care, and LDL cholesterol dropped by approximately 0.70 mmol/L. Total cholesterol also decreased modestly. However, these results showed substantial statistical variation between trials, so they should be interpreted cautiously. A key advantage of fixed-dose combination therapy was improved medication adherence. Across four studies, adherence to treatment was 44% higher among participants taking the polypill than among those receiving usual care. This suggests that simplifying treatment into a single pill may help more people take their medications consistently. In summary, while fixed-dose combination therapy improves blood pressure, cholesterol, and adherence, current evidence is insufficient to determine whether it reduces heart attacks, strokes, or deaths. Most trials were not designed or powered to assess these major outcomes, which likely explains the lack of clear effects. Fixed-dose therapy does appear to increase minor side effects but may help patients stay on treatment better. Ongoing and longer-term studies will be critical to determine whether the improvements in risk factors observed with polypill therapy eventually translate into meaningful reductions in cardiovascular events.","We examined the evidence on whether using fixed-dose combination drug therapy can help prevent heart attacks and strokes. This approach combines several medications�typically drugs that lower blood pressure and cholesterol�into a single pill. We identified 13 studies involving 9059 adults. The evidence is current up to September 2016. Researchers wanted to know if taking multiple preventive medications in a single pill was better or worse than usual care, placebo, or taking each drug separately. This updated review includes studies published since the previous Cochrane Review from 2014. Four of the included studies involved people who already had a previous heart attack or stroke, or who were at high risk of having one. Five studies followed participants for 12 months or longer. Most of the participants were middle-aged men with moderately high blood pressure or cholesterol levels, and two studies specifically included large numbers of Aboriginal or M?ori participants. The fixed-dose pills in these trials contained between two and five medications, but all combinations included at least one drug to lower blood pressure and one to lower cholesterol. A major limitation across studies was that neither the participants nor the researchers could be blinded to the treatment, which could influence the results. The findings showed that it is still uncertain whether fixed-dose combination therapy reduces the risk of death, heart attacks, or strokes. Very few participants in the trials experienced these events�less than 5%�making it difficult to determine the true effect. The comparison with usual care also provided low-quality evidence, meaning confidence in these results is limited. Participants taking fixed-dose combination pills experienced more side effects compared with those in the control groups (32% versus 27%). This is expected because the medications involved�such as aspirin, blood pressure-lowering drugs, and cholesterol-lowering drugs�are known to cause side effects when taken individually. The combined pill may slightly reduce blood pressure by about 6 mmHg and lower LDL cholesterol by approximately 0.6 mmol/L, though these benefits were not seen consistently across all studies. Importantly, fixed-dose combination therapy did improve how regularly people took their preventive medications, suggesting better adherence overall. The overall quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to low, meaning that while some findings are fairly reliable, others remain uncertain. Ongoing and future clinical trials using fixed-dose combination therapy are expected to provide clearer evidence about its impact on major outcomes such as heart attacks, strokes, and deaths.",1048,"Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, fixed-dose combination therapy, polypill, blood pressure-lowering drugs, cholesterol-lowering medication, antiplatelet therapy, randomised controlled trials, cardiovascular risk factors, major cardiovascular events, medication adherence.",What was the focus of the study concerning the effects of the fixed-dose combination pill on ASCVD?,What methods were employed in the study to evaluate the outcomes of fixed-dose combination therapy?,What were the key results regarding the impact of fixed-dose combination therapy on clinical outcomes such as heart attacks and strokes?
zhiweny2@illinois.edu,interactive_4,Self-management interventions including action plans for patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD),"Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) self-management interventions should be structured but personalised and often multi-component, with the goal of motivating, engaging, and supporting patients to adapt their behaviour and develop skills to better manage the disease. Exacerbation action plans are considered a key component of COPD self-management, but studies assessing these interventions have shown contradictory results. This review compared the effectiveness of COPD self-management interventions that include action plans for acute exacerbations with usual care. We evaluated the efficacy of COPD-specific self-management interventions that include an action plan for exacerbations compared with usual care in terms of health-related quality of life, respiratory-related hospital admissions, and other health outcomes. We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials, trials registries, and reference lists of included studies up to May 2016. We included randomised controlled trials published since 1995 that evaluated a self-management intervention for people with COPD. Eligible interventions included a written action plan for exacerbations and an iterative process between participants and healthcare providers in which feedback was provided. We excluded pulmonary rehabilitation programmes and group exercise classes to avoid overlap. Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data, resolving disagreements through consensus or with a third author. When appropriate, results were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. Primary outcomes were health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and the number of respiratory-related hospital admissions. We included 22 studies involving 3,854 participants with COPD. Follow-up ranged from two to 24 months, and intervention content varied widely. Over 12 months, self-management interventions with action plans showed a statistically significant beneficial effect on HRQoL, measured using the St. George�s Respiratory Questionnaire, with a mean difference of �2.69 points compared with usual care. Participants receiving self-management interventions were also at lower risk of at least one respiratory-related hospital admission (OR 0.69). The number needed to treat to prevent one respiratory-related admission over one year ranged from 12 to 17, depending on baseline risk. There was no statistically significant difference in all-cause hospital admission risk, number of hospitalisation days, emergency department visits, general practitioner visits, dyspnoea scores, number of COPD exacerbations, or all-cause mortality. Exploratory analysis showed a small but significantly higher respiratory-related mortality rate in the self-management group. Subgroup analyses showed that including a smoking cessation programme produced greater improvements in HRQoL than interventions without one. Other factors, such as the number of behavioural change techniques, intervention duration, and medication adaptation within action plans, did not significantly influence HRQoL. No variables were identified to explain differences in respiratory-related hospital admissions. Self-management interventions that include a COPD exacerbation action plan are associated with improved HRQoL and reduced respiratory-related hospital admissions. No excess all-cause mortality was observed, but there may be a small increase in respiratory-related mortality. Future studies should ensure that action plans are used only as part of interventions meeting the most up-to-date COPD self-management criteria and should provide clearer descriptions of intervention components to support further subgroup analyses. Action plans should account for comorbidities to increase safety, and future COPD self-management trials should involve Data and Safety Monitoring Boards.","We looked at the evidence on the effects of self-management interventions that include action plans for when COPD symptoms get worse, focusing on health-related quality of life and hospital admissions related to lung disease. People with COPD experience symptoms that worsen over time, leading to reduced well-being. Self-management interventions teach individuals what to do in different situations, including when symptoms worsen, helping them build skills and adopt behaviors that support managing their disease. Action plans outline specific steps to take when symptoms escalate. The effectiveness of these action plans has not been completely clear, even though they are now a common and central component of COPD management. We searched studies up to May 2016 and included 22 randomized trials with 3,854 participants. All studies compared self-management interventions that included an action plan to usual care, with follow-up periods ranging from two to 24 months. Self-management interventions that included an action plan improved health-related quality of life compared with usual care. They also reduced the number of people who had at least one hospital admission related to lung disease. However, there was a small but significant increase in respiratory-related deaths in the self-management group. The studies varied in the content of self-management programs, action plans, and the types of participants included. Although we could not determine which specific components were most effective, including a smoking cessation program appeared to further improve health-related quality of life.",1072,"COPD self-management interventions, exacerbation action plans, health-related quality of life, respiratory-related hospital admissions, randomised controlled trials, St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire, respiratory-related mortality, self-management group, smoking cessation programme, behavioural change techniques",What was the study trying to examine regarding COPD self-management interventions?,What methods were used to evaluate the COPD self-management interventions in the reviewed studies?,What were the key results found in terms of health-related quality of life and respiratory-related hospital admissions?
zhiweny2@illinois.edu,finetuned_5,Using computers to self-manage type 2 diabetes,"Diabetes is one of the commonest chronic medical conditions, affecting around 347 million adults worldwide. Structured patient education programmes reduce the risk of diabetes-related complications four-fold. Internet-based self-management programmes have been shown to be effective for a number of long-term conditions, but it is unclear what  are the essential or effective components of such programmes. If computer-based self-management interventions improve outcomes in type 2 diabetes, they could potentially provide a cost-effective option for reducing the burdens placed on patients and healthcare systems by this long-term condition.
To assess the effects on health status and health-related quality of life of computer-based diabetes self-management interventions for adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
We searched six electronic bibliographic databases for published articles and conference proceedings and three online databases for theses (all up to November 2011). Reference lists of relevant reports and reviews were also screened.
Randomised controlled trials of computer-based self-management interventions for adults with type 2 diabetes, i.e. computer-based software applications that respond to user input and aim to generate tailored content to improve one or more self-management domains through feedback, tailored advice, reinforcement and rewards, patient decision support, goal setting or reminders.
Two review authors independently screened the abstracts and extracted data. A taxonomy for behaviour change techniques was used to describe the active ingredients of the intervention.
We identified 16 randomised controlled trials with 3578 participants that fitted our inclusion criteria. These studies included a wide spectrum of interventions covering clinic-based brief interventions, Internet-based interventions that could be used from home and mobile phone-based interventions. The mean age of participants was between 46 to 67 years old and mean time since diagnosis was 6 to 13 years. The duration of the interventions varied between 1 to 12 months. There were three reported deaths out of 3578 participants. Computer-based diabetes self-management interventions currently have limited effectiveness. They appear to have small benefits on glycaemic control (pooled effect on glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c): -2.3 mmol/mol or -0.2% (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.4 to -0.1; P = 0.009; 2637 participants; 11 trials). The effect size on HbA1c was larger in the mobile phone subgroup (subgroup analysis: mean difference in HbA1c -5.5 mmol/mol or -0.5% (95% CI -0.7 to -0.3); P < 0.00001; 280 participants; three trials). Current interventions do not show adequate evidence for improving depression, health-related quality of life or weight. Four (out of 10) interventions showed beneficial effects on lipid profile. One participant withdrew because of anxiety but there were no other documented adverse effects. Two studies provided limited cost-effectiveness data - with one study suggesting costs per patient of less than $140 (in 1997) or 105 EURO and another study showed no change in health behaviour and resource utilisation.
Computer-based diabetes self-management interventions to manage type 2 diabetes appear to have a small beneficial effect on blood glucose control and the effect was larger in the mobile phone subgroup. There is no evidence to show benefits in other biological outcomes or any cognitive, behavioural or emotional outcomes.","Diabetes is one of the commonest long-term medical conditions, affecting around 347 million adults worldwide. Around 90% of them have type 2 diabetes and are at significant risk of developing diabetes related complications such as strokes or heart attacks. Patient education programmes can reduce the risk of diabetes-related complications, but many people with type 2 diabetes have never attended structured education programmes to learn how to look after themselves (self-management). Better use of computers might be one way of helping more people learn about self-management.
We identified 16 trials involving 3578 adults that met our criteria. These studies included different types of interventions used in different places like touch screen computers in hospital clinics, computers connected to the Internet at home and programmes that communicated with mobile phones. The average age of people taking part was between 46 to 67 years old and most of those people had lived with diabetes for 6 to 13 years. Participants were given access to the interventions for 1 to 12 months, depending on the intervention. Three out of the 3578 participants died but these deaths did not appear to be linked to the trials.
Overall, there is evidence that computer programmes have a small beneficial effect on blood sugar control - the estimated improvement in glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c - a long-term measurement of metabolic control) was 2.3 mmol/mol or 0.2%. This was slightly higher when we looked at studies that used mobile phones to deliver their intervention - the estimated improvement in HbA1c was 5.5 mmol/mol or 0.5% in the studies that used mobile phones. Some of the programmes lowered cholesterol slightly. None of the programmes helped with weight loss or coping with depression.
One participant withdrew because of anxiety but there were no obvious side effects and hypoglycaemic episodes were not reported in any of the studies. There was very little information about costs or value for money.
In summary, existing computer programmes to help adults self-manage type 2 diabetes appear to have a small positive effect on blood sugar control and the mobile phone interventions appeared to have larger effects. There is no evidence to show that current programmes can help with weight loss, depression or improving health-related quality of life but they do appear to be safe.",1003,"Diabetes, computer-based self-management interventions, type 2 diabetes mellitus, randomised controlled trials, glycaemic control, glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), mobile phone subgroup, lipid profile, health-related quality of life, cost-effectiveness data",What was the main aim of the study regarding computer-based diabetes self-management interventions for adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus?,Which methods and databases were utilized in conducting the study on computer-based self-management interventions for type 2 diabetes?,"What were the key outcomes of the study concerning the effectiveness of computer-based diabetes self-management interventions, particularly in terms of glycaemic control?"
zhiweny2@illinois.edu,finetuned_5,Does galantamine help people with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease and people with mild cognitive impairment?,"Dementia leads to progressive cognitive decline, and represents a significant health and societal burden. Its prevalence is growing, with Alzheimer's disease as the leading cause. There is no cure for Alzheimer's disease, but there are regulatory-approved pharmacological interventions, such as galantamine, for symptomatic relief.  To assess the clinical effects, including adverse effects, of galantamine in people with probable or possible Alzheimer's disease or mild cognitive impairment, and to investigate potential moderators of effect. We systematically searched the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialised Register on 14 December 2022 using the term 'galantamine'. The Register contains records of clinical trials identified from major electronic databases (including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase), trial registries, grey literature sources, and conference proceedings. We manually searched reference lists and collected information from US Food and Drug Administration documents and unpublished trial reports. We imposed no language restrictions. We included double-blind, parallel-group, randomised controlled trials comparing oral galantamine with placebo for a treatment duration exceeding four weeks in people with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease or with mild cognitive impairment. Working independently, two review authors selected studies for inclusion, assessed their quality, and extracted data. Outcomes of interest included cognitive function, change in global function, activities of daily living, functional disability, behavioural function, and adverse events. We used a fixed-effect model for meta-analytic synthesis, and presented results as Peto odds ratios (OR) or weighted mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals. We used Cochrane's original risk of bias tool (RoB 1) to assess the risk of bias in the included studies. We included 21 studies with a total of 10,990 participants. The average age of participants was 74 years, and 37% were male. The studies' durations ranged from eight weeks to two years, with 24 weeks being the most common duration. One newly included study assessed the effects of galantamine at two years, and another newly included study involved participants with severe Alzheimer's disease. Nineteen studies with 10,497 participants contributed data to the meta-analysis. All studies had low to unclear risk of bias for randomisation, allocation concealment, and blinding. We judged four studies to be at high risk of bias due to attrition and two due to selective outcome reporting. Galantamine for dementia due to Alzheimer's disease We summarise only the results for galantamine given at 8 to 12 mg twice daily (total galantamine 16 mg to 24 mg/day), assessed at six months. See the full review for results of other dosing regimens and assessment time points. There is high-certainty evidence that, compared to placebo, galantamine improves: cognitive function, as assessed with the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale – Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-cog) (MD-2.86, 95% CI -3.29 to -2.43; 6 studies, 3049 participants; minimum clinically important effect (MCID) = 2.6- to 4-point change); functional disability, as assessed with the Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD) scale (MD 2.12, 95% CI 0.75 to 3.49; 3 studies, 1275 participants); and behavioural function, as assessed with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) (MD -1.63, 95% CI -3.07 to -0.20; 2 studies, 1043 participants) at six months. Galantamine may improve global function at six months, as assessed with the Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change plus Caregiver Input (CIBIC-plus) (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.36 to 1.84; 6 studies, 3002 participants; low-certainty evidence). Participants who received galantamine were more likely than placebo-treated participants to discontinue prematurely (22.7% versus 17.2%) (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.68; 6 studies, 3336 participants; high-certainty evidence), and experience nausea (20.9% versus 8.4%) (OR 2.89, 95% CI 2.40 to 3.49; 7 studies, 3616 participants; high-certainty evidence) during the studies. Galantamine reduced death rates at six months: 1.3% of participants in the galantamine groups had died compared to 2.3% in the placebo groups (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.96; 6 studies, 3493 participants; high-certainty evidence). Galantamine for mild cognitive impairment We summarise results, assessed at two years, from two studies that gave participants galantamine at 8 to 12 mg twice daily (total galantamine 16 mg to 24 mg/day). Compared to placebo, galantamine may not improve cognitive function, as assessed with the expanded ADAS-cog for mild cognitive impairment (MD -0.21, 95% CI -0.78 to 0.37; 2 studies, 1901 participants; low-certainty evidence) or activities of daily living, assessed with the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study – Activities of Daily Living scale for mild cognitive impairment (MD 0.30, 95% CI -0.26 to 0.86; 2 studies, 1901 participants; low-certainty evidence). Participants who received galantamine were probably more likely to discontinue prematurely than placebo-treated participants (40.7% versus 28.6%) (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.42 to 2.05; 2 studies, 2057 participants) and to experience nausea (29.4% versus 10.7%) (OR 3.49, 95% CI 2.75 to 4.44; 2 studies, 2057 participants), both with moderate-certainty evidence. Galantamine may not reduce death rates at 24 months compared to placebo (0.5% versus 0.1%) (OR 5.03, 95% CI 0.87 to 29.10; 2 studies, 2057 participants; low-certainty evidence). Results from subgroup analysis and meta-regression suggest that an imbalance in discontinuation rates between galantamine and placebo groups, together with the use of the 'last observation carried forward' approach to outcome assessment, may potentially bias cognitive outcomes in favour of galantamine. Compared to placebo, galantamine (when given at a total dose of 16 mg to 24 mg/day) slows the decline in cognitive function, functional ability, and behaviour at six months in people with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. Galantamine probably also slows declines in global function at six months. The changes observed in cognition, assessed with the ADAS-cog scale, were clinically meaningful. Gastrointestinal-related adverse events are the primary concerns associated with galantamine use in people with dementia, which may limit its tolerability. Although death rates were generally low, participants in the galantamine groups had a reduced risk of death compared to those in the placebo groups. There is no evidence to support the use of galantamine in people with mild cognitive impairment.","Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia among older people that causes problems with memory, thinking, and behaviour. The disease worsens over time to the extent that it affects a person's ability to carry out day-to-day tasks. For people with mild cognitive impairment, symptoms affecting thinking and memory are mild and usually not serious enough to interfere with daily life and activities. Currently, there is no cure for Alzheimer's disease, but medications that can help with symptoms are available. Galantamine is one of the three cholinesterase inhibitor medications approved by the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Galantamine works by increasing the levels of a chemical in the brain, acetylcholine, that transmits signals, which may help with symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. There are no medications currently approved by regulatory bodies as treatments for mild cognitive impairment. We wanted to know whether galantamine is effective and helpful in improving the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment, in terms of memory, ability to carry out self-care, and behaviour. We also wanted to find out if galantamine causes any unwanted effects. We searched for studies that compared galantamine given by mouth to placebo (which does not contain any active ingredients but is given in the same way as the active medication) in people with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, or with mild cognitive impairment. We chose studies in which people were assigned randomly (like a flip of a coin) to receive galantamine or placebo for at least 4 weeks. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 21 studies that involved 10,990 people with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, or with mild cognitive impairment. Their average age was 74 years. Treatment durations ranged from 8 weeks to 2 years. Most studies included people with dementia due to mild or moderate Alzheimer's disease; one study involved people with severe Alzheimer's disease. Three studies included people with mild cognitive impairment. Pharmaceutical companies (Janssen / Johnson & Johnson) sponsored 16 of the 21 included studies. After 6 months of treatment, participants with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease who received galantamine had better memory, ability to do self-care activities, and behaviour than those who received placebo. Importantly, the memory improvements we observed were considered clinically meaningful according to standards set by experts. This same group of participants probably had better overall improvement than those who received placebo. In people with mild cognitive impairment, galantamine, compared to placebo, may make little to no difference in improving memory or the ability to do self-care activities. However, participants who received galantamine probably had a lower risk of progression to dementia after 2 years of treatment. Compared to those taking placebo, people on galantamine were three times more likely to experience gastrointestinal side effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea). The number of deaths was low, and there was no evidence that galantamine caused more deaths than placebo. Many people in the studies (ranging from 17% to 40%) stopped taking their assigned medication early, more so in the galantamine groups than the placebo groups. This is a limitation which may favour galantamine.",1126,"Dementia, Alzheimer's disease, galantamine, cognitive function, mild cognitive impairment, meta-analysis, randomised controlled trials, placebo, adverse events, Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change plus Caregiver Input.",What were the clinical effects and potential moderators of effect that the study was trying to examine with galantamine treatment in Alzheimer's disease?,"What methods did the researchers use to select studies, assess their quality, and extract data for evaluating the effects of galantamine?","What were the main findings regarding the impact of galantamine on cognitive function, functional disability, and behaviour in Alzheimer's patients at six months compared to placebo?"
zhiweny2@illinois.edu,finetuned_5,Prophylactic antibiotic therapy for people with chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD),"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; including chronic bronchitis and emphysema) is a chronic respiratory condition characterised by shortness of breath, cough and recurrent exacerbations. Long-term antibiotic use may reduce both bacterial load and inflammation in the airways. Studies have shown a reduction of exacerbations with antibiotics in comparison to placebo in people with COPD, but there are concerns about antibiotic resistance and safety. To compare the safety and efficacy of different classes of antibiotics (continuous, intermittent or pulsed) for prophylaxis of exacerbations in patients with COPD.
We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Trials Register and bibliographies of relevant studies. The latest literature search was conducted on 6 February 2019.
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were selected that compared one prophylactic antibiotic with another in patients with COPD.
We used the standard Cochrane methods. Two independent review authors selected trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Discrepancies were resolved by involving a third review author.
We included two RCTs, both published in 2015 involving a total of 391 participants with treatment duration of 12 to 13 weeks. One RCT compared a quinolone (moxifloxacin pulsed, for 5 days every 4 weeks), with a tetracycline (doxycycline continuous) or a macrolide (azithromycin intermittent). The second RCT compared a tetracycline (doxycycline continuous) plus a macrolide (roxithromycin continuous), with roxithromycin (continuous) alone. The trials recruited participants with a mean age of 68 years, with moderate-severity COPD. Both trials included participants who had between two and five exacerbations in the previous one to two years. In one trial, 17% of patients had previously been using inhaled corticosteroids. In the other study, all patients were positive for Chlamydophila pneumoniae (C pneumoniae). Overall, we judged the evidence presented to be of very low-certainty, mainly due to imprecision, but we also had concerns about indirectness and methodological quality of the included studies. The primary outcome measures for this review included exacerbations, quality of life, drug resistance and serious adverse events. Macrolide + tetracycline versus macrolide There was no clear difference between treatments in improvement in quality of life as assessed by the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ). The CRQ scale ranges from 0 to 10 and higher scores on the scale indicate better quality of life. CRQ sub-scales for dyspnoea (mean difference (MD) 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.84 to 2.00; 187 participants; very low-certainty evidence), fatigue (MD 0.02, 95% CI -1.08 to 1.12; 187 participants; very low-certainty evidence), emotional function (MD -0.37, 95% CI -1.74 to 1.00; 187 participants; very low-certainty evidence), or mastery (MD -0.79, 95% CI -1.86 to 0.28; 187 participants; very low-certainty evidence) at 12 weeks. For serious adverse events, it was uncertain if there was a difference between combined roxithromycin and doxycycline versus roxithromycin alone at 48 weeks follow-up after active treatment of 12 weeks (odds ratio (OR) 1.00, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.93; 198 participants; very low-certainty evidence). There were five deaths reported in the combined treatment arm, versus three in the single treatment arm at 48 weeks follow-up after active treatment of 12 weeks (OR 1.63, 95% CI 0.38 to 7.02; 198 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Quinolone versus tetracycline There was no clear difference between moxifloxacin and doxycycline for the number of participants experiencing one or more exacerbations (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.38; 50 participants, very low-certainty evidence) at 13 weeks. There were no serious adverse events or deaths reported in either treatment groups. We did not identify any evidence for our other primary outcomes. Quinolone versus macrolide There was no clear difference between moxifloxacin and azithromycin for the number of participants experiencing one or more exacerbations (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.32 to 3.10; 50 participants; very low-certainty evidence) at 13 weeks. There were no serious adverse events or deaths reported in either treatment groups. We did not identify any evidence for our other primary outcomes. Marcolide versus tetracycline There was no clear difference between azithromycin and doxycycline for the number of participants experiencing one or more exacerbations (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.38; 50 participants; very low-certainty evidence) at 13 weeks. There were no serious adverse events or deaths reported in either treatment groups. We did not identify any evidence for our other primary outcomes. We did not find head-to-head evidence for impact of antibiotics on drug resistance. It is not clear from the evidence included in this review whether there is a difference in efficacy or safety between different classes or regimens of prophylactic antibiotic, given for 12 to 13 weeks to people with COPD. Whilst no head-to-head comparisons of antibiotic resistance were identified, concerns about this continue. The sample size in this review is small and both included studies are of short duration. Thus, there is considerable uncertainty in effects observed and the effects of different prophylactic antibiotics requires further research.","COPD is a common condition caused mainly by smoking and can lead to long-term breathing problems. Symptoms include shortness of breath, and cough with sputum production due to airways and lung damage. Infection can trigger severe symptoms, with breathing becoming worse and increased cough and sputum. This is more commonly known as an exacerbation or 'flare-up' which can cause further damage to lung function. Frequent exacerbations can lead to hospital admissions, reduced quality of life, and increase the risk of death.
We wanted to know whether one preventative antibiotic was better than another preventative antibiotic in reducing exacerbations, and improving quality of life for people with COPD.
We found two randomised trials, including 391 people with COPD. The participants had an average age of 68 years. The first study included three groups of COPD patients taking either moxifloxacin (daily for 5 days every 4 weeks), doxycycline (daily for 13 weeks) or azithromycin (3 times per week for 13 weeks). The second study investigated the use of doxycycline (daily) in addition to roxithromycin (daily) for 12 weeks in COPD. Our main outcomes were number of exacerbations, quality of life, serious side effects (known as 'adverse events') and antibiotic resistance.
Overall, we were unable to determine any difference between one antibiotic compared with each other in improving the main outcomes we measured.
We were unclear whether one antibiotic was better or worse than another in terms of reducing exacerbations or improving quality of life. Neither of the studies reported a comparison between antibiotics for drug resistance.
In one study lasting 13 weeks we found no serious side effects of taking moxifloxacin, azithromycin or doxycycline, and no deaths were reported. In the other study, very similar numbers of people experienced serious side effects in both the combined antibiotic and single antibiotic treatment groups after 12 weeks of treatment and 48 weeks of follow-up. However, the numbers were small so we are not sure if one treatment option may cause more side effects than the other. In the same study, five people in the combined treatment group died, compared to three people in the single treatment group. Again, these numbers are too small to draw any conclusions.
We were very uncertain about the results due to finding only two small studies that gave people with COPD antibiotics for only 12 or 13 weeks. The studies only looked at four different antibiotics and did not measure all the things we were interested in.",1080,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), exacerbations, antibiotic resistance, prophylactic antibiotic, risk of bias, Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), macrolide, tetracycline, quinolone, Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ).",What was the main objective of the study regarding the use of antibiotics in COPD patients?,What methods were utilized in the study to select and assess the trials included?,What were the key findings and results regarding the efficacy and safety of different antibiotic regimens in the study?
zhiweny2@illinois.edu,finetuned_6,Chelation therapy for atherosclerotic cardiovascular (heart and circulation) disease,"Chelation therapy is promoted and practiced around the world as a form of alternative medicine in the treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. It has been suggested as a safe, relatively inexpensive, non-surgical method of restoring blood flow in atherosclerotic vessels. However, there is currently limited high-quality, adequately-powered research informing evidence-based medicine on the topic, specifically regarding clinical outcomes. Due to this limited evidence, the benefit of chelation therapy remains controversial at present. This is an update of a review first published in 2002.
To assess the effects of ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) chelation therapy versus placebo or no treatment on clinical outcomes among people with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.
For this update, the Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) databases, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials register to 6 August 2019. We searched the bibliographies of the studies retrieved by the literature searches for further trials.
We included studies if they were randomised controlled trials of EDTA chelation therapy versus placebo or no treatment in participants with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The main outcome measures we considered include all-cause or cause-specific mortality, non-fatal cardiovascular events, direct or indirect measurement of disease severity, and subjective measures of improvement or adverse events.
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality using standard Cochrane procedures. A third author considered any unresolved issues, and we discussed any discrepancies until a consensus was reached. We contacted study authors for additional information.
We included five studies with a total of 1993 randomised participants. Three studies enrolled participants with peripheral vascular disease and two studies included participants with coronary artery disease, one of which specifically recruited people who had had a myocardial infarction. The number of participants in each study varied widely (from 10 to 1708 participants), but all studies compared EDTA chelation to a placebo. Risk of bias for the included studies was generally moderate to low, but one study had high risk of bias because the study investigators broke their randomisation code halfway through the study and rolled the placebo participants over to active treatment. Certainty of the evidence, as assessed by GRADE, was generally low to very low, which was mostly due to a paucity of data in each outcome's meta-analysis. This limited our ability to draw any strong conclusions. We also had concerns about one study's risk of bias regarding blinding and outcome assessment that may have biased the results. Two studies with coronary artery disease participants reported no evidence of a difference in all-cause mortality between chelation therapy and placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.97, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.28; 1792 participants; low-certainty). One study with coronary artery disease participants reported no evidence of a difference in coronary heart disease deaths between chelation therapy and placebo (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.48; 1708 participants; very low-certainty). Two studies with coronary artery disease participants reported no evidence of a difference in myocardial infarction (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.14; 1792 participants; moderate-certainty), angina (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.67; 1792 participants; very low-certainty), and coronary revascularisation (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.07 to 3.25; 1792 participants). Two studies (one with coronary artery disease participants and one with peripheral vascular disease participants) reported no evidence of a difference in stroke (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.92; 1867 participants; low-certainty). Ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI; also known as ankle brachial index) was measured in three studies, all including participants with peripheral vascular disease; two studies found no evidence of a difference in the treatment groups after three months after treatment (mean difference (MD) 0.02, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.06; 181 participants; low-certainty). A third study reported an improvement in ABPI in the EDTA chelation group, but this study was at high risk of bias. Meta-analysis of maximum and pain-free walking distances three months after treatment included participants with peripheral vascular disease and showed no evidence of a difference between the treatment groups (MD -31.46, 95% CI -87.63 to 24.71; 165 participants; 2 studies; low-certainty). Quality of life outcomes were reported by two studies that included participants with coronary artery disease, but we were unable to pool the data due to different methods of reporting and varied criteria. However, there did not appear to be any major differences between the treatment groups. None of the included studies reported on vascular deaths. Overall, there was no evidence of major or minor adverse events associated with EDTA chelation treatment.
There is currently insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of chelation therapy in improving clinical outcomes of people with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. More high-quality, randomised controlled trials are needed that assess the effects of chelation therapy on longevity and quality of life among people with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.","Atherosclerosis is caused by fatty deposits that cause a narrowing of people's arteries and restrict blood flow. People with blocked arteries are more likely to have strokes, heart attacks, and narrow blood vessels in their feet. Chelation therapy involves infusions into the bloodstream of substances believed to remove metals from the blood. This treatment is offered to people with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease as a way of breaking down the blockages in their blood vessels. Chelation therapy is practiced in several places around the world as an alternative form of medicine, but there is currently a lack of knowledge surrounding this treatment. More information is needed to understand if this treatment should be more widely recommended.
We considered most of the data we found to be of low certainty, mostly because there were very few studies that provided data. Even though we included five studies, not all of them reported on each outcome. There is currently not enough evidence about the effects of chelation therapy on blockages in the blood vessels of people with atherosclerotic cardiovascular (heart and circulation) disease.
Overall, this review did not find any clear differences between people treated with chelation and people given the control, for the outcomes we evaluated. None of the outcomes included more than two studies, therefore it is difficult at this time to determine if these are true findings or just because there is not enough data. Further high-quality trials that focus on clinical outcomes are necessary.",1043,"Chelation therapy, EDTA chelation therapy, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, placebo, randomised controlled trials, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, myocardial infarction, risk of bias, meta-analysis",What was the study specifically trying to assess about EDTA chelation therapy in participants with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease?,What methods did the study use to evaluate the effects of EDTA chelation therapy versus placebo or no treatment?,What were the key findings regarding the effectiveness and safety of EDTA chelation therapy compared to placebo or no treatment in the study?
zhiweny2@illinois.edu,finetuned_6,What are the benefits and risks of eye drops that widen the pupil as an additional treatment for inflammation after a blow to the eye?,"Traumatic eye complaints account for 3% of all hospital emergency department visits. The most common traumatic injury to the eye is blunt trauma, which accounts for 30% of these visits. Blunt trauma frequently leads to traumatic iridocyclitis, thus causing anterior uveitis. Iridocyclitis frequently causes tearing, photophobia, eye pain, and vision loss. These symptoms are a result of the inflammatory processes and ciliary spasms to iris muscles and sphincter. The inflammatory process is usually managed with topical corticosteroids, while the ciliary spasm is blunted by dilating the pupils with topical mydriatic agents, an adjuvant therapy. However, the effectiveness of mydriatic agents has not been quantified in terms of reduction of ocular pain and visual acuity loss.
To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of topical mydriatics as adjunctive therapy to topical corticosteroids for traumatic iridocyclitis.
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register (2019, issue 6); Ovid MEDLINE; Embase.com; Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) Plus; PubMed; ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic search for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 12 June 2019.
We planned to include randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared topical mydriatic agents in conjunction with topical corticosteroid therapy versus topical corticosteroids alone, in participants with traumatic iridocyclitis.
Two review authors (JH, MK) independently screened titles and abstracts, then full-text reports, against eligibility criteria. We planned to have two authors independently extract data from included studies. We resolved differences in opinion by discussion.
There were no eligible RCTs that compared the interventions of interest in people with traumatic iridocyclitis.
We did not find any evidence from RCTs about the efficacy of topical mydriatic agents as an adjunctive therapy with topical corticosteroids for treating traumatic iridocyclitis. In the absence of these types of studies, we cannot draw any firm conclusions. Controlled trials that compare the combined use of topical mydriatic agents and corticosteroid drops against standard corticosteroid drops alone, in people with traumatic iridocyclitis are required. These may provide evidence about the efficacy and risk of topical mydriatic drops as adjuvant therapy for traumatic iridocyclitis.","Hospital emergency departments often treat people with eye injuries. There are two main types of eye injuries: blunt trauma injuries, when an object or force strikes the eye, commonly caused by motor vehicle accidents, sports- or work-related accidents, or fights; and penetrating trauma injuries, when a sharp object or an object traveling at high speed (for example, pellets from air-powered guns) pierces the eye. Blunt trauma is the more common type of injury. People who experience these injuries often develop traumatic iridocyclitis, an inflammation of the iris (the colored part of the eye surrounding the pupil) and the ciliary body (the muscles and tissues around the iris). Traumatic iridocyclitis can develop after both major and minor blunt trauma and can affect both children and adults. Symptoms include eye pain and sensitivity to light. If the inflammation is missed or not treated properly, it can lead to vision loss. The standard treatment for traumatic iridocyclitis is anti-inflammatory eye drops (corticosteroids). Eye drops that widen the pupil (mydriatics) are often added to reduce pain and discomfort and to shorten the duration of symptoms. We aimed to determine whether using mydriatics alongside corticosteroids is more beneficial or causes more unwanted effects than using corticosteroids alone. Specifically, we wanted to know if mydriatics relieve pain and inflammation and improve vision, and whether they cause complications such as chronic pain or serious harm to vision, including blindness. Our team searched the medical literature for randomized controlled trials�the most reliable type of study�on people of any age with traumatic iridocyclitis that compared mydriatics plus corticosteroids against corticosteroids alone. We found no randomized controlled trials addressing this question. Therefore, we do not know whether adding mydriatics to corticosteroids is helpful or harmful compared with corticosteroids alone. More research is needed, including well-designed trials, to understand the benefits and risks of using mydriatics as an additional treatment for traumatic iridocyclitis.",1053,"traumatic iridocyclitis, topical mydriatic agents, topical corticosteroids, blunt trauma, anterior uveitis, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), inflammatory processes, ocular pain, visual acuity loss, ciliary spasm",What was the study trying to examine regarding the use of topical mydriatics in traumatic iridocyclitis?,What methods were used in the study to identify relevant trials and data?,What results were found in the study concerning the efficacy of topical mydriatic agents as an adjunctive therapy?
zhiweny2@illinois.edu,finetuned_6,Aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for the prevention of dementia,"Dementia is a worldwide concern. Its global prevalence is increasing. At present, there is no medication licensed to prevent or delay the onset of dementia. Inflammation has been suggested as a key factor in dementia pathogenesis. Therefore, medications with anti-inflammatory properties could be beneficial for dementia prevention. To evaluate the effectiveness and adverse effects of aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for the primary or secondary prevention of dementia. We searched ALOIS, the specialised register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group up to 9 January 2020. ALOIS contains records of clinical trials identified from monthly searches of several major healthcare databases, trial registries and grey literature sources. We ran additional searches across MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP) and six other databases to ensure that the searches were as comprehensive and up-to-date as possible. We also reviewed citations of reference lists of included studies. We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) comparing aspirin or other NSAIDs with placebo for the primary or secondary prevention of dementia. We included trials with cognitively healthy participants (primary prevention) or participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or cognitive complaints (secondary prevention). We used standard methodological procedures according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We rated the strength of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach. We included four RCTs with 23,187 participants. Because of the diversity of these trials, we did not combine data to give summary estimates, but presented a narrative description of the evidence. We identified one trial (19,114 participants) comparing low-dose aspirin (100 mg once daily) to placebo. Participants were aged 70 years or older with no history of dementia, cardiovascular disease or physical disability. Interim analysis indicated no significant treatment effect and the trial was terminated slightly early after a median of 4.7 years' follow-up. There was no evidence of a difference in incidence of dementia between aspirin and placebo groups (risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.15; high-certainty evidence). Participants allocated aspirin had higher rates of major bleeding (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.60, high-certainty evidence) and slightly higher mortality (RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.28; high-certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in activities of daily living between groups (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.02; high-certainty evidence). We identified three trials comparing non-aspirin NSAIDs to placebo. All three trials were terminated early due to adverse events associated with NSAIDs reported in other trials. One trial (2528 participants) investigated the cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor celecoxib (200 mg twice daily) and the non-selective NSAID naproxen (220 mg twice daily) for preventing dementia in cognitively healthy older adults with a family history of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Median follow-up was 734 days. Combining both NSAID treatment arms, there was no evidence of a difference in the incidence of AD between participants allocated NSAIDs and those allocated placebo (RR 1.91, 95% CI 0.89 to 4.10; moderate-certainty evidence). There was also no evidence of a difference in rates of myocardial infarction (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.61 to 2.40), stroke (RR 1.82, 95% CI 0.76 to 4.37) or mortality (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.43) between treatment groups (all moderate-certainty evidence). One trial (88 participants) assessed the effectiveness of celecoxib (200 mg or 400 mg daily) in delaying cognitive decline in participants aged 40 to 81 years with mild age-related memory loss but normal memory performance scores. Mean duration of follow-up was 17.6 months in the celecoxib group and 18.1 months in the placebo group. There was no evidence of a difference between groups in test scores in any of six cognitive domains. Participants allocated celecoxib experienced more gastrointestinal adverse events than those allocated placebo (RR 2.66, 95% CI 1.05 to 6.75; low-certainty evidence). One trial (1457 participants) assessed the effectiveness of the COX-2 inhibitor rofecoxib (25 mg once daily) in delaying or preventing a diagnosis of AD in participants with MCI. Median duration of study participation was 115 weeks in the rofecoxib group and 130 weeks in the placebo group. There was a higher incidence of AD in the rofecoxib than the placebo group (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.72; moderate-certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between groups in cardiovascular adverse events (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.66; moderate-certainty evidence) or mortality (RR 1.62, 95% CI 0.85 to 3.05; moderate-certainty evidence). Participants allocated rofecoxib had more upper gastrointestinal adverse events (RR 3.53, 95% CI 1.17 to 10.68; moderate-certainty evidence). Reported annual mean difference scores showed no evidence of a difference between groups in activities of daily living (year 1: no data available; year 2: 0.0, 95% CI �0.1 to 0.2; year 3: 0.1, 95% CI �0.1 to 0.3; year 4: 0.1, 95% CI �0.1 to 0.4; moderate-certainty evidence). There is no evidence to support the use of low-dose aspirin or other NSAIDs of any class (celecoxib, rofecoxib or naproxen) for the prevention of dementia, but there was evidence of harm. Although there were limitations in the available evidence, it seems unlikely that there is any need for further trials of low-dose aspirin for dementia prevention. If future studies of NSAIDs for dementia prevention are planned, they will need to be cognisant of the safety concerns arising from the existing studies.","Dementia is a worldwide healthcare concern. At present, there is no medicine that is proven to delay or prevent the onset of dementia. The biology of dementia is still poorly understood. However, there are reasons to believe that inflammation may be partly responsible for some of the brain changes seen in dementia. There are many medicines that have anti-inflammatory properties, including aspirin and NSAIDs that are often sold as pain killers. We wanted to see if these medicines had any effect on developing dementia. These medicines have a few potential side effects, including heart attack and bleeding, so we also assessed for any harmful effects of the medicines. We searched for relevant studies that had been published up to January 2020. We found four trials that met the inclusion criteria for this review (23,187 people). One trial was undertaken in the USA and Australia and three in the USA only. The trials included different populations. One was of aspirin in healthy people with no history of dementia, cardiovascular disease or physical disability. The other three were of NSAIDs other than aspirin and were conducted in healthy people with a family history of Alzheimer's disease, people with self-reported memory loss and people with mild cognitive impairment (a slight but noticeable and measurable decline in cognitive abilities, including memory and thinking skills). All of the included studies had limitations. The study of aspirin was stopped early due to ineffectiveness. The three studies of other NSAIDs (celecoxib, naproxen and rofecoxib) were stopped early due to concerns around the safety. This review found no evidence to support the use of either aspirin or other NSAIDs for the prevention of dementia and, in fact, there was some suggestion that they may cause harm. The studies had limitations, but, given the concerns over safety, further studies of low-dose aspirin for dementia prevention seem unlikely. If future studies of NSAIDs for dementia prevention are planned, then these will need to be mindful of the safety concerns arising from the studies included in this review and from other studies of the same medicines.",1132,"Dementia, NSAIDs, aspirin, randomised controlled trials (RCTs), Alzheimer's disease (AD), cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, cognitive impairment, inflammation, placebo, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)",What was the main objective of evaluating the effectiveness and adverse effects of aspirin and other NSAIDs?,What methodological procedures and databases were used to gather data for the trials included in the study?,"What were the findings regarding the use of low-dose aspirin and NSAIDs like celecoxib, rofecoxib, and naproxen for the prevention of dementia?"
bl61,static_1,What are the benefits and risks of vaccines for preventing COVID-19?,"Different forms of vaccines have been developed to prevent the SARS-CoV-2 virus and subsequent COVID-19 disease, and several are in widespread global use. The objective was to assess the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines, whether as a full primary series or booster dose, against SARS-CoV-2. We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and the COVID-19 L�OVE platform (last search 5 November 2021), as well as the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, regulatory agency websites, and Retraction Watch. We included randomized controlled trials comparing COVID-19 vaccines with placebo, no vaccine, other active vaccines, or other vaccine schedules. Using standard Cochrane methods and GRADE for all outcomes except immunogenicity, we synthesized data for each vaccine separately and presented summary effect estimates with 95% confidence intervals. We included 41 RCTs assessing 12 vaccines, including homologous and heterologous schedules and booster doses; 32 were multicentre and five were multinational, with sample sizes ranging from 60 to 44,325 participants. Participants were aged 18 years or older in 36 RCTs, 12 years or older in one, 12�17 years in two, and 3�17 years in two; 29 trials included people over 60, three included immunocompromized patients, and none included pregnant women. Follow-up was ? two months in 16 RCTs, two to six months in 20, and > six to 12 months in five; 18 were preplanned interim analyses. Overall risk of bias was low for all outcomes in eight RCTs, while 33 had concerns for at least one outcome. We identified 343 registered RCTs with unavailable results. This abstract reports results for symptomatic COVID-19, severe/critical COVID-19, and serious adverse events for the 10 WHO-approved vaccines. Evidence for mortality was sparse and low or very low certainty for all vaccines except AD26.COV2.S (Janssen), which probably reduces all-cause mortality (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.67; 1 RCT, 43,783 participants; high-certainty evidence). High-certainty evidence shows that BNT162b2 (Pfizer), mRNA-1273 (Moderna), ChAdOx1 (AstraZeneca), Ad26.COV2.S, BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm-Beijing), and BBV152 (Bharat Biotech) reduce symptomatic COVID-19 compared with placebo, with vaccine efficacy ranging from about 66% to over 97% based on multiple trials. Moderate-certainty evidence shows that NVX-CoV2373 (Novavax) probably reduces symptomatic infection, while CoronaVac (Sinovac) has low-certainty evidence due to heterogeneity between its two trials. For severe or critical COVID-19, high-certainty evidence indicates that BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, Ad26.COV2.S, and BBV152 produce large reductions in severe disease, with efficacy estimates ranging from about 76% to over 98%; NVX-CoV2373 probably reduces severe disease; and two CoronaVac trials reported high efficacy but could not be pooled. For serious adverse events, mRNA-1273, ChAdOx1/SII-ChAdOx1, Ad26.COV2.S, and BBV152 probably result in little or no difference compared with placebo (RRs ranging from 0.65 to 0.92), with absolute differences fewer than 5 per 1000 participants. Evidence for SAEs is uncertain for BNT162b2, CoronaVac, BBIBP-CorV, and NVX-CoV2373 due to wide confidence intervals and low event counts. For heterologous schedules, boosters, and variant-specific efficacy, see the full review. Compared with placebo, most vaccines reduce or likely reduce symptomatic COVID-19, and several show high-certainty reductions in severe or critical disease, with probably little or no difference in serious adverse events. Over 300 registered RCTs continue to evaluate COVID-19 vaccines, and this review is regularly updated on the COVID-NMA platform. Due to trial exclusions, results cannot be generalized to pregnant women, individuals with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, or immunocompromized people; most trials had short follow-up and occurred before variants of concern emerged. Future research should evaluate long-term effects, compare vaccines and schedules, assess efficacy and safety in specific populations, include outcomes such as preventing long COVID-19, and continually monitor protection against emerging variants.","SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) is the virus that causes COVID-19 disease, and not everyone infected will develop symptoms, which can range from mild (such as fever and headaches) to life-threatening (such as difficulty breathing), or death. While vaccines work slightly differently, they all prepare the body's immune system to prevent people from getting infected with SARS-CoV-2 or, if they do get infected, to prevent severe disease. We wanted to find out how well each vaccine works in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection, symptomatic COVID-19, severe COVID-19 disease, and total deaths (including any cause), as well as serious adverse events requiring hospitalization or being life-threatening, systemic reactogenicity events (short-term immunological reactions like fever, headache, body aches, and fatigue), and any adverse events including non-serious ones. We searched for studies examining any COVID-19 vaccine compared with placebo, no vaccine, or another COVID-19 vaccine, selecting only randomized trials that evaluate interventions under ideal conditions among participants assigned by chance to different groups, and we summarized results and rated our confidence in the evidence based on study conduct. We found 41 worldwide studies involving 433,838 people assessing 12 vaccines; 35 included only healthy people who had never had COVID-19, 36 included only adults, two only adolescents, two children and adolescents, and one adolescents and adults; three involved people with weakened immune systems, and none involved pregnant women. Most studies assessed results less than six months after primary vaccination, most received co-funding from academic institutions and pharmaceutical companies, most compared a COVID-19 vaccine with placebo, and five evaluated a 'mix and match' booster. We report results for three main outcomes and for 10 WHO-approved vaccines: there is insufficient evidence regarding deaths between vaccines and placebo except for the Janssen vaccine, which probably reduces all-cause deaths. The Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Sinopharm-Beijing, and Bharat vaccines produce a large reduction in symptomatic COVID-19, Janssen reduces symptomatic cases, Novavax probably produces a large reduction, and CoronaVac has insufficient evidence because results differed between its two studies. For severe disease, Pfizer, Moderna, Janssen, and Bharat produce a large reduction, while evidence for CoronaVac is insufficient due to differing study results. For serious adverse events, Pfizer, CoronaVac, Sinopharm-Beijing, and Novavax have insufficient evidence due to low numbers of events, while Moderna, AstraZeneca, Janssen, and Bharat probably result in no or little difference in serious adverse events. Most studies assessed vaccines for a short time after injection, making it unclear how protection wanes over time; exclusion criteria limit generalizability to pregnant women, people with prior infection, and those with weakened immune systems; more research is needed comparing vaccines, schedules, effectiveness, and safety in specific populations and outcomes such as preventing long COVID-19; and most studies were conducted before variants of concern emerged.",1110,"COVID-19 vaccines, randomized controlled trials, SARS-CoV-2, symptomatic COVID-19, severe/critical COVID-19, serious adverse events, WHO-approved vaccines, vaccine efficacy, high-certainty evidence, moderate-certainty evidence",What was the objective of the study regarding COVID-19 vaccines?,What methods were used in the study to assess vaccine efficacy and safety?,What were the key results found regarding vaccine efficacy and safety against symptomatic and severe COVID-19?
bl61,static_1,Selenium for preventing cancer,"This review is the third update of the Cochrane review ""Selenium for preventing cancer"". Selenium is a naturally occurring element with both nutritional and toxicological properties. Higher selenium exposure and selenium supplements have been suggested to protect against several types of cancer.
To gather and present evidence needed to address two research questions: 1. What is the aetiological relationship between selenium exposure and cancer risk in humans?2. Describe the efficacy of selenium supplementation for cancer prevention in humans.
We updated electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 2), MEDLINE (Ovid, 2013 to January 2017, week 4), and Embase (2013 to 2017, week 6), as well as searches of clinical trial registries.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and longitudinal observational studies that enrolled adult participants.
We performed random-effects (RE) meta-analyses when two or more RCTs were available for a specific outcome. We conducted RE meta-analyses when five or more observational studies were available for a specific outcome. We assessed risk of bias in RCTs and in observational studies using Cochrane's risk assessment tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, respectively. We considered in the primary analysis data pooled from RCTs with low risk of bias. We assessed the certainty of evidence by using the GRADE approach.
We included 83 studies in this updated review: two additional RCTs (10 in total) and a few additional trial reports for previously included studies. RCTs involved 27,232 participants allocated to either selenium supplements or placebo. For analyses of RCTs with low risk of bias, the summary risk ratio (RR) for any cancer incidence was 1.01 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.10; 3 studies, 19,475 participants; high-certainty evidence). The RR for estimated cancer mortality was 1.02 (95% CI 0.80 to 1.30; 1 study, 17,448 participants). For the most frequently investigated site-specific cancers, investigators provided little evidence of any effect of selenium supplementation. Two RCTs with 19,009 participants indicated that colorectal cancer was unaffected by selenium administration (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.43), as were non-melanoma skin cancer (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.30 to 4.42; 2 studies, 2027 participants), lung cancer (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.50; 2 studies, 19,009 participants), breast cancer (RR 2.04, 95% CI 0.44 to 9.55; 1 study, 802 participants), bladder cancer (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.52; 2 studies, 19,009 participants), and prostate cancer (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.14; 4 studies, 18,942 participants). Certainty of the evidence was high for all of these cancer sites, except for breast cancer, which was of moderate certainty owing to imprecision, and non-melanoma skin cancer, which we judged as moderate certainty owing to high heterogeneity. RCTs with low risk of bias suggested increased melanoma risk. Results for most outcomes were similar when we included all RCTs in the meta-analysis, regardless of risk of bias. Selenium supplementation did not reduce overall cancer incidence (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.14; 5 studies, 21,860 participants) nor mortality (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.32; 2 studies, 18,698 participants). Summary RRs for site-specific cancers showed limited changes compared with estimates from high-quality studies alone, except for liver cancer, for which results were reversed. In the largest trial, the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Trial, selenium supplementation increased risks of alopecia and dermatitis, and for participants with highest background selenium status, supplementation also increased risk of high-grade prostate cancer. RCTs showed a slightly increased risk of type 2 diabetes associated with supplementation. A hypothesis generated by the Nutritional Prevention of Cancer Trial - that individuals with low blood selenium levels could reduce their risk of cancer (particularly prostate cancer) by increasing selenium intake - has not been confirmed. As RCT participants have been overwhelmingly male (88%), we could not assess the potential influence of sex or gender. We included 15 additional observational cohort studies (70 in total; over 2,360,000 participants). We found that lower cancer incidence (summary odds ratio (OR) 0.72, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.93; 7 studies, 76,239 participants) and lower cancer mortality (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.97; 7 studies, 183,863 participants) were associated with the highest category of selenium exposure compared with the lowest. Cancer incidence was lower in men (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.14, 4 studies, 29,365 men) than in women (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.77, 2 studies, 18,244 women). Data show a decrease in risk of site-specific cancers for stomach, colorectal, lung, breast, bladder, and prostate cancers. However, these studies have major weaknesses due to study design, exposure misclassification, and potential unmeasured confounding due to lifestyle or nutritional factors covarying with selenium exposure beyond those taken into account in multi-variable analyses. In addition, no evidence of a dose-response relation between selenium status and cancer risk emerged. Certainty of evidence was very low for each outcome. Some studies suggested that genetic factors might modify the relation between selenium and cancer risk - an issue that merits further investigation.
Well-designed and well-conducted RCTs have shown no beneficial effect of selenium supplements in reducing cancer risk (high certainty of evidence). Some RCTs have raised concerns by reporting a higher incidence of high-grade prostate cancer and type 2 diabetes in participants with selenium supplementation. No clear evidence of an influence of baseline participant selenium status on outcomes has emerged in these studies. Observational longitudinal studies have shown an inverse association between selenium exposure and risk of some cancer types, but null and direct relations have also been reported, and no systematic pattern suggesting dose-response relations has emerged. These studies suffer from limitations inherent to the observational design, including exposure misclassification and unmeasured confounding. Overall, there is no evidence to suggest that increasing selenium intake through diet or supplementation prevents cancer in humans. However, more research is needed to assess whether selenium may modify the risk of cancer in individuals with a specific genetic background or nutritional status, and to investigate possible differential effects of various forms of selenium.","We reviewed the evidence investigating the relation between selenium intake and cancer prevention. This review updates the most recent Cochrane review on this topic (Vinceti 2014, which was an update of Dennert 2011.
Selenium is a naturally occurring element that individuals are exposed to mainly through food consumption, although exposure can also occur through air, drinking water, and dietary supplements. Small amounts of selenium are essential for certain biological functions in humans, but slightly higher amounts can pose a toxicity risk, making selenium an element with a narrow, but as yet not well-defined, safe range of exposure. Selenium occurs in many different chemical forms with different biological activity. From the late 1960s, a few observational studies reported that people with high levels of selenium in their diet or in their body tissues had lower risk of cancer, and some laboratory studies showed that selenium could inhibit the growth of cancer cells. This led to widespread interest in selenium supplements and claims that taking such supplements could prevent cancer. Since that time, many more observational studies have been conducted to compare cancer rates among individuals with high and low selenium exposure. More recently, several randomised controlled trials designed to assess whether selenium supplementation can prevent cancer have been carried out. These trials played a major role in enhancing our understanding of the relation between selenium and cancer risk as a result of their stronger study design as compared with observational studies. The most recent trials in particular have shown high methodological quality and statistical power. Several trials focused on whether selenium could prevent prostate cancer.
This review includes 10 trials in which adults were randomly assigned to receive selenium supplements or placebo, and 70 observational studies in which adults were followed over time to determine whether their baseline selenium status was associated with their risk of cancer. The evidence is current to January 2017.
All of the high-quality randomised trials reported no effect of selenium on reducing overall risk of cancer or risk of particular cancers, including the most investigated outcome - prostate cancer. Some trials unexpectedly suggested that selenium may increase risks of high-grade prostate cancer, type 2 diabetes, and dermatological abnormalities.
Observational studies have yielded inconsistent evidence of a possible effect of selenium exposure on cancer risk, with no evidence of a dose-response relation. When we pooled results of these studies, overall they suggested an inverse relation between cancer exposure and subsequent incidence of any cancer or some specific cancers, such as colon and prostate cancer. However, observational studies have major weaknesses. The selenium exposure status of participants could have been misclassified owing to limitations of the indicators of selenium exposure used, as well as to uncertainty regarding the particular selenium species contributing to overall exposure. In addition, unmeasured confounding from lifestyle or nutritional factors - a major and well-known source of bias in nutritional epidemiology studies of observational design - could have been present. Therefore, the internal validity of these studies is limited.
Currently, the hypothesis that increasing selenium intake may reduce cancer risk is not supported by epidemiological evidence. Additional research is needed to assess whether selenium may affect the risk of cancer in individuals with specific genetic backgrounds or nutritional status, and to determine how the various chemical forms of selenium compounds may have different effects on cancer risk.",1025,"Selenium supplementation, Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), Cancer risk, Observational studies, High-certainty evidence, Site-specific cancers, Cancer incidence, Cancer prevention, Meta-analyses, Genetic factors.",What were the main research questions this study aimed to examine regarding selenium and cancer?,What methods did the study use to gather and analyze data related to selenium's effects on cancer prevention?,What were the key findings about the efficacy of selenium supplementation in reducing cancer risk according to the study?
bl61,static_1,Melatonin and agomelatine for prevention of winter depression,"Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a seasonal pattern of recurrent major depressive episodes that most commonly starts in autumn or winter and remits in spring. The prevalence of SAD depends on latitude and ranges from 1.5% to 9%. The predictable seasonal aspect of SAD provides a promising opportunity for prevention in people who have a history of SAD. This is one of four reviews on the efficacy and safety of interventions to prevent SAD; we focus on agomelatine and melatonin as preventive interventions. To assess the efficacy and safety of agomelatine and melatonin (in comparison with each other, placebo, second-generation antidepressants, light therapy, psychological therapy or lifestyle interventions) in preventing SAD and improving person-centred outcomes among adults with a history of SAD. We searched Ovid MEDLINE (1950- ), Embase (1974- ), PsycINFO (1967- ) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to 19 June 2018. An earlier search of these databases was conducted via the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trial Register (CCMD-CTR) (all years to 11 August 2015). Furthermore, we searched the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database and international trial registers (to 19 June 2018). We also conducted a grey literature search and handsearched the reference lists of included studies and pertinent review articles. To examine efficacy, we included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on adults with a history of winter-type SAD who were free of symptoms at the beginning of the study. For adverse events, we intended also to include non-randomised studies. We planned to include studies that compared agomelatine versus melatonin, or agomelatine or melatonin versus placebo, any second-generation antidepressant, light therapy, psychological therapies or lifestyle changes. We also intended to compare melatonin or agomelatine in combination with any of the comparator interventions mentioned above versus the same comparator intervention as monotherapy.
Two review authors screened abstracts and full-text publications, abstracted data and assessed risk of bias of included studies independently. We intended to pool data in a meta-analysis using a random-effects model, but included only one study. We identified 3745 citations through electronic searches and reviews of reference lists after deduplication of search results. We excluded 3619 records during title and abstract review and assessed 126 full-text papers for inclusion in the review. Only one study, providing data of 225 participants, met our eligibility criteria and compared agomelatine (25 mg/day) with placebo. We rated it as having high risk of attrition bias because nearly half of the participants left the study before completion. We rated the certainty of the evidence as very low for all outcomes, because of high risk of bias, indirectness, and imprecision. The main analysis based on data of 199 participants rendered an indeterminate result with wide confidence intervals (CIs) that may encompass both a relevant reduction as well as a relevant increase of SAD incidence by agomelatine (risk ratio (RR) 0.83, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.34; 199 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Also the severity of SAD may be similar in both groups at the end of the study with a mean SIGH-SAD (Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Seasonal Affective Disorders) score of 8.3 (standard deviation (SD) 9.4) in the agomelatine group and 10.1 (SD 10.6) in the placebo group (mean difference (MD) -1.80, 95% CI -4.58 to 0.98; 199 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events may be similar in both groups. In the agomelatine group, 64 out of 112 participants experienced at least one adverse event, while 61 out of 113 did in the placebo group (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.34; 225 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Three out of 112 patients experienced serious adverse events in the agomelatine group, compared to 4 out of 113 in the placebo group (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.17 to 3.30; 225 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No data on quality of life or interpersonal functioning were reported. We did not identify any studies on melatonin.
Given the uncertain evidence on agomelatine and the absence of studies on melatonin, no conclusion about efficacy and safety of agomelatine and melatonin for prevention of SAD can currently be drawn. The decision for or against initiating preventive treatment of SAD and the treatment selected should consider patient preferences and reflect on the evidence base of all available treatment options.","Many people in northern latitudes suffer from seasonal affective disorder (SAD), which occurs as a reaction to reduced sunlight. Three-quarters of those affected are women. Lethargy, overeating, craving for carbohydrates and depressed mood are common symptoms. In some people, SAD becomes depression that seriously affects their daily lives. Up to two-thirds experience depressive symptoms every winter. General practitioners, psychiatrists, pharmacists, other health professionals working in adult mental health services, and researchers could be interested in the results of this review. Anyone who has experienced winter depression, or who has friends or relatives who have experienced winter depression might also be interested. Because of the seasonal pattern and high recurrence of SAD, melatonin or agomelatine could be used to prevent the onset of depressed mood. The goal of this report is to examine whether benefits outweigh harms of melatonin or agomelatine when used to prevent onset of a new depressive episode in people with a history of SAD who were free of symptoms when the preventive intervention started. To date, this question has not been examined in a systematic way. This is one of four reviews on the efficacy and potential harms of interventions to prevent SAD. We searched databases up to June 2018 for studies on melatonin or agomelatine for prevention of winter depression. Among 3745 records, we found one randomised controlled study comparing agomelatine with placebo for one year. All 225 participants had a history of winter depression but were not depressed when the prevention study started. The included study showed neither a clear effect in favour nor against agomelatine as a preventive treatment. In addition, the certainty of evidence for all outcomes was very low, making it impossible to draw any conclusions about the efficacy and safety of agomelatine for the prevention of winter depression. No evidence on melatonin for prevention of SAD was identified. Doctors need to discuss with persons with a history of SAD that currently evidence on agomelatine or melatonin for preventive treatment options for SAD is inconclusive, therefore treatment selection should be strongly based on peoples' preferences and reflect on the evidence base of all available treatment options. Review authors recommend that future studies should evaluate the efficacy of agomelatine or melatonin in preventing SAD and should directly compare these interventions against other treatment options, such as light therapy, antidepressants, or psychological therapies to determine the best treatment option for prevention of SAD.",1121,"Seasonal affective disorder, agomelatine, melatonin, risk of bias, randomised controlled trials, confidence intervals, placebo, adverse events, preventive interventions, meta-analysis",What were the researchers trying to examine in terms of agomelatine and melatonin for preventing SAD?,What method was primarily used in the study to gather evidence on the effectiveness of agomelatine and melatonin?,What were the main results found regarding the efficacy of agomelatine in preventing SAD?
bl61,static_1,First-line treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer identified as being EGFR mutation positive,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation positive (M+) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is an important subtype of lung cancer comprising 10% to 15% of non-squamous tumours. This subtype is more common in women than men, is less associated with smoking, but occurs at a younger age than sporadic tumours.
To assess the clinical effectiveness of single-agent or combination EGFR therapies used in the first-line treatment of people with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR M+ NSCLC compared with other cytotoxic chemotherapy (CTX) agents used alone or in combination, or best supportive care (BSC). The primary outcomes were overall survival and progression-free survival. Secondary outcomes included response rate, symptom palliation, toxicity, and health-related quality of life.
We conducted electronic searches of the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2020, Issue 7), MEDLINE (1946 to 27th July 2020), Embase (1980 to 27th July 2020), and ISI Web of Science (1899 to 27th July 2020). We also searched the conference abstracts of the American Society for Clinical Oncology and the European Society for Medical Oncology (July 2020); Evidence Review Group submissions to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence; and the reference lists of retrieved articles.
Parallel-group randomised controlled trials comparing EGFR-targeted agents (alone or in combination with cytotoxic agents or BSC) with cytotoxic chemotherapy (single or doublet) or BSC in chemotherapy-naive patients with locally advanced or metastatic (stage IIIB or IV) EGFR M+ NSCLC unsuitable for treatment with curative intent.
Two review authors independently identified articles, extracted data, and carried out the 'Risk of bias' assessment. We conducted meta-analyses using a fixed-effect model unless there was substantial heterogeneity, in which case we also performed a random-effects analysis as a sensitivity analysis.
Twenty-two trials met the inclusion criteria. Ten of these exclusively recruited people with EGFR M+ NSCLC; the remainder recruited a mixed population and reported results for people with EGFR M+ NSCLC as subgroup analyses. The number of participants with EGFR M+ tumours totalled 3023, of whom approximately 2563 were of Asian origin. Overall survival (OS) data showed inconsistent results between the included trials that compared EGFR-targeted treatments against cytotoxic chemotherapy or placebo. Erlotinib was used in eight trials, gefitinib in nine trials, afatinib in two trials, cetuximab in two trials, and icotinib in one trial. The findings of FASTACT 2 suggested a clinical benefit for OS for participants treated with erlotinib plus cytotoxic chemotherapy when compared to cytotoxic chemotherapy alone, as did the Han 2017 trial for gefitinib plus cytotoxic chemotherapy, but both results were based on a small number of participants (n = 97 and 122, respectively). For progression-free survival (PFS), a pooled analysis of four trials showed evidence of clinical benefit for erlotinib compared with cytotoxic chemotherapy (hazard ratio (HR) 0.31; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25 to 0.39 ; 583 participants ; high-certainty evidence). A pooled analysis of two trials of gefitinib versus paclitaxel plus carboplatin showed evidence of clinical benefit for PFS for gefitinib (HR 0.39; 95% CI 0.32 to 0.48 ; 491 participants high-certainty evidence), and a pooled analysis of two trials of gefitinib versus pemetrexed plus carboplatin with pemetrexed maintenance also showed evidence of clinical benefit for PFS for gefitinib (HR 0.59; 95% CI 0.46 to 0.74, 371 participants ; moderate-certainty evidence). Afatinib showed evidence of clinical benefit for PFS when compared with chemotherapy in a pooled analysis of two trials (HR 0.42; 95% CI 0.34 to 0.53, 709 participants high-certainty evidence). All but one small trial showed a corresponding improvement in response rate with tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) compared to chemotherapy. Commonly reported grade 3/4 adverse events associated with afatinib, erlotinib, gefitinib and icotinib monotherapy were rash and diarrhoea. Myelosuppression was consistently worse in the chemotherapy arms; fatigue and anorexia were also associated with some chemotherapies. Seven trials reported on health-related quality of life and symptom improvement using different methodologies. For each of erlotinib, gefitinib, and afatinib, two trials showed improvement in one or more indices for the TKI compared to chemotherapy. The quality of evidence was high for the comparisons of erlotinib and gefitinib with cytotoxic chemotherapy and for the comparison of afatinib with cytotoxic chemotherapy.
Erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib and icotinib are all active agents in EGFR M+ NSCLC patients, and demonstrate an increased tumour response rate and prolonged PFS compared to cytotoxic chemotherapy. We found a beneficial effect of the TKI compared to cytotoxic chemotherapy in adverse effect and health-related quality of life. We found limited evidence for increased OS for the TKI when compared with standard chemotherapy, but the majority of the included trials allowed participants to switch treatments on disease progression, which will have a confounding effect on any OS analysis. Single agent-TKI remains the standard of care and the benefit of combining a TKI and chemotherapy remains uncertain as the evidence is based on small patient numbers. Cytotoxic chemotherapy is less effective in EGFR M+ NSCLC than erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib or icotinib and is associated with greater toxicity. There are no data supporting the use of monoclonal antibody therapy. Icotinib is not available outside China.","Lung cancer is the most common cancer in the world. It has often spread by the time it is diagnosed. Therefore, surgery is usually not possible and drug treatment, typically chemotherapy, is needed. The commonest type of lung cancer is non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Around 10% to 15% of people with NSCLC will have a specific kind of cancer known as epidermal growth factor receptor positive (EGFR M+), in which there are changes in the cancer cells to the genes controlling tumour growth. In this review, we looked at new treatments that can target EGFR M+ NSCLC to find out how well they work.
The purpose of this review was to find out whether people given treatments targeted at EGFR M+ NSCLC live longer and have a better health-related quality of life than people having standard chemotherapy.
We found 22 trials that looked at five different EGFR-targeted drugs and compared them with standard chemotherapy treatment: erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib, icotinib and the antibody cetuximab. We included trials reporting results up to 27 July 2020.
Our results showed that people given erlotinib, gefitinib,afatinib or icotinib have a longer time before the cancer progresses and experience fewer side effects than those people given standard chemotherapy. However, we could not be sure whether people given erlotinib, afatinib or icotinib live any longer than those given standard chemotherapy.
Erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib and icotinib delay further spread of EGFR M+ lung cancer and improve health-related quality of life. Giving cetuximab with chemotherapy is no better at controlling this type of cancer or extending life than chemotherapy alone.",1020,"EGFR-targeted agents, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI), progression-free survival (PFS), cytotoxic chemotherapy, overall survival (OS), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib",What was the study trying to examine in patients with EGFR mutation positive non-small cell lung cancer?,What methods were used to conduct the trials and analyses in the study?,What were the key results found regarding progression-free survival and overall survival in the study?
bl61,static_2,Does yoga relieve cancer-related fatigue in people with cancer?,"Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is one of the most prevalent symptoms in individuals with cancer. Various types of exercise have shown beneficial effects. While previous systematic reviews suggest exercise may improve CRF and quality of life, evidence specifically about yoga's impact, as well as evidence on long-term effects, is limited. Previous syntheses offer promising but inconclusive findings on yoga’s effectiveness. This review is one of a suite of five reviews exploring exercise for cancer-related fatigue.
To assess the effects of yoga versus no yoga on cancer-related fatigue in people with cancer: • before, during, and after anticancer treatment;• in the short, medium, and long term;• and effects on quality of life (QoL), adverse events, depression, and anxiety.
We used CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, five other databases and two trials registers, together with reference checking, citation searching and contact with study authors to identify studies that are included in the review. The latest search date was October 2023.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing yoga to no yoga. We included studies in adults (aged 18 and older) with any type of cancer and anticancer therapy who received yoga before, during, or after anticancer therapy. We included trials evaluating at least one of the main outcomes (CRF or QoL). Yoga had to last for at least five sessions, and involve face-to-face instruction. We excluded trials with fewer than 20 participants randomised per group.
The outcomes of interest in this review are cancer-related fatigue (CRF), quality of life (QoL), adverse events, depression, and anxiety. We used standard methods expected by Cochrane. For analyses, we pooled results within the same period of outcome assessment (i.e. short, medium, and long term), and employed a random-effects model. We assessed risk of bias with the Cochrane risk of bias (RoB) 1 tool, and used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence.
We included 21 RCTs with 2041 people with cancer who received yoga during (13 studies) or after (eight studies) anticancer therapy; none examined yoga initiated before therapy. Here we present results on CRF and QoL; findings on adverse events, depression, and anxiety are in the full review. Yoga during anticancer therapy The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of yoga compared to no yoga on: short-term CRF (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.18 to 0.32; mean difference (MD) on Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI; lower values mean better outcome) of 0.16, 95% CI -0.41 to 0.71; 3 studies, 253 participants); medium-term CRF (MD on Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI; lower values mean better outcome) of -1.30, 95% CI -3.50 to 0.90; 1 study, 67 participants); and long-term CRF (MD 0.09 on BFI, 95% CI 1.16 to 0.98; 2 studies, 155 participants) (all very low-certainty evidence). Yoga may have a small beneficial effect or no effect compared to no yoga on short-term QoL (SMD 0.25, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.45; MD on Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30 (QLQ-C30; higher values mean better outcome) of 5.28, 95% CI 0.84 to 9.56; 4 studies, 374 participants) and medium-term QoL (MD on QLQ-C30 of 7.63, 95% CI 6.71 to 21.97; 2 studies, 151 participants), but the evidence is very uncertain (all very low-certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported long-term QoL. Yoga after anticancer therapy Yoga probably has a beneficial effect compared to no yoga on short-term CRF (SMD -0.26, 95% CI -0.42 to -0.09; MD 2.55, 95% CI 0.88 to 4.12; higher values mean better outcome; 5 studies, 602 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Yoga might have a beneficial effect or no effect compared to no yoga on medium-term CRF, but the evidence is very uncertain (MD 3.02, 95% CI -1.48 to 7.52; 1 study, 54 participants (higher values mean better outcome; very low-certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported long-term CRF. Yoga may have a small beneficial effect or no effect compared to no yoga on short-term QoL (SMD 0.19, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.47; MD -3.27, 95% CI -8.08 to 1.55; higher values mean better outcome; 4 studies, 275 participants) and medium term QoL (MD 7.06, 95% CI -1.38 to 15.50; 1 study, 54 participants; higher values mean better outcome), but the evidence is very uncertain (all very low-certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported long-term QoL. A key limitation of the review was the included studies' methodological constraints: participants' awareness of treatment assignments (yoga or control) potentially introduced bias. Additionally, sample sizes were too small to determine medium- and long-term effects conclusively. Further research is needed to evaluate the sustainability of yoga's impact on cancer-related fatigue, quality of life, and adverse events.
Our review provides uncertain evidence of the beneficial effects of yoga initiated during or after anticancer therapy compared to no yoga for people with cancer. Although there are indications supporting the use of yoga to address CRF, the uncertainty of the evidence underscores the need for caution in its implementation. Future RCTs should employ rigorous methodologies, enrol sufficient participants, and use appropriate controls.","Cancer-related fatigue is a feeling of extreme tiredness that lasts for a long time. It can be caused by cancer, cancer therapy, or both. Cancer-related fatigue affects the body and mood and makes it hard to perform regular activities. It is stronger than just being tired and does not go away by resting. Clinical guidelines recommend physical exercise to improve cancer-related fatigue. Physical exercise affects cancer-related fatigue by influencing biological and psychological processes, but it is unclear what types of exercise may be most beneficial. Yoga may reduce cancer-related fatigue and improve quality of life because it combines physical movement with breath control, mental focus, and body awareness. This review explored whether yoga improves cancer-related fatigue and quality of life in adults. We also examined whether any adverse events occurred in the studies. We investigated short-term (up to 12 weeks), medium-term (12 weeks to 6 months), and long-term (more than 6 months) effects. We searched for studies comparing yoga with no yoga in adults with any cancer, including yoga done before, during, or after anticancer therapy. Multiple types of yoga were included, such as Hatha and Dru yoga. We compared and summarised the results, assessed study quality, and considered differences based on type of yoga, cancer type, format of exercise (group vs individual; supervised vs unsupervised), and participant age. We found 21 studies involving 2041 participants with various cancers, mostly women with breast cancer. Yoga was initiated during anticancer therapy in 13 studies and after therapy in eight studies; no studies examined yoga before treatment. It is unclear whether yoga during anticancer therapy improves short-, medium-, or long-term cancer-related fatigue. Yoga during therapy may increase short- and medium-term quality of life, but the evidence is very uncertain, and no studies measured long-term quality of life. Only one study reported adverse events, so it is unclear whether yoga affects safety outcomes. No meaningful differences were found between different yoga types, training formats, supervision levels, or cancer types. Yoga after anticancer therapy probably reduces short-term cancer-related fatigue, but its effects on medium-term fatigue are unclear, and long-term fatigue was not measured. Yoga after therapy may slightly increase short- and medium-term quality of life, but evidence is very uncertain, and long-term outcomes were not assessed. It is also unclear whether yoga after therapy leads to adverse events, and no differences were found between yoga types, cancer types, or age groups. Limitations include lack of blinding, which may influence results, and small or insufficiently long studies for several outcomes. More research is needed to determine how sustainable the effects of yoga are on cancer-related fatigue, quality of life, and adverse events.",1014,"Cancer-related fatigue (CRF), quality of life (QoL), randomised controlled trials (RCTs), anticancer therapy, standardised mean difference (SMD), confidence interval (CI), Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI), Cochrane risk of bias (RoB), GRADE.",What was the study trying to examine in terms of yoga's impact on cancer-related fatigue?,What methods were used to identify and include studies in the review?,What were the results found regarding yoga's effect on short-term cancer-related fatigue (CRF) after anticancer therapy?
bl61,static_2,Blood pressure drugs for preventing stroke and cardiovascular diseases in patients with a stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA),"Stroke is an important cause of death and disability worldwide. Since high blood pressure is an important risk factor for stroke and stroke recurrence, drugs that lower blood pressure might play an important role in secondary stroke prevention.
To investigate whether blood pressure-lowering drugs (BPLDs) started at least 48 hours after the index event are effective for the prevention of recurrent stroke, major vascular events, and dementia in people with stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA). Secondary objectives were to identify subgroups of people in which BPLDs are effective, and to investigate the optimum systolic blood pressure target after stroke or TIA for preventing recurrent stroke, major vascular events, and dementia.
In August 2017, we searched the Trials Registers of the Cochrane Stroke Group and the Cochrane Hypertension Group, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 8), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to August 2017), Embase Ovid (1974 to August 2017), ClinicalTrials.gov, the ISRCTN Registry, Stroke Trials Registry, Trials Central, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform Portal.
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of BPLDs started at least 48 hours after stroke or TIA.
Two review authors independently screened all titles and abstracts, selected eligible trials, extracted the data, assessed risk of bias, and used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence. If necessary, we contacted the principal investigators or corresponding authors for additional data.
We included 11 studies involving a total of 38,742 participants: eight studies compared BPLDs versus placebo or no treatment (35,110 participants), and three studies compared different systolic blood pressure targets (3632 participants). The risk of bias varied greatly between included studies. The pooled risk ratio (RR) of BPLDs for recurrent stroke was 0.81 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70 to 0.93; 8 RCTs; 35,110 participants; moderate-quality evidence), for major vascular event 0.90 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.04; 4 RCTs; 28,630 participants; high-quality evidence), and for dementia 0.88 (95% CI 0.73 to 1.06; 2 RCTs; 6671 participants; high-quality evidence). We mainly observed a reduced risk of recurrent stroke in the subgroup of participants using an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or a diuretic (I2statistic for subgroup differences 72.1%; P = 0.006). The pooled RR of intensive blood pressure-lowering for recurrent stroke was 0.80 (95% CI 0.63 to 1.00), and for major vascular event 0.58 (95% CI 0.23 to 1.46).
Our results support the use of BPLDs in people with stroke or TIA for reducing the risk of recurrent stroke. Current evidence is primarily derived from trials studying an ACE inhibitor or a diuretic. No definite conclusions can be drawn from current evidence regarding an optimal systolic blood pressure target after stroke or TIA.","Do blood pressure drugs prevent stroke, other blood vessel diseases, and dementia, in people with a stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA)? What blood pressure target is best for preventing stroke, other blood vessel diseases, and dementia, in people with a stroke or TIA?
Stroke, due to blocked or bleeding blood vessels in the brain affects about 14 million people worldwide each year. Stroke survivors are at increased risk of recurrent stroke, other blood vessel diseases, and dementia. High blood pressure is an important risk factor that can increase this risk. Blood pressure-lowering drugs are known to prevent first ever stroke. However, in stroke survivors lowering the blood pressure too far (using blood pressure drugs) may be harmful especially early after the stroke. Therefore, we reviewed trials that tested blood pressure-lowering drugs started at least 48 hours after the stroke or TIA.
Study characteristics : this review is up-to-date to August 2017. We included 11 trials involving 38,742 participants: eight trials assessed the effect of blood pressure drugs, and three trials compared different blood pressure targets. Ten studies were hospital-based and one trial was performed in a general practitioner setting. Not all trials contributed information to all outcomes.
Key results : blood pressure drugs lowered the risk of recurrent stroke in patients with a stroke or TIA, whereas there is insufficient evidence to conclude whether they reduce the risk of other blood vessel diseases and dementia. There is also insufficient evidence to conclude which blood pressure target is best for patients with a stroke or TIA.
Quality of the evidence : overall, the quality of the trials in this review was moderate. However, we found similar results in an analysis using only high-quality trials. More research is needed to investigate whether blood pressure drugs also prevent dementia, and what blood pressure targets are best for patients with a stroke or TIA.",1070,"stroke, blood pressure-lowering drugs (BPLDs), recurrent stroke, major vascular events, dementia, randomised controlled trials (RCTs), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, systolic blood pressure target, transient ischaemic attack (TIA), diuretic",What was the study trying to examine regarding blood pressure-lowering drugs (BPLDs) in people with stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA)?,What methods were used to select and analyze the relevant trials in the study?,What were the findings of the study regarding the effectiveness of blood pressure-lowering drugs for recurrent stroke and other outcomes?
bl61,static_2,Medicines to prevent breast cancer in women at above-average risk of developing breast cancer,"Breast cancer is the most frequently occurring malignancy and the second cause of death for cancer in women. Cancer prevention agents (CPAs) are a promising approach to reduce the burden of breast cancer. Currently, two main types of CPAs are available: selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs, such as tamoxifen and raloxifene) and aromatase inhibitors (AIs, such as exemestane and anastrozole).
To assess the efficacy and acceptability of single CPAs for the prevention of primary breast cancer, in unaffected women, at an above-average risk of developing breast cancer. Using a network meta-analysis, to rank single CPAs, based on their efficacy and acceptability (an endpoint that is defined as the inverse of CPA-related toxicity).
We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), and ClinicalTrials.gov on 17 August 2018. We handsearched reference lists to identify additional relevant studies.
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that enrolled women without a personal history of breast cancer but with an above-average risk of developing a tumor. Women had to be treated with a CPA and followed up to record the occurrence of breast cancer and adverse events.
Two review authors independently extracted data and conducted risk of bias assessments of the included studies, and assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. Outcome data included incidence of breast carcinoma (both invasive and in situ carcinoma) and adverse events (both overall and severe toxicity). We performed a conventional meta-analysis (for direct comparisons of a single CPA with placebo or a different CPA) and network meta-analysis (for indirect comparisons).
We included six studies enrolling 50,927 women randomized to receive one CPA (SERMs: tamoxifen or raloxifene, or AIs: exemestane or anastrozole) or placebo. Three studies compared tamoxifen and placebo, two studies compared AIs (exemestane or anastrozole) versus placebo, and one study compared tamoxifen versus raloxifene. The risk of bias was low for all RCTs. For the tamoxifen versus placebo comparison, tamoxifen likely resulted in a lower risk of developing breast cancer compared to placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 0.76; 3 studies, 22,832 women; moderate-certainty evidence). In terms of adverse events, tamoxifen likely increased the risk of severe toxicity compared to placebo (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.47; 2 studies, 20,361 women; moderate-certainty evidence). In particular, women randomized to receive tamoxifen experienced a higher incidence of both endometrial carcinoma (RR 2.26, 95% CI 1.52 to 3.38; high-certainty evidence) and thromboembolism (RR 2.10, 95% CI 1.14 to 3.89; high-certainty evidence) compared to women who received placebo. For the AIs versus placebo comparison, AIs (exemestane or anastrozole) reduced the risk of breast cancer by 53% (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.63; 2 studies, 8424 women; high-certainty evidence). In terms of adverse events, AIs increased the risk of severe toxicity by 18% (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.28; 2 studies, 8352 women; high-certainty evidence). These differences were sustained especially by endocrine (e.g. hot flashes), gastrointestinal (e.g. diarrhea), and musculoskeletal (e.g. arthralgia) adverse events, while there were no differences in endometrial cancer or thromboembolism rates between AIs and placebo. For the tamoxifen versus raloxifene comparison, raloxifene probably performed worse than tamoxifen in terms of breast cancer incidence reduction (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.43; 1 study, 19,490 women; moderate-certainty evidence), but its use was associated with lower toxicity rates (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.95; 1 study, 19,490 women; moderate-certainty evidence), particularly relating to incidence of endometrial cancer and thromboembolism. An indirect comparison of treatment effects allowed us to compare the SERMs and AIs in this review. In terms of efficacy, AIs (exemestane or anastrozole) may have reduced breast cancer incidence slightly compared to tamoxifen (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.98; 5 RCTs, 31,256 women); however, the certainty of evidence was low. A lack of model convergence did not allow us to analyze toxicity data.
For women with an above-average risk of developing breast cancer, CPAs can reduce the incidence of this disease. AIs appear to be more effective than SERMs (tamoxifen) in reducing the risk of developing breast cancer. AIs are not associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer and thromboembolic events. However, long-term data on toxicities from tamoxifen are available while the follow-up toxicity data on unaffected women taking AIs is relatively short. Additional data from direct comparisons are needed to fully address the issues of breast cancer prevention by risk-reducing medications, with special regards to acceptability (i.e. the benefit/harm ratio).","Breast cancer is the most frequent type of cancer and the second cause of death by cancer in women. Therefore, any strategy which can reduce its burden is eagerly awaited. Cancer prevention agents (CPAs) are medicines that might fulfil this need. Currently, two main types of CPAs are available to combat breast cancer: selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs, such as tamoxifen and raloxifene) and aromatase inhibitors (such as exemestane and anastrozole). Women without personal history of breast cancer, but with above-average risk of developing this disease (that is, with a lifetime risk greater than 17%) represent the usual target population for CPAs.
This Cochrane Review aimed to summarize the evidence on the efficacy and toxicity of CPAs for the prevention of primary breast cancer.
The review authors found six studies enrolling 50,927 women to receive one CPA or placebo (a pretend treatment, e.g. a sugar pill). Three studies involving 23,013 women compared tamoxifen and placebo, two studies involving 8424 women compared aromatase inhibitors (exemestane or anastrozole) and placebo, and one study involving 19,490 women that compared tamoxifen and raloxifene.
Based on the three studies that compared tamoxifen to placebo, tamoxifen probably reduced the risk of developing breast cancer by 32% compared to placebo. However, tamoxifen was associated with a 28% increased risk of severe side effects compared to placebo based on two studies involving 20,361 women. In particular, women taking tamoxifen experienced higher incidence of endometrial cancer and thromboembolism than women having no medicine.
For women who received either an aromatase inhibitor (exemestane or anastrozole) or placebo, aromatase inhibitors reduced the risk of breast cancer by 53% compared to placebo. Data from two studies involving 8352 women indicated that aromatase inhibitors increased the risk of severe side effects by 18% compared to placebo. These differences were sustained especially by endocrine (hormonal; e.g. hot flashes), gastrointestinal (e.g. diarrhea), and musculoskeletal (e.g. joint pain) side effects, whereas there were no differences in either endometrial cancer or thromboembolism rates.
For women who received either tamoxifen or raloxifene, raloxifene probably performed worse than tamoxifen in terms of breast cancer incidence reduction, but its use was associated with a 13% reduction of toxicity rates especially endometrial cancer and thromboembolism.
A specialized method named a 'network meta-analysis' allowed us to compare medications never directly compared to each other in a study. Based on this network meta-analysis, aromatase inhibitors may have led to a 23% additional risk reduction of developing breast cancer compared to tamoxifen. However, the reliability of the evidence was low meaning that further research is likely to have an impact on our confidence in this result. This analysis could not be performed on toxicity data.

bl61,static_2,Does personalised advice via computer or mobile devices reduce heavy drinking?,"Excessive alcohol use contributes significantly to physical and psychological illness, injury and death, and a wide array of social harm in all age groups. A proven strategy for reducing excessive alcohol consumption levels is to offer a brief conversation-based intervention in primary care settings, but more recent technological innovations have enabled people to interact directly via computer, mobile device or smartphone with digital interventions designed to address problem alcohol consumption. To assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of digital interventions for reducing hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption, alcohol-related problems, or both, in people living in the community, specifically: (i) Are digital interventions more effective and cost-effective than no intervention (or minimal input) controls? (ii) Are digital interventions at least equally effective as face-to-face brief alcohol interventions? (iii) What are the effective component behaviour change techniques (BCTs) of such interventions and their mechanisms of action? (iv) What theories or models have been used in the development and/or evaluation of the intervention? Secondary objectives were (i) to assess whether outcomes differ between trials where the digital intervention targets participants attending health, social care, education or other community-based settings and those where it is offered remotely via the internet or mobile phone platforms; (ii) to specify interventions according to their mode of delivery (e.g. functionality features) and assess the impact of mode of delivery on outcomes. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ERIC, HTA and Web of Knowledge databases; ClinicalTrials.com and WHO ICTRP trials registers and relevant websites to April 2017. We also checked the reference lists of included trials and relevant systematic reviews. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effectiveness of digital interventions compared with no intervention or with face-to-face interventions for reducing hazardous or harmful alcohol consumption in people living in the community and reported a measure of alcohol consumption. We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. We included 57 studies which randomised a total of 34,390 participants. The main sources of bias were from attrition and participant blinding (36% and 21% of studies respectively, high risk of bias). Forty one studies (42 comparisons, 19,241 participants) provided data for the primary meta-analysis, which demonstrated that participants using a digital intervention drank approximately 23 g alcohol weekly (95% CI 15 to 30) (about 3 UK units) less than participants who received no or minimal interventions at end of follow up (moderate-quality evidence). Fifteen studies (16 comparisons, 10,862 participants) demonstrated that participants who engaged with digital interventions had less than one drinking day per month fewer than no intervention controls (moderate-quality evidence), 15 studies (3587 participants) showed about one binge drinking session less per month in the intervention group compared to no intervention controls (moderate-quality evidence), and in 15 studies (9791 participants) intervention participants drank one unit per occasion less than no intervention control participants (moderate-quality evidence). Only five small studies (390 participants) compared digital and face-to-face interventions. There was no difference in alcohol consumption at end of follow up (MD 0.52 g/week, 95% CI -24.59 to 25.63; low-quality evidence). Thus, digital alcohol interventions produced broadly similar outcomes in these studies. No studies reported whether any adverse effects resulted from the interventions. A median of nine BCTs were used in experimental arms (range = 1 to 22). 'B' is an estimate of effect (MD in quantity of drinking, expressed in g/week) per unit increase in the BCT, and is a way to report whether individual BCTs are linked to the effect of the intervention. The BCTs of goal setting (B -43.94, 95% CI -78.59 to -9.30), problem solving (B -48.03, 95% CI -77.79 to -18.27), information about antecedents (B -74.20, 95% CI -117.72 to -30.68), behaviour substitution (B -123.71, 95% CI -184.63 to -62.80) and credible source (B -39.89, 95% CI -72.66 to -7.11) were significantly associated with reduced alcohol consumption in unadjusted models. In a multivariable model that included BCTs with B > 23 in the unadjusted model, the BCTs of behaviour substitution (B -95.12, 95% CI -162.90 to -27.34), problem solving (B -45.92, 95% CI -90.97 to -0.87), and credible source (B -32.09, 95% CI -60.64 to -3.55) were associated with reduced alcohol consumption. The most frequently mentioned theories or models in the included studies were Motivational Interviewing Theory (7/20), Transtheoretical Model (6/20) and Social Norms Theory (6/20). Over half of the interventions (n = 21, 51%) made no mention of theory. Only two studies used theory to select participants or tailor the intervention. There was no evidence of an association between reporting theory use and intervention effectiveness. There is moderate-quality evidence that digital interventions may lower alcohol consumption, with an average reduction of up to three (UK) standard drinks per week compared to control participants. Substantial heterogeneity and risk of performance and publication bias may mean the reduction was lower. Low-quality evidence from fewer studies suggested there may be little or no difference in impact on alcohol consumption between digital and face-to-face interventions. The BCTs of behaviour substitution, problem solving and credible source were associated with the effectiveness of digital interventions to reduce alcohol consumption and warrant further investigation in an experimental context. Reporting of theory use was very limited and often unclear when present. Over half of the interventions made no reference to any theories. Limited reporting of theory use was unrelated to heterogeneity in intervention effectiveness.","We aimed to find out if personalised advice to reduce heavy drinking provided using a computer or mobile device is better than nothing or printed information. We also compared advice provided using a computer or mobile device to advice given in a face-to-face conversation. The main outcome was how much alcohol people drank.
Heavy drinking causes over 60 diseases, as well as many accidents, injuries and early deaths each year. Brief advice or counselling, delivered by doctors or nurses, can help people reduce their drinking by around 4 to 5 units a week. In the UK, this is around two pints (1.13 L) of beer or half a bottle of wine (375 mL) each week. However, people may be embarrassed by talking about alcohol. The studies included people in workplaces, colleges or health clinics and internet users. Everyone typed information about their drinking into a computer or mobile device - which then gave half the people advice about how much they drank and the effect this has on health. This group also received suggestions about how to cut down on drinking. The other group could sometimes read general health information. Between one month and one year later, everyone was asked to confirm how much they were drinking. Drinking levels in both groups were compared to each other at these time points. Many (56%) studies were funded by government or research foundation funds. Some (11%) were funded by personal awards such as PhD fellowships. The rest did not report sources of funding. We included 57 studies comparing the drinking of people getting advice about alcohol from computers or mobile devices with those who did not after one to 12 months. Of these, 41 studies (42 comparisons, 19,241 participants) focused on the actual amounts that people reported drinking each week. Most people reported drinking less if they received advice about alcohol from a computer or mobile device compared to people who did not get this advice. Evidence shows that the amount of alcohol people cut down may be about 1.5 pints (800 mL) of beer or a third of a bottle of wine (250 mL) each week. Other measures supported the effectiveness of digital alcohol interventions, although the size of the effect tended to be smaller than for overall alcohol consumption. Positive differences in measures of drinking were seen at 1, 6 and 12 months after the advice. There was not enough information to help us decide if advice was better from computers, telephones or the internet to reduce risky drinking. We do not know which pieces of advice were the most important to help people reduce problem drinking. However, advice from trusted people such as doctors seemed helpful, as did recommendations that people think about specific ways they could overcome problems that might prevent them from drinking less and suggestions about things to do instead of drinking. We included five studies which compared the drinking of people who got advice from computers or mobile devices with advice from face-to-face conversations with doctors or nurses; there may be little or no difference between these to reduce heavy drinking. No studies reported whether any harm came from the interventions. Personalised advice using computers or mobile devices may help people reduce heavy drinking better than doing nothing or providing only general health information. Personalised advice through computers or mobile devices may make little or no difference to reduce drinking compared to face-to-face conversation.",1061,"digital interventions, alcohol consumption, brief conversation-based intervention, behaviour change techniques (BCTs), randomised controlled trials (RCTs), meta-analysis, motivational interviewing theory, binge drinking, transtheoretical model, credible source",What were the main objectives of the study regarding digital interventions for alcohol consumption?,What methodological approach did the study employ to evaluate the effectiveness of digital interventions compared to other interventions?,What were the key findings regarding the effectiveness of digital interventions in reducing alcohol consumption?
bl61,interactive_3,Ezetimibe for the prevention of heart disease and death,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains an important cause of mortality and morbidity, and high levels of blood cholesterol are thought to be the major modifiable risk factors for CVD. The use of statins is the preferred treatment strategy for the prevention of CVD, but some people at high-risk for CVD are intolerant to statin therapy or unable to achieve their treatment goals with the maximal recommended doses of statin. Ezetimibe is a selective cholesterol absorption inhibitor, whether it has a positive effect on CVD events remains uncertain. Results from clinical studies are inconsistent and a thorough evaluation of its efficacy and safety for the prevention of CVD and mortality is necessary.
To assess the efficacy and safety of ezetimibe for the prevention of CVD and all-cause mortality.
We searched the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and Web of Science on 27 June 2018, and two clinical trial registry platforms on 11 July 2018. We checked reference lists from primary studies and review articles for additional studies. No language restrictions were applied.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared ezetimibe versus placebo or ezetimibe plus other lipid-modifying drugs versus other lipid-modifying drugs alone in adults, with or without CVD, and which had a follow-up of at least 12 months.
Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, assessed risk of bias and contacted trialists to obtain missing data. We performed statistical analyses according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and used the GRADE to assess the quality of evidence.
We included 26 RCTs randomising 23,499 participants. All included studies assessed effects of ezetimibe plus other lipid-modifying drugs compared with other lipid-modifying drugs alone or plus placebo. Our findings were driven by the largest study (IMPROVE-IT), which had weights ranging from 41.5% to 98.4% in the different meta-analyses. Ezetimibe with statins probably reduces the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events compared with statins alone (risk ratio (RR) 0.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90 to 0.98; a decrease from 284/1000 to 267/1000, 95% CI 256 to 278; 21,727 participants; 10 studies; moderate-quality evidence). Trials reporting all-cause mortality used ezetimibe with statin or fenofibrate and found they have little or no effect on this outcome (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.05; 21,222 participants; 8 studies; high-quality evidence). Adding ezetimibe to statins probably reduces the risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.95; a decrease from 105/1000 to 92/1000, 95% CI 85 to 100; 21,145 participants; 6 studies; moderate-quality evidence) and non-fatal stroke (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.97; a decrease 32/1000 to 27/1000, 95% CI 23 to 31; 21,205 participants; 6 studies; moderate-quality evidence). Trials reporting cardiovascular mortality added ezetimibe to statin or fenofibrate, probably having little or no effect on this outcome (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.12; 19457 participants; 6 studies; moderate-quality evidence). The need for coronary revascularisation might be reduced by adding ezetimibe to statin (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.89 to 0.99; a decrease from 196/1000 to 184/1000, 95% 175 to 194; 21,323 participants; 7 studies); however, no difference in coronary revascularisation rate was observed when a sensitivity analysis was limited to studies with a low risk of bias. In terms of safety, adding ezetimibe to statins may make little or no difference in the risk of hepatopathy (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.35; 20,687 participants; 4 studies; low-quality evidence). It is uncertain whether ezetimibe increase or decrease the risk of myopathy (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.72 to 2.38; 20,581 participants; 3 studies; very low-quality evidence) and rhabdomyolysis, given the wide CIs and low event rate. Little or no difference in the risk of cancer, gallbladder-related disease and discontinuation due to adverse events were observed between treatment groups. For serum lipids, adding ezetimibe to statin or fenofibrate might further reduce the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol and triglyceride levels and likely increase the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels; however, substantial heterogeneity was detected in most analyses. None of the included studies reported on health-related quality of life.
Moderate- to high-quality evidence suggests that ezetimibe has modest beneficial effects on the risk of CVD endpoints, primarily driven by a reduction in non-fatal MI and non-fatal stroke, but it has little or no effect on clinical fatal endpoints. The cardiovascular benefit of ezetimibe might involve the reduction of LDL-C, total cholesterol and triglycerides. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether ezetimibe increases the risk of adverse events due to the low and very low quality of the evidence. The evidence for beneficial effects was mainly obtained from individuals with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD, predominantly with acute coronary syndrome) administered ezetimibe plus statins. However, there is limited evidence regarding the role of ezetimibe in primary prevention and the effects of ezetimibe monotherapy in the prevention of CVD, and these topics thus requires further investigation.","Is taking ezetimibe safe and does it prevent heart disease and death? Heart disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, and controlling lipid levels is one of the most effective strategies for preventing heart disease. The use of statins is the preferred treatment strategy for the prevention of heart disease, but some people at high risk of heart disease are intolerant to statins or with a poor response to statin therapy. Ezetimibe is a non-statin drug that can reduce the blood lipids levels by inhibiting cholesterol absorption, but whether it has beneficial effects on heart disease and death remains uncertain. This evidence is current up to July 2018. We included 26 studies involving 23,499 participants. These studies assessed the effects of ezetimibe plus other lipid-lowering drugs versus lipid-lowering drugs alone for heart disease. The participants were adults, and most of them had been diagnosed with coronary heart disease. Ezetimibe with statins probably reduces the risk for combined outcome of death due to heart disease, heart attack or stroke, but the benefit is moderate. However, adding ezetimibe to statin or fenofibrate have little or no effect on death from any cause. Treatment with ezetimibe and statin probably reduces the risk for non-fatal heart attacks and non-fatal stroke. Adding ezetimibe to statin or fenofibrate probably have little or no effect on heart-related death. Ezetimibe with statins might reduce the need for coronary revascularisation (the restoration of an adequate blood supply to the heart) by means of surgery. In terms of safety, we do not have enough evidence to know whether ezetimibe increases or decreases side-effects (e.g. liver injury, muscle pain, cancer, gallbladder-related disease and discontinuation). The analysis of blood lipids revealed that the addition of ezetimibe statin or fenofibrate therapy might further reduce the levels of blood lipids, including low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ('bad' cholesterol), total cholesterol and triglycerides, and likely increased the level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ('good' cholesterol). None of the included studies reported on health-related quality of life. There is a lack of evidence supporting the use of ezetimibe monotherapy for the prevention of heart disease, and this topic requires further investigation. The quality of evidence ranged from high to very low across the outcomes.",1044,"Cardiovascular disease, statins, ezetimibe, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, major adverse cardiovascular events, randomised controlled trials, risk ratio, high-quality evidence",What was the study trying to examine regarding ezetimibe in relation to cardiovascular disease and mortality?,What methods were used in the study to assess the efficacy and safety of ezetimibe for the prevention of cardiovascular disease?,What were the key results of the study in terms of ezetimibe's effect on cardiovascular endpoints and adverse events?
bl61,interactive_3,"Thymic peptides for treatment of cancer patients in addition to chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or both","Purified thymus extracts (pTE) and synthetic thymic peptides (sTP) are thought to enhance the immune system of cancer patients to help fight tumour growth and reduce infections caused by disease-related or treatment-related immunosuppression. This review evaluated the effectiveness of pTE and sTP for cancer management. Researchers searched major medical databases up to February 2010 for randomized trials in adult cancer patients where pTE or sTP were added to chemotherapy or radiotherapy and compared with the same regimen alone or with placebo. Data were independently extracted by two authors, and odds ratios were calculated for overall survival, disease-free survival, tumour response, and adverse effects. A random-effects model was used. Twenty-six trials involving 2736 patients were identified: 20 trials investigated pTE (thymostimulin or thymosin fraction 5) and six investigated sTP (thymopentin or thymosin ?1). Twenty-one trials reported overall survival, six reported disease-free survival, 14 reported tumour response, nine reported adverse effects, and 10 reported safety. Adding pTE showed no benefit for overall survival (RR 1.00), disease-free survival (RR 0.97), or tumour response (RR 1.07), with moderate to high heterogeneity. For thymosin ?1, the pooled RR for overall survival was 1.21 and for disease-free survival was 3.37, though neither result reached statistical significance. pTE reduced the risk of severe infectious complications (RR 0.54), and thymostimulin showed a non-significant trend toward reduced severe neutropenia. Both pTE and sTP were generally well tolerated. Many trials had at least moderate risk of bias. Overall, there is no clear evidence that adding pTE to cancer treatment improves survival or tumour response, although thymosin ?1 showed a possible trend toward benefit. There is preliminary evidence that pTE may reduce severe infectious complications during chemotherapy or radiotherapy.","The immune system plays a key role in the body�s own defences against cancer cells. The thymus gland plays a central part in this and modifies T-cells, a subset of lymphocytes. Studies with thymic peptides have shown a variety of effects on the immune system. There are two groups of thymic peptides available for use in treatment: purified extracts from animal (mostly calf) thymus glands and synthetically produced thymus gland peptides.
This review aims to answer the question whether having thymic peptides can improve the response to and tolerability of standard chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or combined treatment. Further questions are whether the peptides inhibit or reduce the progression and recurrence of disease, whether they prolong the life of cancer patients and whether quality of life is improved. This review looked at the evidence from 26 clinical trials with a total of 2736 adult cancer patients. Many of the trials were small and of moderate quality. Only three studies were less than 10 years old. Thymosin ?1 is a synthetic peptide that shows some promise as a treatment option for patients with metastatic melanoma when used in addition to chemotherapy. Severe problems occur during chemotherapy and radiotherapy due to low white blood cell counts and infections. These were reduced by using purified thymus extracts. However, the use of purified thymus extracts should be investigated more thoroughly before the extracts are used routinely in patients. The findings were not conclusive and caution is advised. Overall, thymic peptides seem to be well tolerated.",1021,"purified thymus extracts, synthetic thymic peptides, thymosin ?1, overall survival, disease-free survival, tumour response, severe infectious complications, risk of bias, random-effects model, chemotherapy",What was the primary objective of the study in relation to pTE and sTP for cancer management?,"What methods did the study employ to evaluate the effectiveness of pTE and sTP, including the type of trials and the data extraction process?","What were the main findings regarding the impact of pTE and sTP on overall survival, disease-free survival, tumor response, and adverse effects?"
bl61,interactive_3,"Education, incentive, and engineering-based interventions to promotethe use of seat belts","Over 1.3 million people die each year as a result of traffic collisions and hundreds of thousands of others are permanently and seriouslyinjured. Most of these deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries, where mortality rates can be up to 10 times higher than those ofsome high-income countries. Seat belts are designed to accomplish two key functions � to prevent the occupant from being ejected fromthe vehicle by the force of impact, and to extend the time that the decelerating force is applied to a person. Seat belts also spread the area ofimpact both to larger and less vulnerable parts of the body. Since the 1950s, seat belts have been factory-fitted to most vehicles, and todayaround 90% of high-income countries have adopted seat belt legislation that makes it mandatory for some, if not all, vehicle occupants towear seat belts. However, the simple passing of laws is not sufficient to ensure seat belt use, and, while the enforcement of seat belt lawsdoes increase seat belt use, other interventions have been developed to encourage voluntary � and hence sustainable � behaviour change. To evaluate the benefits of behavioural-change interventions (educational-based, incentive-based, engineering-based, or a combination,but not enforcement-based) that promote the use of seat belts, and to determine which types of interventions are most effective. On 9 August 2022, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), OvidSP Embase, OvidSP MEDLINE, 14other databases, and clinical trials registers. We also screened reference lists and conference proceedings, searched websites of relevantorganisations, and contacted road safety experts. The search was performed with no restrictions in terms of language and date ofpublication. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), both individually randomised and cluster-randomised, that evaluated education,engineering, incentive-based interventions (or combinations) that promoted seat belt use. Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of RCTs, evaluated the risk of bias, and extracted data. We performed a narrativesynthesis based on effect direction due to the heterogeneity observed between RCTs and reported the synthesis in accordance with reporting guidelines for systematic reviews without meta-analysis, as appropriate. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using theGRADE approach. We analysed data on the primary outcome, frequency of wearing a seat belt. None of the included RCTs reported theother primary outcome, crash-related injury rate or the secondary outcome, crash-related mortality rates of interest in this review. We included 15 completed RCTs (12 individual, parallel-group, and three cluster) that enroled 12,081 participants, published between1990 and 2022. Four trials were published between 2019 and 2022, and the remaining trials were published 10 or more years ago. Wealso identified four ongoing RCTs. Thirteen RCTs were conducted in the USA. Trials recruited participants from various sites (worksites,schools, emergency departments, a residential retirement community, and primary care settings) and different age groups (adults,late adolescents, early adolescents, and dyads). Thirteen trials investigated educational interventions, one of which used education inaddition to incentives (one of the intervention arms) measured through participant self-reports (12) and observation (one), and two trialsinvestigated engineering-based interventions measured through in-vehicle data monitor systems at various follow-up periods (six weeksto 36 months). We grouped RCTs according to types of education-based interventions: behavioural education-based, health risk appraisal (HRA), andother education-based interventions. The evidence suggests that behavioural education-based (four trials) interventions may promoteseat belt use and HRA interventions (one trial) likely promote seat belt use in the short term (six weeks to nine months). Four of the sixtrials that investigated behavioural education-based interventions found that the intervention compared to no or another interventionmay promote seat belt use. These effects were measured through participant self-report and at various time points (six-week to 12-monthfollow-up) (low-certainty evidence). One of the three trials investigating HRA only or with additional intervention versus no or anotherintervention showed observed effects likely to promote seat belt use (moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence suggests that engineering-based interventions using vehicle monitoring systems (with in-vehicle alerts and with or withoutnotifications/feedback) may promote the use of seat belts. One trial showed that engineering interventions (in-vehicle alerts and feedback)may promote seat belt use while the other showed unclear effects in two of the three intervention groups (low-certainty evidence). Bothtrials had small sample sizes and high baseline seat belt use. The evidence suggests that behavioural education-based interventions may promote seat belt use and HRA (including incentives) with orwithout additional interventions likely promote seat belt use. Likewise, for engineering-based interventions using in-vehicle data monitorsystems with in-vehicle alerts, with or without notifications/feedback the evidence suggests the interventions may promote the use ofseat belts. Well-designed RCTs are needed to further investigate the effectiveness of education and engineering-based interventions. High-qualitytrials that examine the potential benefits of incentives to promote seat belt use, either alone or in combination with other interventions, aswell as trials to investigate other types of interventions (such as technology, media/publicity, enforcement, insurance schemes, employerprogrammes, etc.) to promote the use of seat belts, are needed. Evidence from low- and middle-income economies is required to improvethe generalisability of the data. In addition, research focused on determining which interventions or types of interventions are mosteffective in different population groups is needed.","Why is wearing a seat belt important? Many people, mostly children and young adults, die each year as a result of road traffic injuries suggesting it to be a leading cause of death with around 75% of traffic-related deaths occurring among young males. Many others are permanently and seriously injured. Seat belts are designed to protect occupants from being thrown out of the vehicle by the force of impact, and spread the impact across less vulnerable parts of the body to lessen the damage. Passing laws mandating seat belt use is not sufficient to encourage seat belt use on its own. We investigated the effectiveness of education, incentive, or engineering-based interventions, but not law enforcement, to encourage seat belt use and determine which types of interventions are most effective. Educational-based interventions are structured programmes teaching drivers and passengers the importance of using seat belts. Engineering-based interventions are design changes to the vehicle structure that promote the wearing of seat belts, such as seat belt alarms, while incentives include rewards schemes. We searched for studies that randomly allocated people travelling in passenger or commercial vehicles to interventions aiming to improve seat belt use. We excluded people travelling in farming or agricultural vehicles since these are not deemed commercial vehicles. Two review authors independently evaluated studies to judge inclusion in the review. We recorded information about the study design, setting, participants, interventions, and outcomes. In terms of outcome, we looked at the frequency of wearing a seat belt as well as crash-related injuries and deaths. Because of the differences between the included studies, we provided a written account and assessed how much each result could be trusted using the ratings high, moderate, low, or very low quality, depending on our confidence in the reliability of the results. We summarised the findings and compared study results. We found 15 studies enrolling 12,081 participants and four ongoing studies. Thirteen studies were conducted in the USA and enrolled participants from various sites (worksites, schools, emergency departments, a residential retirement community, and primary care settings) and of different age groups (adults, late and early adolescents, and dyads of child/adolescent and parent/legal guardian). Twelve studies looked at educational interventions alone, one at education and incentives, and two at engineering-based interventions. All included studies reported on the frequency of wearing a seat belt; however, most studies (12) reported this outcome through participant self-reporting. The remaining studies reported the frequency of wearing a seat belt through in-vehicle data monitoring systems (two studies) and observation (one study). None of the included studies reported crash-related injuries and deaths. Some evidence suggests that education-based and engineering-based interventions may promote seat belt use; however, we cannot be confident in the current evidence. For education-based interventions, evidence suggests that behavioural-based (motivational interviews, behavioural change counselling, and behavioural messages) and HRA (alone or with educational information plus incentive) interventions may improve seat belt use in early adolescents, late adolescents, and adults. The evidence suggests that engineering-based interventions may promote seat belt use in early adolescents and adults. More research is needed to better understand the effectiveness of education- and engineering-based interventions on seat belt use. In addition, high-quality research is needed to investigate the benefit of incentives alone or in combination with other interventions as well as research to investigate other types of interventions, different combinations of interventions, settings (such as low- and middle-income countries), and populations. Only two studies looked at engineering-based interventions to improve seat belt use and both studies enrolled a small number of participants making it challenging to conclude that these interventions are beneficial. Trials investigating educational interventions to improve seat belt use vary in terms of the type of intervention, quality, number and types of people in the study, etc. Studies included children, adolescents, and adults; however, the most effective intervention for each population group remains unclear. Our confidence in the evidence was low or moderate, mainly due to the outcome (wearing seat belts) being measured through participant self-reporting. Self-reported outcomes are open to being influenced by participants answering in a manner they believe to be desirable or by participants' limited recollection of the event being studied. None of the included studies was conducted in countries where deaths and injuries related to road traffic accidents are the highest.",1059,"traffic collisions, seat belts, behavioural-change interventions, randomised controlled trials, systematic reviews, frequency of wearing a seat belt, educational interventions, engineering-based interventions, in-vehicle data monitor systems, health risk appraisal",What was the primary focus of the study conducted on seat belt usage?,What methodologies were employed to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions promoting seat belt use?,What were the key findings regarding the effectiveness of the different types of interventions examined in the study?
bl61,interactive_4,Statins for the prevention of dementia,"This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2001 and then updated in 2009. Vascular risk factors including high cholesterol levels increase the risk of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease and of vascular dementia. Some observational studies have suggested an association between statin use and lowered incidence of dementia.
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of statins for the prevention of dementia in people at risk of dementia due to their age and to determine whether the efficacy and safety of statins for this purpose depends on cholesterol level, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype or cognitive level.
We searched ALOIS (the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group), The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) Portal on 11 November 2015. We included double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials in which statins were administered for at least 12 months to people at risk of dementia. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We included two trials with 26,340 participants aged 40 to 82 years of whom 11,610 were aged 70 or older. All participants had a history of, or risk factors for, vascular disease. The studies used different statins (simvastatin and pravastatin). Mean follow-up was 3.2 years in one study and five years in one study. The risk of bias was low. Only one study reported on the incidence of dementia (20,536 participants, 31 cases in each group; odds ratio (OR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61 to 1.65, moderate quality evidence, downgraded due to imprecision). Both studies assessed cognitive function, but at different times using different scales, so we judged the results unsuitable for a meta-analysis. There were no differences between statin and placebo groups on five different cognitive tests (high quality evidence). Rates of treatment discontinuation due to non-fatal adverse events were less than 5% in both studies and there was no difference between statin and placebo groups in the risk of withdrawal due to adverse events (26,340 participants, 2 studies, OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.05). There is good evidence that statins given in late life to people at risk of vascular disease do not prevent cognitive decline or dementia. Biologically, it seems feasible that statins could prevent dementia due to their role in cholesterol reduction and initial evidence from observational studies was very promising. However, indication bias may have been a factor in these studies and the evidence from subsequent RCTs has been negative. There were limitations in the included studies involving the cognitive assessments used and the inclusion of participants at moderate to high vascular risk only.","Dementia (including Alzheimer's disease) is a global healthcare concern; the number of people affected worldwide is predicted to double every 20 years, reaching 74.7 million in 2010 and 131.5 million in 2050. Therefore, it is important to find means of preventing dementia. It has been suggested that high levels of cholesterol in the serum (part of the blood) may increase the risk of dementia and that treatment with cholesterol-lowering medicines such as statins may reduce the risk of dementia. We searched medical databases for clinical trials comparing giving a statin to giving a placebo (pretend medicine) to people with normal cognitive function (which is brain activities that allow us to gain and use knowledge) and of sufficient age to be at risk of Alzheimer's disease. There were limitations in the included studies involving the methods of assessment of cognition and the inclusion only of participants deemed to be of moderate to high risk of a problem with their blood (vascular) system. Nevertheless, there was good evidence that statins given in late life to people at risk of vascular disease do not prevent cognitive decline or dementia.",1131,"statins, dementia, Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, vascular risk factors, cholesterol levels, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype, cognitive function, randomized, placebo-controlled trials",What was the study trying to examine regarding the use of statins and the prevention of dementia?,"What methods were used in the study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of statins, including participant selection and data collection?",What were the results found in the study regarding the incidence of dementia and cognitive function in participants using statins compared to those on a placebo?
bl61,interactive_4,Does random drug and alcohol testing prevent injuries in workers?,"Drug- and alcohol-related impairment in the workplace has been linked to an increased risk of injury for workers. Randomly testing populations of workers for these substances has become a practice in many jurisdictions, with the intention of reducing the risk of workplace incidents and accidents. Despite the proliferation of random drug and alcohol testing (RDAT), there is currently a lack of consensus about whether it is effective at preventing workplace injury, or improving other non-injury accident outcomes in the work place.
To assess the effectiveness of workplace RDAT to prevent injuries and improve non-injury accident outcomes (unplanned events that result in damage or loss of property) in workers compared with no workplace RDAT.
We conducted a systematic literature search to identify eligible published and unpublished studies. The date of the last search was 1 November 2020. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, two other databases, Google Scholar, and three trials registers. We also screened the reference lists of relevant publications known to us.
Study designs that were eligible for inclusion in our review included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-randomised trials (CRTs), interrupted time-series (ITS) studies, and controlled before-after (CBA) studies. Studies needed to evaluate the effectiveness of RDAT in preventing workplace injury or improving other non-injury workplace outcomes. We also considered unpublished data from clinical trial registries. We included employees working in all safety-sensitive occupations, except for commercial drivers, who are the subject of another Cochrane Review.
Independently, two review authors used a data collection form to extract relevant characteristics from the included study. They then analysed a line graph included in the study of the prevalence rate of alcohol violations per year. Independently, the review authors completed a GRADE assessment, as a means of rating the quality of the evidence.
Although our searching originally identified 4198 unique hits, only one study was eligible for inclusion in this review. This was an ITS study that measured the effect of random alcohol testing (RAT) on the test positivity rate of employees of major airlines in the USA from 1995 to 2002. The study included data from 511,745 random alcohol tests, and reported no information about testing for other substances. The rate of positive results was the only outcome of interest reported by the study. The average rate of positive results found by RAT increased from 0.07% to 0.11% when the minimum percentage of workers who underwent RAT annually was reduced from 25% to 10%. Our analyses found this change to be a statistically significant increase (estimated change in level, where the level reflects the average percentage points of positive tests = 0.040, 95% confidence interval 0.005 to 0.075; P = 0.031). Our GRADE assessment, for the observed effect of lower minimum testing percentages associating with a higher rate of positive test results, found the quality of the evidence to be 'very low' across the five GRADE domains. The one included study did not address the following outcomes of interest: fatal injuries; non-fatal injuries; non-injury accidents; absenteeism; and adverse effects associated with RDAT.
In the aviation industry in the USA, the only setting for which the eligible study reported data, there was a statistically significant increase in the rate of positive RAT results following a reduction in the percentage of workers tested, which we deem to be clinically relevant. This result suggests an inverse relationship between the proportion of positive test results and the rate of testing, which is consistent with a deterrent effect for testing. No data were reported on adverse effects related to RDAT. We could not draw definitive conclusions regarding the effectiveness of RDAT for employees in safety-sensitive occupations (not including commercial driving), or with safety-sensitive job functions. We identified only one eligible study that reflected one industry in one country, was of non-randomised design, and tested only for alcohol, not for drugs or other substances. Our GRADE assessment resulted in a 'very low' rating for the quality of the evidence on the only outcome reported. The paucity of eligible research was a major limitation in our review, and additional studies evaluating the effect of RDAT on safety outcomes are needed.","Workplace accidents and injuries happen more often when people's physical abilities and judgement are impaired by drugs or alcohol. The workplace is not usually a place where research is conducted. There are many factors that make it difficult for an employer to measure the impact of a workplace drug testing program on the overarching goal of ensuring a safe workplace. Some employers � particularly in sectors where safety is very important, such as the commercial driving and airline industries � choose to test workers randomly for drugs and alcohol (random drug and alcohol testing (RDAT)). Through such testing, employers hope to deter employees from inappropriate use of these substances. However, we do not know if RDAT produces the desired effect. We wanted to know whether RDAT in the workplace prevents injuries and unplanned events that result in damage or loss of property (non-injury accidents) compared with no RDAT. We wanted to include all of the relevant research about RDAT in the workplace in our review. We looked for different kinds of published studies that measured how RDAT affected workplace safety. We excluded research on RDAT in commercial drivers, because another Cochrane Review covering these studies has already been published. Two authors from our team examined all of the references identified by our search, but they found only one study that met our selection criteria and could be included in the review. This study investigated random alcohol testing in airline employees in the USA whose jobs included safety-related tasks. The study did not test employees for drugs. Airlines are required by law to test and report on a randomly selected sample of their employees. The study used testing data from between 1995 and 2002. A total of 511,745 random alcohol tests were performed on airline employees. From 1995 to 1997, random tests for alcohol included 25% of the relevant airlines' workforce each year. During this period, the average percentage of employees who tested positive for alcohol was 0.07%. From 1998 to 2002, the proportion of the workforce tested each year dropped to 10%. During this period, the average percentage of employees who tested positive for alcohol increased to 0.11%. This means that when the airlines randomly tested a larger percentage of employees per year, a smaller proportion of them tested positive for alcohol. This relationship between the frequency of alcohol testing and the proportion of positive tests is what we would expect to see if testing has a deterrent effect, though one study alone cannot prove that there is a deterrent effect. This study did not provide any information for other areas of interest to us, specifically: fatal injuries; non-fatal injuries (in which people are physically injured, but do not die); 'non-injury accidents'; that is, accidents in which people are not injured, but property, processes, materials, and/or the environment are damaged; absenteeism; and unwanted, or adverse, events associated with RDAT, including impacts on privacy, confidentiality and employee perceptions. Two of our team rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as number of studies, study size and methods. Overall, our confidence in the evidence was very low. This means we cannot rely on what this study reported to make generalisations about the effectiveness of random alcohol testing alone, or random alcohol testing combined with drug testing (RDAT), in the workplace. We need researchers to do more studies to find the answers.",1058,"random drug and alcohol testing, workplace injury, non-injury accident outcomes, systematic literature search, randomised controlled trials, cluster-randomised trials, interrupted time-series studies, controlled before-after studies, GRADE assessment, aviation industry",What was the study trying to examine in terms of workplace RDAT effectiveness?,What methods were used to analyze the effectiveness of RDAT in preventing workplace injuries?,What results did the study find regarding the rate of positive alcohol test results in the aviation industry after reducing the percentage of workers tested?
bl61,interactive_4,Drugs for preventing lung cancer in healthy people,"This is the second update of this Cochrane Review. Some studies have suggested a protective effect of antioxidant nutrients and higher dietary levels of fruits and vegetables on lung cancer. To determine whether vitamins and minerals and other potential agents, alone or in combination, reduce lung cancer incidence and lung cancer mortality in healthy populations. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase from 1974 to May 2019 and screened references included in published studies and reviews. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing vitamins or mineral supplements with placebo, administered to healthy people with the aim of preventing lung cancer. Four review authors independently selected the trials to be included in the review, assessed their methodological quality and extracted data. For dichotomous outcomes we calculated risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and pooled results using the random-effects model. We assessed the risk of bias using Cochrane's 'Risk of bias' assessment tool and certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. In this update, we identified three new trials for a total of 12 studies. Six analysed vitamin A, three vitamin C, three combined vitamin D3 + calcium, four vitamin E combined with other products, one selenium supplements and nine studied combinations of two or more products. Four studies included only men and five only women. Vitamin A results in little to no difference in lung cancer incidence (RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.19; 5 RCTs, 212314 participants; high-certainty evidence) and lung cancer mortality (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.38; 3 RCTs, 190118 participants; high-certainty evidence). But in smokers or asbestos workers vitamin A increases the risk of lung cancer incidence (RR 1.10, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.20; 3 RCTs, 43995 participants; high-certainty evidence), lung cancer mortality (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.38; 2 RCTs, 29426 participants; high-certainty evidence) and all-cause mortality (RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.13; 2 RCTs, 32883 participants; high-certainty evidence). Vitamin A increases the risk of minor side effects, such as yellowing of the skin and minor gastrointestinal symptoms (high-certainty evidence). Vitamin C likely results in little to no difference in lung cancer incidence (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.49; 2 RCTs, 14953 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). In women, vitamin C increases the risk of lung cancer incidence (RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.95; 1 RCT, 7627 participants; high-certainty evidence). In men, vitamin C results in little to no difference in mortality for lung cancer (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.23; 1 RCT, 7326 participants; high-certainty evidence). Vitamin D + calcium may result in little to no difference in lung cancer incidence in postmenopausal women (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.39 to 2.08; 3 RCTs, 37601 women; low-certainty evidence). Vitamin E results in little to no difference in lung cancer incidence (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.14; 3 RCTs, 36841 participants; high-certainty evidence) or to lung cancer mortality (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.18; 2 RCTs, 29214 participants; high-certainty evidence), but increases the risk of haemorrhagic strokes (hazard ratio (HR), 1.74, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.91; 1 RCT, 14641 participants; high-certainty evidence). Calcium results in little to no difference in lung cancer incidence in postmenopausal women (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.13 to 3.18; 1 RCT, 733 participants) or in risk of renal calculi (RR 1.94, 95% CI 0.20 to 18.57; 1 RCT, 733 participants; low-certainty evidence). Selenium in men results in little to no difference in lung cancer incidence (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.54; 1 RCT, 17448 participants; high-certainty evidence) and lung cancer mortality (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.66; 1 RCT, 17448 participants; high-certainty evidence) and increases the risk for grade 1 to 2 dermatitis (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.31; 1 RCT, 17448 participants; high-certainty evidence) and for alopecia (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.53; 1 RCT, 17448 participants; high-certainty evidence). The combination of vitamins A, C, E + selenium + zinc results in little to no difference in lung cancer incidence (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.48; 1 RCT, 12741 participants; high-certainty evidence). Well-designed RCTs have shown no beneficial effect of supplements for the prevention of lung cancer and lung cancer mortality in healthy people. Vitamin A supplements increase lung cancer incidence and mortality in smokers or persons exposed to asbestos. Vitamin C increases lung cancer incidence in women. Vitamin E increases the risk of haemorrhagic strokes.","We reviewed the evidence assessing the relationship between vitamins or antioxidant intake and lung cancer prevention, mortality and adverse events for that cancer. This review updates our Cochrane Review on this topic published in 2012. Lung cancer is among the leading causes of cancer death throughout the world, and its prevention has become a public health priority. It has been suggested that vitamin supplements and some antioxidants may prevent lung cancer. This review includes 12 studies in which healthy adults were randomly assigned to receive vitamin supplements or placebo (a substance that has no physical effects) and were followed over time to evaluate their risk of developing lung cancer. The evidence is current to May 2019. None of the treatments compared with placebo have shown a difference in the risk for lung cancer incidence or lung cancer mortality in healthy people. In smokers and people exposed to asbestos, vitamin A increases lung cancer incidence, lung cancer mortality and all-cause mortality. Vitamin C increases lung cancer incidence in women. Vitamin E increases the risk of haemorrhagic strokes.

bl61,finetuned_5,Does galantamine help people with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease and people with mild cognitive impairment?,"Dementia leads to progressive cognitive decline, and represents a significant health and societal burden. Its prevalence is growing, with Alzheimer's disease as the leading cause. There is no cure for Alzheimer's disease, but there are regulatory-approved pharmacological interventions, such as galantamine, for symptomatic relief.  To assess the clinical effects, including adverse effects, of galantamine in people with probable or possible Alzheimer's disease or mild cognitive impairment, and to investigate potential moderators of effect. We systematically searched the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialised Register on 14 December 2022 using the term 'galantamine'. The Register contains records of clinical trials identified from major electronic databases (including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase), trial registries, grey literature sources, and conference proceedings. We manually searched reference lists and collected information from US Food and Drug Administration documents and unpublished trial reports. We imposed no language restrictions. We included double-blind, parallel-group, randomised controlled trials comparing oral galantamine with placebo for a treatment duration exceeding four weeks in people with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease or with mild cognitive impairment. Working independently, two review authors selected studies for inclusion, assessed their quality, and extracted data. Outcomes of interest included cognitive function, change in global function, activities of daily living, functional disability, behavioural function, and adverse events. We used a fixed-effect model for meta-analytic synthesis, and presented results as Peto odds ratios (OR) or weighted mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals. We used Cochrane's original risk of bias tool (RoB 1) to assess the risk of bias in the included studies. We included 21 studies with a total of 10,990 participants. The average age of participants was 74 years, and 37% were male. The studies' durations ranged from eight weeks to two years, with 24 weeks being the most common duration. One newly included study assessed the effects of galantamine at two years, and another newly included study involved participants with severe Alzheimer's disease. Nineteen studies with 10,497 participants contributed data to the meta-analysis. All studies had low to unclear risk of bias for randomisation, allocation concealment, and blinding. We judged four studies to be at high risk of bias due to attrition and two due to selective outcome reporting. Galantamine for dementia due to Alzheimer's disease We summarise only the results for galantamine given at 8 to 12 mg twice daily (total galantamine 16 mg to 24 mg/day), assessed at six months. See the full review for results of other dosing regimens and assessment time points. There is high-certainty evidence that, compared to placebo, galantamine improves: cognitive function, as assessed with the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale – Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-cog) (MD-2.86, 95% CI -3.29 to -2.43; 6 studies, 3049 participants; minimum clinically important effect (MCID) = 2.6- to 4-point change); functional disability, as assessed with the Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD) scale (MD 2.12, 95% CI 0.75 to 3.49; 3 studies, 1275 participants); and behavioural function, as assessed with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) (MD -1.63, 95% CI -3.07 to -0.20; 2 studies, 1043 participants) at six months. Galantamine may improve global function at six months, as assessed with the Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change plus Caregiver Input (CIBIC-plus) (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.36 to 1.84; 6 studies, 3002 participants; low-certainty evidence). Participants who received galantamine were more likely than placebo-treated participants to discontinue prematurely (22.7% versus 17.2%) (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.68; 6 studies, 3336 participants; high-certainty evidence), and experience nausea (20.9% versus 8.4%) (OR 2.89, 95% CI 2.40 to 3.49; 7 studies, 3616 participants; high-certainty evidence) during the studies. Galantamine reduced death rates at six months: 1.3% of participants in the galantamine groups had died compared to 2.3% in the placebo groups (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.96; 6 studies, 3493 participants; high-certainty evidence). Galantamine for mild cognitive impairment We summarise results, assessed at two years, from two studies that gave participants galantamine at 8 to 12 mg twice daily (total galantamine 16 mg to 24 mg/day). Compared to placebo, galantamine may not improve cognitive function, as assessed with the expanded ADAS-cog for mild cognitive impairment (MD -0.21, 95% CI -0.78 to 0.37; 2 studies, 1901 participants; low-certainty evidence) or activities of daily living, assessed with the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study – Activities of Daily Living scale for mild cognitive impairment (MD 0.30, 95% CI -0.26 to 0.86; 2 studies, 1901 participants; low-certainty evidence). Participants who received galantamine were probably more likely to discontinue prematurely than placebo-treated participants (40.7% versus 28.6%) (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.42 to 2.05; 2 studies, 2057 participants) and to experience nausea (29.4% versus 10.7%) (OR 3.49, 95% CI 2.75 to 4.44; 2 studies, 2057 participants), both with moderate-certainty evidence. Galantamine may not reduce death rates at 24 months compared to placebo (0.5% versus 0.1%) (OR 5.03, 95% CI 0.87 to 29.10; 2 studies, 2057 participants; low-certainty evidence). Results from subgroup analysis and meta-regression suggest that an imbalance in discontinuation rates between galantamine and placebo groups, together with the use of the 'last observation carried forward' approach to outcome assessment, may potentially bias cognitive outcomes in favour of galantamine. Compared to placebo, galantamine (when given at a total dose of 16 mg to 24 mg/day) slows the decline in cognitive function, functional ability, and behaviour at six months in people with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. Galantamine probably also slows declines in global function at six months. The changes observed in cognition, assessed with the ADAS-cog scale, were clinically meaningful. Gastrointestinal-related adverse events are the primary concerns associated with galantamine use in people with dementia, which may limit its tolerability. Although death rates were generally low, participants in the galantamine groups had a reduced risk of death compared to those in the placebo groups. There is no evidence to support the use of galantamine in people with mild cognitive impairment.","Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia among older people that causes problems with memory, thinking, and behaviour. The disease worsens over time to the extent that it affects a person's ability to carry out day-to-day tasks. For people with mild cognitive impairment, symptoms affecting thinking and memory are mild and usually not serious enough to interfere with daily life and activities. Currently, there is no cure for Alzheimer's disease, but medications that can help with symptoms are available. Galantamine is one of the three cholinesterase inhibitor medications approved by the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Galantamine works by increasing the levels of a chemical in the brain, acetylcholine, that transmits signals, which may help with symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. There are no medications currently approved by regulatory bodies as treatments for mild cognitive impairment. We wanted to know whether galantamine is effective and helpful in improving the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment, in terms of memory, ability to carry out self-care, and behaviour. We also wanted to find out if galantamine causes any unwanted effects. We searched for studies that compared galantamine given by mouth to placebo (which does not contain any active ingredients but is given in the same way as the active medication) in people with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, or with mild cognitive impairment. We chose studies in which people were assigned randomly (like a flip of a coin) to receive galantamine or placebo for at least 4 weeks. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 21 studies that involved 10,990 people with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, or with mild cognitive impairment. Their average age was 74 years. Treatment durations ranged from 8 weeks to 2 years. Most studies included people with dementia due to mild or moderate Alzheimer's disease; one study involved people with severe Alzheimer's disease. Three studies included people with mild cognitive impairment. Pharmaceutical companies (Janssen / Johnson & Johnson) sponsored 16 of the 21 included studies. After 6 months of treatment, participants with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease who received galantamine had better memory, ability to do self-care activities, and behaviour than those who received placebo. Importantly, the memory improvements we observed were considered clinically meaningful according to standards set by experts. This same group of participants probably had better overall improvement than those who received placebo. In people with mild cognitive impairment, galantamine, compared to placebo, may make little to no difference in improving memory or the ability to do self-care activities. However, participants who received galantamine probably had a lower risk of progression to dementia after 2 years of treatment. Compared to those taking placebo, people on galantamine were three times more likely to experience gastrointestinal side effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea). The number of deaths was low, and there was no evidence that galantamine caused more deaths than placebo. Many people in the studies (ranging from 17% to 40%) stopped taking their assigned medication early, more so in the galantamine groups than the placebo groups. This is a limitation which may favour galantamine.",1126,"Dementia, Alzheimer's disease, galantamine, cognitive function, mild cognitive impairment, meta-analysis, randomised controlled trials, placebo, adverse events, Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change plus Caregiver Input.",What were the clinical effects and potential moderators of effect that the study was trying to examine with galantamine treatment in Alzheimer's disease?,"What methods did the researchers use to select studies, assess their quality, and extract data for evaluating the effects of galantamine?","What were the main findings regarding the impact of galantamine on cognitive function, functional disability, and behaviour in Alzheimer's patients at six months compared to placebo?"
bl61,finetuned_5,Drug or psychological interventions for preventing depression in people with long-term physical conditions,"Major depression is one of the world�s leading causes of disability in adults with long-term physical conditions compared to those without physical illness. This co-morbidity is associated with a negative prognosis in terms of increased morbidity and mortality rates, increased healthcare costs, decreased adherence to treatment regimens, and a substantial decline in quality of life. Therefore, preventing the onset of depressive episodes in adults with long-term physical conditions should be a global healthcare aim. In this review, primary or tertiary (in cases of preventing recurrences in those with a history of depression) prevention are the focus. While primary prevention aims at preventing the onset of depression, tertiary prevention comprises both preventing recurrences and prohibiting relapses. Tertiary prevention aims to address a depressive episode that might still be present, is about to subside, or has recently resolved. We included tertiary prevention in the case where the focus was preventing the onset of depression in those with a history of depression (preventing recurrences) but excluded it if it specifically focused on maintaining an condition or implementing rehabilitation services (relapse prevention). Secondary prevention of depression seeks to prevent the progression of depressive symptoms by early detection and treatment and may therefore be considered a 'treatment,' rather than prevention. We therefore exclude the whole spectrum of secondary prevention. To assess the effectiveness, acceptability and tolerability of psychological or pharmacological interventions, in comparison to control conditions, in preventing depression in adults with long-term physical conditions; either before first ever onset of depressive symptoms (i.e. primary prevention) or before first onset of depressive symptoms in patients with a history of depression (i.e. tertiary prevention). We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and two trials registries, up to 6 February 2020. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of preventive psychological or pharmacological interventions, specifically targeting incidence of depression in comparison to treatment as usual (TAU), waiting list, attention/psychological placebo, or placebo. Participants had to be age 18 years or older, with at least one long-term physical condition, and no diagnosis of major depression at baseline (primary prevention). In addition, we included studies comprising mixed samples of patients with and without a history of depression, which explored tertiary prevention of recurrent depression. We excluded other tertiary prevention studies. We also excluded secondary preventive interventions. Primary outcomes included incidence of depression, tolerability, and acceptability. Secondary outcomes included severity of depression, cost-effectiveness and cost-utility. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We included 11 RCTs, with one trial on psychological interventions, and 10 trials on pharmacological interventions. Data analyses on the psychological intervention (problem-solving therapy compared to TAU) included 194 participants with age-related macular degeneration. Data analyses on pharmacological interventions included 837 participants comparing citalopram (one trial), escitalopram (three trials), a mixed sample of fluoxetine/nortriptyline (one trial), melatonin (one trial), milnacipran (one trial), and sertraline (three trials), each to placebo. Included types of long-term physical conditions were acute coronary syndrome (one trial), breast cancer (one trial), head and neck cancer (two trials), stroke (five trials), and traumatic brain injury (one trial). Very low-certainty evidence of one study suggests that problem solving therapy may be slightly more effective than TAU in preventing the incidence of depression, immediately post-intervention (odds ratio (OR) 0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.20 to 0.95; 194 participants). However, there may be little to no difference between groups at six months follow-up (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.38; 190 participants; one study; very low-certainty evidence). No data were available regarding incidence of depression after six months. Regarding acceptability (drop-outs due to any cause), slightly fewer drop-outs occurred in the TAU group immediately post-intervention (OR 5.21, 95% CI 1.11 to 24.40; 206 participants; low-certainty evidence). After six months, however, the groups did not differ (OR 1.67, 95% CI 0.58 to 4.77; 206 participants; low-certainty evidence). This study did not measure tolerability. Post-intervention, compared to placebo, antidepressants may be beneficial in preventing depression in adults with different types of long-term physical conditions, but the evidence is very uncertain (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.49; 814 participants; nine studies; I2 = 0%; very low-certainty evidence). There may be little to no difference between groups both immediately and at six months follow-up (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.08 to 2.46; 23 participants; one study; very low-certainty evidence) as well as at six to 12 months follow-up (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.23 to 2.82; 233 participants; three studies; I2 = 49%; very low-certainty evidence). There was very low-certainty evidence from five studies regarding the tolerability of the pharmacological intervention. A total of 669 adverse events were observed in 316 participants from the pharmacological intervention group, and 610 adverse events from 311 participants in the placebo group. There was very low-certainty evidence that drop-outs due to adverse events may be less frequent in the placebo group (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.07 to 3.89; 561 participants; five studies; I2 = 0%). There was also very low-certainty evidence that drop-outs due to any cause may not differ between groups either post-intervention (OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.73; 962 participants; nine studies; I2 = 28%), or at six to 12 months (OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.86; 327 participants; three studies; I2 = 0%). Based on evidence of very low certainty, our results may indicate the benefit of pharmacological interventions, during or directly after preventive treatment. Few trials examined short-term outcomes up to six months, nor the follow-up effects at six to 12 months, with studies suffering from great numbers of drop-outs and inconclusive results. Generalisation of results is limited as study populations and treatment regimes were very heterogeneous. Based on the results of this review, we conclude that for adults with long-term physical conditions, there is only very uncertain evidence regarding the implementation of any primary preventive interventions (psychological/pharmacological) for depression.","People with long-term illness or other physical health conditions have a higher risk than other people of developing depression. This can reduce their quality of life. Depression is characterised by symptoms such as low mood, feelings of hopelessness, loss of interest in things that once gave pleasure, and other symptoms, as well as sleep disturbances. People with long-term physical conditions who develop depression are more likely to worsen in their illnesses and are more likely to die. Therefore, preventing depression in people with long-term physical conditions should be an important goal in healthcare. We wanted to know whether standard interventions for treating depression (i.e. psychological treatments and antidepressant drugs) can also safely be used to prevent the onset of an depressive episode in those adults at high risk for depression due to their long-term physical condition, but who do not yet show depressive symptoms. We also wanted to know whether these interventions worked in preventing recurrent depression, in those patients with long-term physical conditions who had a history of depression. First, we searched the medical literature for randomised controlled studies (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups). This type of study provides the most robust evidence about the effects of a treatment. We then compared the results, and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we assessed how certain the evidence was. To do this, we considered factors such as the way studies were conducted, study sizes, and consistency of findings across studies. Based on our assessments, we categorised the evidence as being of very low, low, moderate or high certainty. Medical and mental health care providers (including physicians and psychologists) and pharmacists, as well as adults with long-term physical conditions, their relatives and care-givers. This review includes 11 trials comparing a psychological intervention (problem-solving therapy) to treatment as usual; or comparing pharmacological antidepressant interventions (citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline, fluoxetine/nortriptyline, milnacipran, or melatonin) to placebo. For the psychological intervention, we found only one trial, including 194 people with age-related macular degeneration (an eye disease). For pharmacological interventions, we included 10 trials comprising 1009 people. Due to some participants not completing the studies, we could only analyse data for 837 participants. Our analyses show that people with long-term physical conditions may be less likely to develop depression during treatment with problem solving therapy, or with different types of antidepressants. However, these interventions appear to be beneficial only during treatment. Three to 12 months after treatment, there was no significant difference in onset of depression between the groups that had the interventions and those that did not. Therefore, preventive interventions might be effective in preventing depression onset only for the duration of the intervention. Our conclusions are based on evidence of very low certainty. In addition, there is not enough adequate information on the tolerability (unpleasant but generally medically less important adverse events due to the intervention, e.g. dry mouth) and acceptability (willingness to go through with the intervention even in the presence of adverse events) of these treatments. The interventions may be unsafe, irrespective of their potential to prevent depression.",1119,"Major depression, long-term physical conditions, co-morbidity, primary prevention, tertiary prevention, randomised controlled trials (RCTs), psychological interventions, pharmacological interventions, incidence of depression, tolerability.",What was the study trying to examine regarding preventive interventions for depression in adults with long-term physical conditions?,What methods were used in the study to assess the effectiveness of psychological and pharmacological interventions?,What were the results found in the study concerning the effectiveness and certainty of the preventive interventions?
bl61,finetuned_5,Interventions to prevent asthma attacks in children upon return to school in the autumn,"Asthma exacerbations in school-aged children peak in autumn shortly after they return to school, likely due to factors such as poor treatment adherence, increased allergen and viral exposure, and changes in immune tolerance. Because this seasonal peak is predictable�occurring in September in the Northern Hemisphere and February in the Southern Hemisphere�targeted interventions may help reduce exacerbations and lessen the strain on health services. This review assessed the effects of pharmacological and behavioural interventions implemented before school return to reduce autumn asthma exacerbations in children. We searched major trial registries and databases up to 1 December 2017, with no language restrictions. We included randomised controlled trials comparing pre-autumn interventions with usual care in children aged 18 years or younger. Standard Cochrane methods were used for study selection, data extraction, and bias assessment. The primary outcome was the proportion of children experiencing an asthma exacerbation requiring hospitalisation or oral corticosteroids during autumn. Of 546 trials screened, five met the inclusion criteria, enrolling 14,252 children. All studies were conducted in the Northern Hemisphere. Three interventions used leukotriene receptor antagonists, one used omalizumab or an inhaled corticosteroid boost, and the largest study (12,179 children) used a medication reminder letter. Although individual studies generally had low risk of bias, the evidence quality was downgraded due to imprecision, inconsistency, and indirect outcome measurement. Only one US study involving 513 children with asthma and allergic sensitisation reported data for the primary outcome. In this study, exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids or hospitalisation within 90 days of school return were reduced to 11.3% in the omalizumab group compared with 21.0% in the placebo group. The other studies used different exacerbation definitions. A pooled analysis of two leukotriene receptor antagonist trials found no effect on exacerbations, and the reminder-letter intervention did not reduce unscheduled respiratory healthcare contacts between September and December. Four studies reported adverse events, with no evidence of differences between intervention and usual care groups. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were not possible due to insufficient data. Seasonal omalizumab treatment starting four to six weeks before school return may reduce autumn asthma exacerbations, with no increase in adverse effects aside from injection site pain, although the treatment is costly. There was no evidence regarding effects on asthma control, quality of life, or mortality. Future trials should clearly define exacerbations, standardise outcome measures, and carefully characterise participants to allow analysis of subgroup effects.","Asthma is a long-term condition affecting the lungs. It is the most common long-term condition affecting children. One in 11 children in the United Kingdom have asthma. People with asthma can experience asthma 'attacks' of coughing, wheezing, and difficulty breathing. Each year there is a peak in asthma attacks after school restarts in autumn. The likely reason for this is that children are exposed to more viruses that can trigger asthma. Children may also have taken their regular medication less consistently with the break in routine over the summer. As this increase in attacks at the start of the school year is predictable, and the reason for it is somewhat understood, it might be preventable. Approaches to reducing autumn asthma attacks include using extra medications when school restarts or medication reminders during the school holiday. Our searches found 546 trials, of which five were relevant. In total, 14,252 children were randomly assigned to receive either an intervention targeting autumn asthma attacks or usual care. Four small studies (approximately 200 to 1200 children in each) gave children extra asthma medication; these additional medications were omalizumab, leukotriene receptor antagonist tablets, or increased doses of inhaled steroids. One study sent a medication reminder letter over the summer holidays to parents of children with asthma. One trial gave children either omalizumab or placebo. Omalizumab is an antibody designed to alter the immune response. It was given by injection regularly over four to six weeks before school return (i.e. over the bulk of the summer holidays). The children in this study had known allergic asthma. The study showed that omalizumab might reduce autumn attacks. Eleven per cent of those receiving omalizumab had an asthma attack during the first 90 days compared to 21% of those receiving placebo. Three studies used leukotriene receptor antagonist tablets, either montelukast or pranlukast. Although the results of one study suggested that seasonal montelukast might reduce autumn attacks, there was no evidence of reduced attacks in the other two later trials, including a second larger trial of montelukast. There was no evidence that sending a reminder letter reduces the number of children requiring an unplanned healthcare contact. No study provided evidence that the total number of children experiencing adverse events was greater in the intervention than in the usual care group. Our findings were limited by the small numbers of studies identified and because these studies used different interventions and definitions of asthma exacerbations. Further research is needed to better understand how to prevent seasonal attacks, including interventions suitable for children with mild asthma, where expensive and painful treatments are not justified.",1078,"asthma exacerbations, school-aged children, pharmacological interventions, leukotriene receptor antagonists, omalizumab, inhaled corticosteroid, autumn asthma exacerbations, oral corticosteroids, randomised controlled trials, seasonal omalizumab treatment",What was the study trying to examine regarding autumn asthma exacerbations in children?,What methods were used in selecting studies and analyzing data on asthma interventions?,What were the results found regarding the effectiveness of omalizumab on autumn asthma exacerbations?
bl61,finetuned_6,Ivermectin for preventing and treating COVID-19,"Ivermectin, an antiparasitic agent, inhibits the replication of viruses in vitro, and the molecular hypothesis of its antiviral mode of action suggests an inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2 replication in early stages of infection, although current evidence on ivermectin for prevention of infection and treatment of COVID-19 is conflicting. The objective was to assess the efficacy and safety of ivermectin plus standard of care compared to standard of care plus or minus placebo, or any other proven intervention, for people with COVID-19 receiving inpatient or outpatient treatment, and for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection as postexposure prophylaxis. We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, Web of Science, WHO COVID-19 Global literature, and the HTA database weekly without language restrictions to 16 December 2021, and additionally included trials with more than 1000 participants up to April 2022. We included randomized controlled trials comparing ivermectin to standard of care, placebo, or another proven intervention for treatment of confirmed COVID-19, irrespective of disease severity or setting, and for prevention of infection, with co-interventions required to be the same in both groups; in this update we reappraised eligible trials for research integrity, including only prospectively registered RCTs according to WHO guidelines. We assessed RCTs for bias using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool and used GRADE to rate certainty of evidence for outcomes in inpatients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19, outpatients with mild COVID-19, and for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We excluded seven of the 14 trials from the previous review because six were not prospectively registered and one was non-randomized; the updated review includes 11 trials with 3409 participants investigating ivermectin plus standard of care compared to standard of care plus or minus placebo. No trial investigated ivermectin for prevention or compared it to an intervention with proven efficacy. Five trials treated moderate COVID-19 in inpatient settings and six treated mild COVID-19 in outpatient settings; eight trials were double-blind and placebo-controlled, and three were open-label, with around 50% of results assessed as low risk of bias. We identified 31 ongoing trials and 28 potentially eligible trials without published results or with reporting disparities, held in awaiting classification until authors clarify details. For treating moderate-to-severe inpatient COVID-19, we are uncertain whether ivermectin plus standard of care reduces or increases all-cause mortality at 28 days (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.14 to 2.51; 3 trials, 230 participants; very low-certainty evidence), clinical worsening measured by new need for ventilation or death (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.33 to 2.04; 2 trials, 118 participants; very low-certainty evidence), or serious adverse events (RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.07 to 35.89; 2 trials, 197 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Ivermectin plus standard of care may have little or no effect on clinical improvement measured by discharge alive at day 28 (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.35; 1 trial, 73 participants; low-certainty evidence), on any adverse events during the trial (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.79; 3 trials, 228 participants; low-certainty evidence), and on viral clearance at seven days (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.58; 3 trials, 231 participants; low-certainty evidence); no trial investigated quality of life. For treating outpatients with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19, ivermectin plus standard of care probably has little or no effect on all-cause mortality at day 28 (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.25; 6 trials, 2860 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and little or no effect on quality of life measured with the PROMIS Global-10 scale (physical and mental component MD 0.00, 95% CI ranges crossing 0; 1358 participants; high-certainty evidence). Ivermectin may have little or no effect on clinical worsening measured by hospital admission or death (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.20 to 6.02; 2 trials, 590 participants; low-certainty evidence), clinical improvement measured by resolution of symptoms by day 14 (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.36; 2 trials, 478 participants; low-certainty evidence), serious adverse events (RR 2.27, 95% CI 0.62 to 8.31; 5 trials, 1502 participants; low-certainty evidence), any adverse events (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.76; 5 trials, 1502 participants; low-certainty evidence), and viral clearance at day 7 (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.48; 2 trials, 331 participants; low-certainty evidence); no trials reporting duration of symptoms were eligible for meta-analysis. For outpatients, there is currently low- to high-certainty evidence that ivermectin has no beneficial effect for people with COVID-19, and based on very low-certainty evidence for inpatients, we remain uncertain whether ivermectin prevents death or clinical worsening or increases serious adverse events, while low-certainty evidence suggests no beneficial effect on clinical improvement, viral clearance, or adverse events; no evidence is available for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this update, certainty increased due to higher-quality trials with more participants, and according to the living review approach, searches will continue to be updated.","Ivermectin is a medicine used to treat parasites, such as intestinal parasites in animals and scabies in humans, and is inexpensive and widely used where parasitic infestations are common, with few unwanted effects; medical regulators have not approved ivermectin for COVID-19. We wanted to update our knowledge of whether ivermectin reduces death, illness, and length of infection in people with COVID-19, or is useful in prevention, and included trials comparing the medicine to placebo, usual care, or treatments known to work to some extent such as dexamethasone, while excluding trials comparing ivermectin to medicines that do not work, like hydroxychloroquine, or whose effectiveness is uncertain. We evaluated effects of ivermectin in infected people on people dying, whether COVID-19 got better or worse, quality of life, serious and non-serious unwanted effects, and viral clearance; for prevention, we sought effects on preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease. We searched for randomized controlled trials investigating ivermectin to prevent or treat COVID-19, requiring laboratory-confirmed infections for hospital or outpatient participants, and in this update also investigated trustworthiness of trials, including them only if they fulfilled clear ethical and scientific criteria; we compared and summarized results and rated confidence in the evidence based on common criteria such as trial methods and sizes. We excluded seven of the 14 trials from the previous review as they did not fulfil expected criteria, and with four new trials included 11 trials with 3409 participants investigating ivermectin with usual care compared with the same usual care or placebo; for treatment, five trials were in hospital with moderate COVID-19 and six trials in outpatients with mild COVID-19, using different doses and treatment durations, and no trial investigated ivermectin for prevention; we also found 31 ongoing trials and 28 additional trials requiring clarification or not yet published. Treating people in hospital with COVID-19, we do not know whether ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment leads to more or fewer deaths, worsens or improves condition measured by need for ventilation or death, or increases or reduces serious unwanted events; ivermectin may make little or no difference to improving condition measured by discharge or to non-serious unwanted events, and seven days after treatment may make little or no difference to reduction of negative tests. Treating outpatients with COVID-19, ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment probably makes little or no difference to people dying and makes little or no difference to quality of life; it may make little or no difference to worsening condition measured by admission or death, serious unwanted events, non-serious unwanted events, improvement of symptoms in 14 days, or negative tests at seven days. Our confidence in the evidence, especially for outpatients, improved since the last review because more participants were included in high-quality trials, and although we are quite certain about risk of dying and quality of life, confidence is still low for many other outcomes because few events were measured, methods differed, and not all relevant outcomes were reported.",1109,"Ivermectin, randomized controlled trials, standard of care, Cochrane RoB 2 tool, GRADE, SARS-CoV-2 infection, clinical improvement, viral clearance, adverse events, all-cause mortality",What was the main objective of the study regarding the use of ivermectin in COVID-19 patients?,What methods did the researchers use to gather and assess the data in this study?,What were the key findings on the efficacy of ivermectin in treating COVID-19 according to this study?
bl61,finetuned_6,Prophylactic antibiotic therapy for people with chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD),"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; including chronic bronchitis and emphysema) is a chronic respiratory condition characterised by shortness of breath, cough and recurrent exacerbations. Long-term antibiotic use may reduce both bacterial load and inflammation in the airways. Studies have shown a reduction of exacerbations with antibiotics in comparison to placebo in people with COPD, but there are concerns about antibiotic resistance and safety. To compare the safety and efficacy of different classes of antibiotics (continuous, intermittent or pulsed) for prophylaxis of exacerbations in patients with COPD.
We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Trials Register and bibliographies of relevant studies. The latest literature search was conducted on 6 February 2019.
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were selected that compared one prophylactic antibiotic with another in patients with COPD.
We used the standard Cochrane methods. Two independent review authors selected trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Discrepancies were resolved by involving a third review author.
We included two RCTs, both published in 2015 involving a total of 391 participants with treatment duration of 12 to 13 weeks. One RCT compared a quinolone (moxifloxacin pulsed, for 5 days every 4 weeks), with a tetracycline (doxycycline continuous) or a macrolide (azithromycin intermittent). The second RCT compared a tetracycline (doxycycline continuous) plus a macrolide (roxithromycin continuous), with roxithromycin (continuous) alone. The trials recruited participants with a mean age of 68 years, with moderate-severity COPD. Both trials included participants who had between two and five exacerbations in the previous one to two years. In one trial, 17% of patients had previously been using inhaled corticosteroids. In the other study, all patients were positive for Chlamydophila pneumoniae (C pneumoniae). Overall, we judged the evidence presented to be of very low-certainty, mainly due to imprecision, but we also had concerns about indirectness and methodological quality of the included studies. The primary outcome measures for this review included exacerbations, quality of life, drug resistance and serious adverse events. Macrolide + tetracycline versus macrolide There was no clear difference between treatments in improvement in quality of life as assessed by the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ). The CRQ scale ranges from 0 to 10 and higher scores on the scale indicate better quality of life. CRQ sub-scales for dyspnoea (mean difference (MD) 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.84 to 2.00; 187 participants; very low-certainty evidence), fatigue (MD 0.02, 95% CI -1.08 to 1.12; 187 participants; very low-certainty evidence), emotional function (MD -0.37, 95% CI -1.74 to 1.00; 187 participants; very low-certainty evidence), or mastery (MD -0.79, 95% CI -1.86 to 0.28; 187 participants; very low-certainty evidence) at 12 weeks. For serious adverse events, it was uncertain if there was a difference between combined roxithromycin and doxycycline versus roxithromycin alone at 48 weeks follow-up after active treatment of 12 weeks (odds ratio (OR) 1.00, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.93; 198 participants; very low-certainty evidence). There were five deaths reported in the combined treatment arm, versus three in the single treatment arm at 48 weeks follow-up after active treatment of 12 weeks (OR 1.63, 95% CI 0.38 to 7.02; 198 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Quinolone versus tetracycline There was no clear difference between moxifloxacin and doxycycline for the number of participants experiencing one or more exacerbations (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.38; 50 participants, very low-certainty evidence) at 13 weeks. There were no serious adverse events or deaths reported in either treatment groups. We did not identify any evidence for our other primary outcomes. Quinolone versus macrolide There was no clear difference between moxifloxacin and azithromycin for the number of participants experiencing one or more exacerbations (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.32 to 3.10; 50 participants; very low-certainty evidence) at 13 weeks. There were no serious adverse events or deaths reported in either treatment groups. We did not identify any evidence for our other primary outcomes. Marcolide versus tetracycline There was no clear difference between azithromycin and doxycycline for the number of participants experiencing one or more exacerbations (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.38; 50 participants; very low-certainty evidence) at 13 weeks. There were no serious adverse events or deaths reported in either treatment groups. We did not identify any evidence for our other primary outcomes. We did not find head-to-head evidence for impact of antibiotics on drug resistance. It is not clear from the evidence included in this review whether there is a difference in efficacy or safety between different classes or regimens of prophylactic antibiotic, given for 12 to 13 weeks to people with COPD. Whilst no head-to-head comparisons of antibiotic resistance were identified, concerns about this continue. The sample size in this review is small and both included studies are of short duration. Thus, there is considerable uncertainty in effects observed and the effects of different prophylactic antibiotics requires further research.","COPD is a common condition caused mainly by smoking and can lead to long-term breathing problems. Symptoms include shortness of breath, and cough with sputum production due to airways and lung damage. Infection can trigger severe symptoms, with breathing becoming worse and increased cough and sputum. This is more commonly known as an exacerbation or 'flare-up' which can cause further damage to lung function. Frequent exacerbations can lead to hospital admissions, reduced quality of life, and increase the risk of death.
We wanted to know whether one preventative antibiotic was better than another preventative antibiotic in reducing exacerbations, and improving quality of life for people with COPD.
We found two randomised trials, including 391 people with COPD. The participants had an average age of 68 years. The first study included three groups of COPD patients taking either moxifloxacin (daily for 5 days every 4 weeks), doxycycline (daily for 13 weeks) or azithromycin (3 times per week for 13 weeks). The second study investigated the use of doxycycline (daily) in addition to roxithromycin (daily) for 12 weeks in COPD. Our main outcomes were number of exacerbations, quality of life, serious side effects (known as 'adverse events') and antibiotic resistance.
Overall, we were unable to determine any difference between one antibiotic compared with each other in improving the main outcomes we measured.
We were unclear whether one antibiotic was better or worse than another in terms of reducing exacerbations or improving quality of life. Neither of the studies reported a comparison between antibiotics for drug resistance.
In one study lasting 13 weeks we found no serious side effects of taking moxifloxacin, azithromycin or doxycycline, and no deaths were reported. In the other study, very similar numbers of people experienced serious side effects in both the combined antibiotic and single antibiotic treatment groups after 12 weeks of treatment and 48 weeks of follow-up. However, the numbers were small so we are not sure if one treatment option may cause more side effects than the other. In the same study, five people in the combined treatment group died, compared to three people in the single treatment group. Again, these numbers are too small to draw any conclusions.
We were very uncertain about the results due to finding only two small studies that gave people with COPD antibiotics for only 12 or 13 weeks. The studies only looked at four different antibiotics and did not measure all the things we were interested in.",1080,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), exacerbations, antibiotic resistance, prophylactic antibiotic, risk of bias, Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), macrolide, tetracycline, quinolone, Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ).",What was the main objective of the study regarding the use of antibiotics in COPD patients?,What methods were utilized in the study to select and assess the trials included?,What were the key findings and results regarding the efficacy and safety of different antibiotic regimens in the study?
bl61,finetuned_6,Fixed-dose combination drug therapy for the prevention of heart disease and stroke,"Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) remains the leading cause of death and disability worldwide, yet many people still do not receive adequate treatment to control their risk factors. One strategy proposed to help address this gap is the use of a fixed-dose combination pill�often called a �polypill��that combines blood pressure-lowering drugs, cholesterol-lowering medication, and sometimes antiplatelet therapy into a single tablet taken daily. This review evaluated whether such fixed-dose combination therapy leads to fewer deaths, fewer heart attacks and strokes, improved adherence to medication, and better control of cardiovascular risk factors compared with usual care, placebo, or taking medications separately. We included 13 randomised controlled trials involving a total of 9059 adults; four of these trials were new additions in this update. Most studies involved people without established ASCVD, and follow-up ranged from six weeks to nearly two years. Participants were generally in their early 60s, and about one-third were women. Newer studies tended to be larger, longer, and had a lower risk of bias. However, a major limitation across all trials was the inability to blind participants or researchers to the treatment since the fixed-dose pill differs visibly from usual care, which could influence reported outcomes. Overall, the effects of fixed-dose combination therapy on important clinical outcomes, such as death or major cardiovascular events, remain uncertain. About 1% of participants in both the fixed-dose and control groups died during the trials, showing no clear difference (risk ratio 1.10, 95% confidence interval 0.64 to 1.89). Similarly, the proportion of people who experienced a heart attack or stroke was small (4.7% in the fixed-dose group versus 3.7% in the control group), and the evidence did not show a clear effect (risk ratio 1.26, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.66). These findings are limited by the low number of events and the fact that most trials focused on risk factor changes rather than long-term outcomes. Side effects occurred commonly in both groups, but people taking the fixed-dose pill were somewhat more likely to report an adverse event (32% versus 27%), meaning a 16% increased risk. This is not unexpected since the polypill combines several medications known to cause side effects individually. Despite this, the fixed-dose combination showed consistent improvements in risk factor control. On average, systolic blood pressure was lowered by about 6 mmHg compared with usual care, and LDL cholesterol dropped by approximately 0.70 mmol/L. Total cholesterol also decreased modestly. However, these results showed substantial statistical variation between trials, so they should be interpreted cautiously. A key advantage of fixed-dose combination therapy was improved medication adherence. Across four studies, adherence to treatment was 44% higher among participants taking the polypill than among those receiving usual care. This suggests that simplifying treatment into a single pill may help more people take their medications consistently. In summary, while fixed-dose combination therapy improves blood pressure, cholesterol, and adherence, current evidence is insufficient to determine whether it reduces heart attacks, strokes, or deaths. Most trials were not designed or powered to assess these major outcomes, which likely explains the lack of clear effects. Fixed-dose therapy does appear to increase minor side effects but may help patients stay on treatment better. Ongoing and longer-term studies will be critical to determine whether the improvements in risk factors observed with polypill therapy eventually translate into meaningful reductions in cardiovascular events.","We examined the evidence on whether using fixed-dose combination drug therapy can help prevent heart attacks and strokes. This approach combines several medications�typically drugs that lower blood pressure and cholesterol�into a single pill. We identified 13 studies involving 9059 adults. The evidence is current up to September 2016. Researchers wanted to know if taking multiple preventive medications in a single pill was better or worse than usual care, placebo, or taking each drug separately. This updated review includes studies published since the previous Cochrane Review from 2014. Four of the included studies involved people who already had a previous heart attack or stroke, or who were at high risk of having one. Five studies followed participants for 12 months or longer. Most of the participants were middle-aged men with moderately high blood pressure or cholesterol levels, and two studies specifically included large numbers of Aboriginal or M?ori participants. The fixed-dose pills in these trials contained between two and five medications, but all combinations included at least one drug to lower blood pressure and one to lower cholesterol. A major limitation across studies was that neither the participants nor the researchers could be blinded to the treatment, which could influence the results. The findings showed that it is still uncertain whether fixed-dose combination therapy reduces the risk of death, heart attacks, or strokes. Very few participants in the trials experienced these events�less than 5%�making it difficult to determine the true effect. The comparison with usual care also provided low-quality evidence, meaning confidence in these results is limited. Participants taking fixed-dose combination pills experienced more side effects compared with those in the control groups (32% versus 27%). This is expected because the medications involved�such as aspirin, blood pressure-lowering drugs, and cholesterol-lowering drugs�are known to cause side effects when taken individually. The combined pill may slightly reduce blood pressure by about 6 mmHg and lower LDL cholesterol by approximately 0.6 mmol/L, though these benefits were not seen consistently across all studies. Importantly, fixed-dose combination therapy did improve how regularly people took their preventive medications, suggesting better adherence overall. The overall quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to low, meaning that while some findings are fairly reliable, others remain uncertain. Ongoing and future clinical trials using fixed-dose combination therapy are expected to provide clearer evidence about its impact on major outcomes such as heart attacks, strokes, and deaths.",1048,"Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, fixed-dose combination therapy, polypill, blood pressure-lowering drugs, cholesterol-lowering medication, antiplatelet therapy, randomised controlled trials, cardiovascular risk factors, major cardiovascular events, medication adherence.",What was the focus of the study concerning the effects of the fixed-dose combination pill on ASCVD?,What methods were employed in the study to evaluate the outcomes of fixed-dose combination therapy?,What were the key results regarding the impact of fixed-dose combination therapy on clinical outcomes such as heart attacks and strokes?
yikunh2@illinois.edu,static_1,Do physical measures such as hand-washing or wearing masks stop or slow down the spread of respiratory viruses?,"Viral epidemics or pandemics of acute respiratory infections (ARIs) pose a global threat, such as the influenza (H1N1) pandemic in 2009 caused by the H1N1pdm09 virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 in 2019, and antiviral drugs and vaccines may be insufficient to prevent their spread; this is an update of a Cochrane Review last published in 2020 and includes results from studies conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. The objective was to assess the effectiveness of physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of acute respiratory viruses. We searched CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and two trials registers in October 2022, with backward and forward citation analysis. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-RCTs investigating physical interventions (screening at entry ports, isolation, quarantine, physical distancing, personal protection, hand hygiene, face masks, glasses, and gargling) to prevent respiratory virus transmission, and used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We included 11 new RCTs and cluster-RCTs (610,872 participants), bringing the total to 78; six were conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic (two from Mexico, and one each from Denmark, Bangladesh, England, and Norway), and we identified four ongoing studies, one completed but unreported, evaluating masks during COVID-19. Many studies were conducted during non-epidemic influenza periods, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, or influenza seasons up to 2016, meaning many occurred under lower viral circulation compared with COVID-19; settings varied widely, from suburban schools to hospital wards in high-income countries, crowded inner-city areas in low-income countries, and an immigrant neighbourhood in a high-income country, and adherence to interventions was low in many studies, with risk of bias mostly high or unclear. We included 12 trials comparing medical/surgical masks versus no masks (two in healthcare workers and 10 in the community); wearing masks in the community probably makes little or no difference in influenza-like illness/COVID-like illness compared to not wearing masks (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.09; 9 trials, 276,917 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and probably makes little or no difference in laboratory-confirmed influenza/SARS-CoV-2 (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.42; 6 trials, 13,919 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), with harms rarely measured. For N95/P2 respirators compared to medical/surgical masks, pooled trials (four in healthcare settings and one in a household) show very uncertain effects on clinical respiratory illness (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.10; 3 trials, 7779 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and they may be effective for ILI (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.03; 5 trials, 8407 participants; low-certainty evidence); for laboratory-confirmed influenza, N95/P2 respirators probably make little or no difference (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.34; 5 trials, 8407 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Restricting analyses to healthcare workers made no difference; harms were poorly measured, though discomfort was reported. One recently published RCT found medical/surgical masks non-inferior to N95 respirators in 1009 healthcare workers across four countries treating COVID-19 patients. For hand hygiene, 19 trials compared interventions with controls across schools, childcare centres, and homes; hand hygiene resulted in a 14% relative reduction in ARIs (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.90; 9 trials, 52,105 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), reducing cases from 380 to 327 per 1000 people. For ILI (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.09; 11 trials, 34,503 participants; low-certainty evidence) and laboratory-confirmed influenza (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.30; 8 trials, 8332 participants; low-certainty evidence), effects suggested little or no difference. Pooled data from 19 trials (71,210 participants) for ARI/ILI/influenza found hand hygiene may be beneficial with an 11% relative reduction (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.94; low-certainty evidence), though with high heterogeneity; harms were rarely reported. No RCTs were found for gowns and gloves, face shields, or screening at entry ports. The high risk of bias, variation in outcome measurement, and low adherence hinder firm conclusions; additional RCTs during the pandemic existed but were relatively few despite the importance of evaluating masking and adherence, especially in vulnerable groups. There remains uncertainty about the effects of face masks, with low to moderate certainty meaning confidence is limited and true effects may differ; pooled RCTs did not show a clear reduction in respiratory viral infection with medical/surgical masks, and no clear difference was seen between medical/surgical masks and N95/P2 respirators in healthcare workers providing routine care. Hand hygiene is likely to modestly reduce respiratory illness, though not significantly for ILI or laboratory-confirmed influenza. Harms were under-investigated. There is a need for large, well-designed RCTs across multiple settings and populations to evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions and the impact of adherence, especially among those at highest risk of ARIs.","Respiratory viruses are viruses that infect the cells in your airways � nose, throat, and lungs � and these infections can cause serious problems and affect normal breathing, leading to illnesses such as flu (influenza), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and COVID-19. People infected with a respiratory virus spread virus particles into the air when they cough or sneeze, and others become infected if they come into contact with these particles in the air or on surfaces; respiratory viruses can spread quickly through communities, populations, countries (causing epidemics), and around the world (causing pandemics). Physical measures to try to prevent respiratory viruses spreading include washing hands often; not touching your eyes, nose, or mouth; sneezing or coughing into your elbow; wiping surfaces with disinfectant; wearing masks, eye protection, gloves, and gowns; avoiding contact with other people (isolation or quarantine); keeping a distance from others; and screening people entering a country for signs of infection. We wanted to find out whether physical measures stop or slow the spread of respiratory viruses from well-controlled randomised controlled trials comparing one intervention to another. We searched for randomised controlled studies that looked at physical measures to stop people acquiring a respiratory virus infection and were interested in how many people caught a respiratory virus infection and whether the physical measures had unwanted effects. We identified 78 relevant studies conducted in low-, middle-, and high-income countries in hospitals, schools, homes, offices, childcare centres, and communities during non-epidemic influenza periods, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, influenza seasons up to 2016, and during the COVID-19 pandemic; five ongoing, unpublished studies were found, two evaluating masks for COVID-19, with five trials funded by government and pharmaceutical companies, and nine funded by pharmaceutical companies. No studies looked at face shields, gowns and gloves, or screening at borders. We assessed the effects of medical or surgical masks, N95/P2 respirators (close-fitting masks filtering inhaled air, mostly used by healthcare workers), and hand hygiene (hand-washing or hand sanitiser). For medical or surgical masks, ten studies took place in the community and two in healthcare workers; compared with wearing no mask (community studies only), wearing a mask may make little to no difference in how many people caught a flu-like or COVID-like illness (9 studies; 276,917 people), and probably makes little or no difference in how many had flu or COVID confirmed by a lab test (6 studies; 13,919 people), with discomfort rarely reported. For N95/P2 respirators, four studies were in healthcare workers and one small study in the community; compared with wearing surgical masks, N95/P2 respirators probably make little to no difference in confirmed flu (5 studies; 8407 people) and may make little to no difference in flu-like illness (5 studies; 8407 people) or respiratory illness (3 studies; 7799 people), with discomfort mentioned. For hand hygiene, following a hand hygiene programme may reduce respiratory or flu-like illness or confirmed flu compared with no programme (19 studies; 71,210 people), although the reduction was not statistically confirmed when ILI and lab-confirmed ILI were analysed separately; few studies measured unwanted effects, with skin irritation from sanitiser mentioned. Our confidence in these results is generally low to moderate for subjective outcomes such as respiratory illness, but moderate for more precise laboratory-confirmed infection outcomes related to masks and N95/P2 respirators; results may change with more evidence, and adherence to mask-wearing and hand hygiene was relatively low, which may have affected study outcomes.",1111,"acute respiratory infections, randomized controlled trials, physical interventions, face masks, hand hygiene, viral epidemics, N95/P2 respirators, laboratory-confirmed influenza, SARS-CoV-2, adherence",What was the objective of the study?,What methods and procedures did the study employ to gather data?,What were the findings regarding the effectiveness of hand hygiene and face masks in reducing respiratory infections?
yikunh2@illinois.edu,static_1,Is liraglutide an effective weight-loss treatment for adults living with obesity and does it cause unwanted effects?,"To assess the effects of liraglutide, a GLP-1RA, for adults living with obesity, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and two trials registries on 17 December 2024. Liraglutide likely increases the proportion of people achieving at least 5% weight loss at medium-term follow-up; this effect is likely to be sustained at longer-term follow-up. Medium- or long-term impact on percentage weight change, MACE, quality of life, and mortality may be limited or uncertain. Liraglutide may lead to an increase in adverse events, including serious adverse events in both the medium and long term, which might further limit the sustainability of the initial effects. The drug manufacturer funded 22 studies, raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest. Further independent and long-term studies are needed to better understand the broader effects of liraglutide in the management of obesity.","Obesity is a long-term condition in which a person has too much body fat. It can increase the risk of health problems like type 2 diabetes, diseases of the heart and blood vessels (cardiovascular disease), and some types of cancer. Obesity levels are increasing worldwide, placing a significant burden on healthcare systems. Managing obesity usually involves lifestyle changes such as eating a healthier diet and being more physically active. However, many people find these changes difficult to maintain, and doctors may prescribe medications to support weight loss. Liraglutide is a type of medication that helps people feel full sooner, and so eat less. It was originally developed to treat type 2 diabetes but has been approved in many countries to help people lose weight. It is given as a daily injection. Some people taking liraglutide experience unwanted effects, such as feeling or being sick, diarrhoea and constipation. Liraglutide is a �GLP-1 receptor agonist� (GLP-1RA). Similar medications include semaglutide and tirzepatide. We wanted to know how well liraglutide works in adults with obesity in the medium term (6 to 24 months) and long term (24 months or more). We examined its effects on weight, unwanted effects, obesity-related health problems, quality of life and risk of death. We did not look at what happens after people stop taking liraglutide. We searched for studies that investigated liraglutide for adults living with obesity. Studies could investigate any dose of liraglutide compared with placebo (sham medication), no treatment, lifestyle changes or another weight-loss medication. We included studies in which people took liraglutide for at least 6 months. We compared and analysed the results and assessed our confidence in the evidence. We found 24 studies with 9937 men and women with obesity, aged between 31 and 64 years. Some people had weight-related conditions like diabetes or liver disease. Most studies compared liraglutide with placebo. They mainly took place in high- and middle-income countries. People who took liraglutide were more likely to lose at least 5% of their body weight than those who took a placebo in the medium (18 studies, 6651 people) and long term (2 studies, 1262 people). However, we are uncertain about liraglutide�s effects on people�s overall percentage weight change from the beginning of the study to the medium term (16 studies, 6050 people) and there may be little to no difference in percentage weight change in the long term (2 studies, 1262 people). In the medium term, people taking liraglutide might experience more unwanted effects of any kind (16 studies, 8147 people) and more serious unwanted effects (20 studies, 8487 people) than those taking placebo. We are unsure about mild-to-moderate unwanted effects (17 studies, 7440 people) or whether unwanted effects caused people to stop treatment (19 studies, 8628 people). In the long term (2 studies, 2640 participants), liraglutide may increase unwanted effects and people may be more likely to stop treatment because of them. We are unsure about unwanted events overall and mild-to-moderate unwanted effects. Liraglutide probably makes little or no difference to quality of life both in the medium term (6 studies, 3733 people) and in the long term (1 study, 863 people). Liraglutide probably makes little or no difference to major cardiovascular events in the medium term (6 studies, 5762 people). We are unsure about its effects on major cardiovascular events in the long term and on deaths in the medium and long term. We are moderately confident that people taking liraglutide lose more weight than those taking placebo. However, our confidence in the other evidence is limited because of how the studies were conducted and information that was missing. Few studies looked at long-term effects or included different people from different places, so the results may not apply to everyone. The manufacturers of liraglutide were involved in the design, conduct or analysis of 22 of the 24 studies, which limits our confidence in the results. More independent studies are needed.",1101,"Liraglutide, GLP-1RA, obesity, weight loss, adverse events, medium-term follow-up, long-term follow-up, percentage weight change, MACE, quality of life",What was the study trying to examine regarding the effects of liraglutide in adults living with obesity?,What methods or sources were used to gather data for the study on liraglutide?,What were the findings of the study in terms of weight loss and adverse events associated with liraglutide?
yikunh2@illinois.edu,static_1,"Thymic peptides for treatment of cancer patients in addition to chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or both","Purified thymus extracts (pTE) and synthetic thymic peptides (sTP) are thought to enhance the immune system of cancer patients to help fight tumour growth and reduce infections caused by disease-related or treatment-related immunosuppression. This review evaluated the effectiveness of pTE and sTP for cancer management. Researchers searched major medical databases up to February 2010 for randomized trials in adult cancer patients where pTE or sTP were added to chemotherapy or radiotherapy and compared with the same regimen alone or with placebo. Data were independently extracted by two authors, and odds ratios were calculated for overall survival, disease-free survival, tumour response, and adverse effects. A random-effects model was used. Twenty-six trials involving 2736 patients were identified: 20 trials investigated pTE (thymostimulin or thymosin fraction 5) and six investigated sTP (thymopentin or thymosin ?1). Twenty-one trials reported overall survival, six reported disease-free survival, 14 reported tumour response, nine reported adverse effects, and 10 reported safety. Adding pTE showed no benefit for overall survival (RR 1.00), disease-free survival (RR 0.97), or tumour response (RR 1.07), with moderate to high heterogeneity. For thymosin ?1, the pooled RR for overall survival was 1.21 and for disease-free survival was 3.37, though neither result reached statistical significance. pTE reduced the risk of severe infectious complications (RR 0.54), and thymostimulin showed a non-significant trend toward reduced severe neutropenia. Both pTE and sTP were generally well tolerated. Many trials had at least moderate risk of bias. Overall, there is no clear evidence that adding pTE to cancer treatment improves survival or tumour response, although thymosin ?1 showed a possible trend toward benefit. There is preliminary evidence that pTE may reduce severe infectious complications during chemotherapy or radiotherapy.","The immune system plays a key role in the body�s own defences against cancer cells. The thymus gland plays a central part in this and modifies T-cells, a subset of lymphocytes. Studies with thymic peptides have shown a variety of effects on the immune system. There are two groups of thymic peptides available for use in treatment: purified extracts from animal (mostly calf) thymus glands and synthetically produced thymus gland peptides.
This review aims to answer the question whether having thymic peptides can improve the response to and tolerability of standard chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or combined treatment. Further questions are whether the peptides inhibit or reduce the progression and recurrence of disease, whether they prolong the life of cancer patients and whether quality of life is improved. This review looked at the evidence from 26 clinical trials with a total of 2736 adult cancer patients. Many of the trials were small and of moderate quality. Only three studies were less than 10 years old. Thymosin ?1 is a synthetic peptide that shows some promise as a treatment option for patients with metastatic melanoma when used in addition to chemotherapy. Severe problems occur during chemotherapy and radiotherapy due to low white blood cell counts and infections. These were reduced by using purified thymus extracts. However, the use of purified thymus extracts should be investigated more thoroughly before the extracts are used routinely in patients. The findings were not conclusive and caution is advised. Overall, thymic peptides seem to be well tolerated.",1021,"purified thymus extracts, synthetic thymic peptides, thymosin ?1, overall survival, disease-free survival, tumour response, severe infectious complications, risk of bias, random-effects model, chemotherapy",What was the primary objective of the study in relation to pTE and sTP for cancer management?,"What methods did the study employ to evaluate the effectiveness of pTE and sTP, including the type of trials and the data extraction process?","What were the main findings regarding the impact of pTE and sTP on overall survival, disease-free survival, tumor response, and adverse effects?"
yikunh2@illinois.edu,static_1,Low-carbohydrate diets or balanced-carbohydrate diets: which works better for weight loss and heart disease risks?,"Debates on effective and safe diets for managing obesity in adults are ongoing. Low-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets (also known as 'low-carb diets') continue to be widely promoted, marketed and commercialised as being more effective for weight loss, and healthier, than 'balanced'-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets. To compare the effects of low-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets to weight-reducing diets with balanced ranges of carbohydrates, in relation to changes in weight and cardiovascular risk, in overweight and obese adults without and with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We searched MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase (Ovid), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Web of Science Core Collection (Clarivate Analytics), ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to 25 June 2021, and screened reference lists of included trials and relevant systematic reviews. Language or publication restrictions were not applied. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in adults (18 years+) who were overweight or living with obesity, without or with T2DM, and without or with cardiovascular conditions or risk factors. Trials had to compare low-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets to balanced-carbohydrate (45% to 65% of total energy (TE)) weight-reducing diets, have a weight-reducing phase of 2 weeks or longer and be explicitly implemented for the primary purpose of reducing weight, with or without advice to restrict energy intake. Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts and full?text articles to determine eligibility; and independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias using RoB 2 and assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. We stratified analyses by participants without and with T2DM, and by diets with weight-reducing phases only and those with weight-reducing phases followed by weight-maintenance phases. Primary outcomes were change in body weight (kg) and the number of participants per group with weight loss of at least 5%, assessed at short- (three months to < 12 months) and long-term (? 12 months) follow-up. We included 61 parallel-arm RCTs that randomised 6925 participants to either low-carbohydrate or balanced-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets. All trials were conducted in high-income countries except for one in China. Most participants (n = 5118 randomised) did not have T2DM. Mean baseline weight across trials was 95 kg (range 66 to 132 kg). Participants with T2DM were older (mean 57 years, range 50 to 65) than those without T2DM (mean 45 years, range 22 to 62). Most trials included men and women (42/61; 3/19 men only; 16/19 women only), and people without baseline cardiovascular conditions, risk factors or events (36/61). Mean baseline diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol across trials were within normal ranges. The longest weight-reducing phase of diets was two years in participants without and with T2DM. Evidence from studies with weight-reducing phases followed by weight-maintenance phases was limited. Most trials investigated low-carbohydrate diets (> 50 g to 150 g per day or < 45% of TE; n = 42), followed by very low (? 50 g per day or < 10% of TE; n = 14), and then incremental increases from very low to low (n = 5). The most common diets compared were low-carbohydrate, balanced-fat (20 to 35% of TE) and high-protein (> 20% of TE) treatment diets versus control diets balanced for the three macronutrients (24/61). In most trials (45/61) the energy prescription or approach used to restrict energy intake was similar in both groups. We assessed the overall risk of bias of outcomes across trials as predominantly high, mostly from bias due to missing outcome data. Using GRADE, we assessed the certainty of evidence as moderate to very low across outcomes. Participants without and with T2DM lost weight when following weight-reducing phases of both diets at the short (range: 12.2 to 0.33 kg) and long term (range: 13.1 to 1.7 kg). In overweight and obese participants without T2DM: low-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets compared to balanced-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets (weight-reducing phases only) probably result in little to no difference in change in body weight over three to 8.5 months (mean difference (MD) ?1.07 kg, (95% confidence interval (CI) ?1.55 to ?0.59, I2 = 51%, 3286 participants, 37 RCTs, moderate-certainty evidence) and over one to two years (MD ?0.93 kg, 95% CI ?1.81 to ?0.04, I2 = 40%, 1805 participants, 14 RCTs, moderate-certainty evidence); as well as change in DBP and LDL cholesterol over one to two years. The evidence is very uncertain about whether there is a difference in the number of participants per group with weight loss of at least 5% at one year (risk ratio (RR) 1.11, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.31, I2 = 17%, 137 participants, 2 RCTs, very low-certainty evidence). In overweight and obese participants with T2DM: low-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets compared to balanced-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets (weight-reducing phases only) probably result in little to no difference in change in body weight over three to six months (MD ?1.26 kg, 95% CI ?2.44 to ?0.09, I2 = 47%, 1114 participants, 14 RCTs, moderate-certainty evidence) and over one to two years (MD ?0.33 kg, 95% CI ?2.13 to 1.46, I2 = 10%, 813 participants, 7 RCTs, moderate-certainty evidence); as well in change in DBP, HbA1c and LDL cholesterol over 1 to 2 years. The evidence is very uncertain about whether there is a difference in the number of participants per group with weight loss of at least 5% at one to two years (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.20, I2 = 0%, 106 participants, 2 RCTs, very low-certainty evidence). Evidence on participant-reported adverse effects was limited, and we could not draw any conclusions about these. There is probably little to no difference in weight reduction and changes in cardiovascular risk factors up to two years' follow-up, when overweight and obese participants without and with T2DM are randomised to either low-carbohydrate or balanced-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets.","What are low-carbohydrate and balanced-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets? People spend lots of money on trying to lose weight using diets, products, foods and books, and continue to debate about which diets are effective and safe. So, examining the scientific evidence behind claims made is important. Low-carbohydrate diets are a broad category of weight-reducing diets that manipulate and restrict carbohydrates, protein and fat in diets. There are no consistent, widely-accepted definitions of these diets and different descriptions are used (such as, 'low-carbohydrate, high-protein�, 'low-carbohydrate, high-fat', or �very low-carbohydrate�). Low-carbohydrate diets are implemented in different ways, but they restrict grains, cereals and legumes, and other carbohydrate-containing foods; such as dairy, most fruit and certain vegetables. These foods are then typically replaced with foods higher in fat and protein; such as meats, eggs, cheese, butter, cream, oils. Some low-carbohydrate diets recommend eating as desired, while others recommend restricting the amount of energy eaten. Balanced-carbohydrate diets contain more moderate amounts of carbohydrates, protein and fats, in line with current healthy eating advice from health authorities. When used for weight reduction, balanced diets recommend restricting the amount of energy eaten by guiding people to reduce their portion sizes and choose healthier foods (e.g. lean instead of fatty meat). Low-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets are widely promoted, marketed and commercialised as being more effective for weight loss, and healthier, than 'balanced'-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets. What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out if low-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets were better for weight loss and heart disease risk factors than balanced-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets in adults who were overweight or living with obesity. We wanted to find this out for people with and without type 2 diabetes. What did we do? We searched six electronic databases and trial registries for all trials* that compared low-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets with balanced-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets in adults who were overweight or living with obesity. The trials had to last for at least three months. We compared and summarised the results of the trials and rated our confidence in the combined evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. *A trial is a type of study in which participants are assigned randomly to two or more treatment groups. This is the best way to ensure similar groups of participants. What did we find? We found 61 trials involving 6925 people who were overweight or living with obesity. The biggest trial was in 419 people and the smallest was in 20 people. All except one of the trials were conducted in high-income countries worldwide, and nearly half were undertaken in the USA (26). Most trials (36) were undertaken in people who did not have heart disease or risk factors. Most people (5118 people) did not have type 2 diabetes. The average starting weight of people across the trials was 95 kg. Most studies (37) lasted for six months or less; and the longest studies (6) lasted for two years. Main results Low-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets probably result in little to no difference in weight loss over the short term (trials lasting 3 to 8.5 months) and long term (trials lasting one to two years) compared to balanced-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets, in people with and without type 2 diabetes. In the short term, the average difference in weight loss was about 1 kg and in the long term, the average difference was less than 1 kg. People lost weight on both diets in some trials. The amount of weight lost on average varied greatly with both diets across the trials from less than 1 kg in some trials and up to about 12 kg in others in the short term and long term. Similarly, low-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets probably result in little to no difference in diastolic blood pressure, glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and LDL cholesterol (�unhealthy� cholesterol) for up to two years. We could not draw any conclusions about unwanted effects reported by participants because very few trials reported these. What are the limitations of the evidence? We are moderately confident in the evidence. Our confidence was lowered mainly because of concerns about how some the trials were conducted, which included that many trials did not report all their results. Further research may change these results.",1100,"Low-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets, Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), Balanced-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets, Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), Cardiovascular risk, Body weight, Weight loss, Diastolic blood pressure (DBP), Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, Confidence interval (CI).",What was the objective of comparing low-carbohydrate diets to balanced-carbohydrate diets in overweight and obese adults in the study?,What methods did the study use to gather data and assess the risk of bias?,What were the main findings regarding weight loss and cardiovascular risk factors when comparing low-carbohydrate and balanced-carbohydrate diets over the study period?
yikunh2@illinois.edu,static_2,Does taxation of unprocessed sugar or foods with added sugar reduce their consumption and prevent obesity or other adverse health outcomes?,"Global prevalence of overweight and obesity are alarming. For tackling this public health problem, preventive public health and policy actions are urgently needed. Some countries implemented food taxes in the past and some were subsequently abolished. Some countries, such as Norway, Hungary, Denmark, Bermuda, Dominica, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and the Navajo Nation (USA), specifically implemented taxes on unprocessed sugar and sugar-added foods. These taxes on unprocessed sugar and sugar-added foods are fiscal policy interventions, implemented to decrease their consumption and in turn reduce adverse health-related, economic and social effects associated with these food products. To assess the effects of taxation of unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods in the general population on the consumption of unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods, the prevalence and incidence of overweight and obesity, and the prevalence and incidence of other diet-related health outcomes. We searched CENTRAL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, Embase and 15 other databases and trials registers on 12 September 2019. We handsearched the reference list of all records of included studies, searched websites of international organisations and institutions, and contacted review advisory group members to identify planned, ongoing or unpublished studies. We included studies with the following populations: children (0 to 17 years) and adults (18 years or older) from any country and setting. Exclusion applied to studies with specific subgroups, such as people with any disease who were overweight or obese as a side-effect of the disease. The review included studies with taxes on or artificial increases of selling prices for unprocessed sugar or food products that contain added sugar (e.g. sweets, ice cream, confectionery, and bakery products), or both, as intervention, regardless of the taxation level or price increase. In line with Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) criteria, we included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-randomised controlled trials (cRCTs), non-randomised controlled trials (nRCTs), controlled before-after (CBA) studies, and interrupted time series (ITS) studies. We included controlled studies with more than one intervention or control site and ITS studies with a clearly defined intervention time and at least three data points before and three after the intervention. Our primary outcomes were consumption of unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods, energy intake, overweight, and obesity. Our secondary outcomes were substitution and diet, expenditure, demand, and other health outcomes. Two review authors independently screened all eligible records for inclusion, assessed the risk of bias, and performed data extraction.Two review authors independently assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We retrieved a total of 24,454 records. After deduplicating records, 18,767 records remained for title and abstract screening. Of 11 potentially relevant studies, we included one ITS study with 40,210 household-level observations from the Hungarian Household Budget and Living Conditions Survey. The baseline ranged from January 2008 to August 2011, the intervention was implemented on September 2011, and follow-up was until December 2012 (16 months). The intervention was a tax - the so-called 'Hungarian public health product tax' - on sugar-added foods, including selected foods exceeding a specific sugar threshold value. The intervention includes co-interventions: the taxation of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) and of foods high in salt or caffeine. The study provides evidence on the effect of taxing foods exceeding a specific sugar threshold value on the consumption of sugar-added foods. After implementation of the Hungarian public health product tax, the mean consumption of taxed sugar-added foods (measured in units of kg) decreased by 4.0% (standardised mean difference (SMD) ?0.040, 95% confidence interval (CI) ?0.07 to ?0.01; very low-certainty evidence). The study was at low risk of bias in terms of performance bias, detection bias and reporting bias, with the shape of effect pre-specified and the intervention unlikely to have any effect on data collection. The study was at unclear risk of attrition bias and at high risk in terms of other bias and the independence of the intervention. We rated the certainty of the evidence as very low for the primary and secondary outcomes. The Hungarian public health product tax included a tax on sugar-added foods but did not include a tax on unprocessed sugar. We did not find eligible studies reporting on the taxation of unprocessed sugar. No studies reported on the primary outcomes of consumption of unprocessed sugar, energy intake, overweight, and obesity. No studies reported on the secondary outcomes of substitution and diet, demand, and other health outcomes. No studies reported on differential effects across population subgroups. We could not perform meta-analyses or pool study results. There was very limited evidence and the certainty of the evidence was very low. Despite the reported reduction in consumption of taxed sugar-added foods, we are uncertain whether taxing unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods has an effect on reducing their consumption and preventing obesity or other adverse health outcomes. Further robustly conducted studies are required to draw concrete conclusions on the effectiveness of taxing unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods for reducing their consumption and preventing obesity or other adverse health outcomes.","As outlined by the World Health Organization, 'globesity' (the rise in overweight and obesity globally) is a major world challenge. A sugar-rich diet, especially when combined with physical inactivity, may cause overweight and obesity, and other harmful health outcomes. There are direct costs to healthcare services of people being overweight or obese, such as preventing and treating health problems that this causes. There are also costs to society as a whole when people who are ill through being overweight or obese are unable to work. This review may be of interest to government public health agencies, policy decision-makers, food retailers, and food industries. This review and subsequent updates of this review may change policy and affect a government's motivation to create a tax on unprocessed sugar and foods with added sugar. It also may motivate food industries to reformulate their products to contain lower levels of added sugar. We wanted to know if taxation of unprocessed sugar and foods with added sugar (other than sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs)) reduced their consumption, changed people's energy intake, and reduced overweight and obesity. We also wanted to know if taxation changed people's diet and spending, and had an effect on other diet-related health problems. We searched for ongoing or published studies up to October 2019. Of a total of 24,454 records retrieved, we identified one 'interrupted time series' (ITS) study meeting our eligibility criteria to assess the impact of a tax on sugar-added foods (but not unprocessed sugar). The study used data from the Hungarian Household Budget and Living Conditions Survey, with observations from 40,210 households. Evidence from the study included a 'baseline' (the situation before taxation), ranging from January 2008 to August 2011. The Hungarian public health product tax was implemented on September 2011. The duration of the follow-up period (measuring the effects of taxation) was 16 months. The study was funded by the Scottish Institute for Research in Economics (SIRE) Early Career Engagement Grant. The included study provided very limited evidence that taxing foods with added sugar reduced their consumption by 4%. We are very uncertain about this evidence because the study did not use the strongest methods, looked at other kinds of taxation as well as taxing foods with added sugar, and may not have correctly classified food types. We are uncertain whether taxing foods with added sugar has an effect on reducing their consumption. The included study did not investigate the effects of taxing unprocessed sugar. Further research is needed to assess the effectiveness of taxing unprocessed sugar or foods with added sugar for reducing their consumption and preventing obesity or other adverse health outcomes. Studies should take place in countries that have implemented these taxes and should look at cost-effectiveness as well as the health benefits of taxing unprocessed sugar or foods with added sugar as a public health policy for preventing overweight, obesity or other adverse health outcomes. Countries that have implemented these taxes are Bermuda, Dominica, Hungary, India, Norway, the Navajo Nation (USA), and St. Vincent and Grenadines.",1103,"prevalence, obesity, sugar-added foods, fiscal policy interventions, consumption, sugar-sweetened beverages, Hungarian public health product tax, energy intake, standardised mean difference, confidence interval",What specific effects on consumption and health outcomes was the study examining with the taxation of unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods?,Which specific study designs and methods were used to assess the impact of the sugar tax intervention in the included research?,What were the actual findings regarding the impact of the Hungarian public health product tax on the consumption of sugar-added foods?
yikunh2@illinois.edu,static_2,Stem cell treatment for chronic ischaemic heart disease and congestive heart failure,"A promising approach to the treatment of chronic ischaemic heart disease and congestive heart failure is the use of stem cells. The last decade has seen a plethora of randomised controlled trials developed worldwide, which have generated conflicting results.
The critical evaluation of clinical evidence on the safety and efficacy of autologous adult bone marrow-derived stem/progenitor cells as a treatment for chronic ischaemic heart disease and congestive heart failure.
We searched CENTRAL in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, and four ongoing trial databases for relevant trials up to 14 December 2015.
Eligible studies were randomised controlled trials comparing autologous adult stem/progenitor cells with no cells in people with chronic ischaemic heart disease and congestive heart failure. We included co-interventions, such as primary angioplasty, surgery, or administration of stem cell mobilising agents, when administered to treatment and control arms equally.
Two review authors independently screened all references for eligibility, assessed trial quality, and extracted data. We undertook a quantitative evaluation of data using random-effects meta-analyses. We evaluated heterogeneity using the I2statistic and explored substantial heterogeneity (I2greater than 50%) through subgroup analyses. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We created a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADEprofiler (GRADEpro), excluding studies with a high or unclear risk of selection bias. We focused our summary of findings on long-term follow-up of mortality, morbidity outcomes, and left ventricular ejection fraction measured by magnetic resonance imaging.
We included 38 randomised controlled trials involving 1907 participants (1114 cell therapy, 793 controls) in this review update. Twenty-three trials were at high or unclear risk of selection bias. Other sources of potential bias included lack of blinding of participants (12 trials) and full or partial commercial sponsorship (13 trials). Cell therapy reduced the incidence of long-term mortality (≥ 12 months) (risk ratio (RR) 0.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.21 to 0.87; participants = 491; studies = 9; I2= 0%; low-quality evidence). Periprocedural adverse events associated with the mapping or cell/placebo injection procedure were infrequent. Cell therapy was also associated with a long-term reduction in the incidence of non-fatal myocardial infarction (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.97; participants = 345; studies = 5; I2= 0%; low-quality evidence) and incidence of arrhythmias (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.99; participants = 82; studies = 1; low-quality evidence). However, we found no evidence that cell therapy affects the risk of rehospitalisation for heart failure (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.09; participants = 375; studies = 6; I2= 0%; low-quality evidence) or composite incidence of mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and/or rehospitalisation for heart failure (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.08; participants = 141; studies = 3; I2= 0%; low-quality evidence), or long-term left ventricular ejection fraction when measured by magnetic resonance imaging (mean difference -1.60, 95% CI -8.70 to 5.50; participants = 25; studies = 1; low-quality evidence).
This systematic review and meta-analysis found low-quality evidence that treatment with bone marrow-derived stem/progenitor cells reduces mortality and improves left ventricular ejection fraction over short- and long-term follow-up and may reduce the incidence of non-fatal myocardial infarction and improve New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Classification in people with chronic ischaemic heart disease and congestive heart failure. These findings should be interpreted with caution, as event rates were generally low, leading to a lack of precision.","Are adult stem/progenitor cells derived from bone marrow safe and effective as a treatment for chronic ischaemic heart disease and heart failure?
The current treatment for people suffering from heart disease and heart failure is drugs and, when possible, restoration of the blood supply in the heart (revascularisation) either by opening the arteries with a tiny balloon in a procedure called primary angioplasty (or percutaneous coronary intervention) or by heart surgery (or coronary artery bypass graft). Revascularisation has reduced the death rate associated with these conditions. In some people, heart disease and heart failure symptoms persist even after revascularisation. Recently, bone marrow stem/progenitor cells have been investigated as a new treatment for people with heart disease and heart failure, whether or not they also undergo revascularisation.
We searched electronic databases for relevant randomised controlled trials to December 2015.
We included 38 randomised controlled trials involving more than 1900 participants in this review, with 14 trials of chronic ischaemic heart disease, 17 trials of ischaemic heart failure secondary to heart disease, and seven trials of refractory or intractable angina. The mean age of participants ranged from 55 to 70 years, and the proportion of male participants ranged from 51% to 100%.
The quality of the evidence was low, as the number of included studies and participants is not currently high enough to draw robust conclusions. Thirteen studies received commercial funding, of which four were fully commercially sponsored, and 12 studies did not report that participants were blinded to the treatment they received. Further research involving a larger number of participants is required to confirm our results.",1037,"Stem cells, Randomised controlled trials, Autologous adult bone marrow-derived stem/progenitor cells, Chronic ischaemic heart disease, Congestive heart failure, Mortality, Left ventricular ejection fraction, Meta-analyses, GRADE approach, Non-fatal myocardial infarction.",What was the study trying to examine regarding the use of autologous adult bone marrow-derived stem/progenitor cells for chronic ischaemic heart disease and congestive heart failure?,What method(s) were used in the study to assess the efficacy and safety of the stem cell treatment?,What results were found in the study concerning the impact of stem cell therapy on long-term mortality and non-fatal myocardial infarction?
yikunh2@illinois.edu,static_2,Is semaglutide an effective weight-loss treatment for adults living with obesity and does it cause unwanted effects?,"To assess the effects of semaglutide on adults living with obesity. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and two trials registries. The latest search date was 17 December 2024.
Semaglutide results in a clinically relevant weight loss at medium-term follow-up compared to placebo, which is likely to be sustained in the long term, while taking the drug. While semaglutide increases the risk of adverse events leading to withdrawal, it appears to be of limited clinical relevance in absolute terms at medium-term, and clinically relevant at long-term follow-up. The effects of semaglutide on quality of life, MACE, and mortality are likely limited or uncertain. Most studies were funded by the drug's manufacturer, raising important concerns about conflicts of interest. We identified 46 ongoing studies that may strengthen future evidence syntheses. Further independent studies are needed, particularly in underrepresented populations, to better understand the broader effects of semaglutide in the management of obesity.
This Cochrane review was funded by the World Health Organization (WHO).
Original protocol (10.1002/14651858.CD015092) published in September 2022. The modifications to the original protocol were prospectively registered in PROSPERO (CRD420250654193) in February 2025.","Obesity is a long-term condition in which a person has too much body fat. It can increase the risk of health problems like type 2 diabetes, diseases of the heart and blood vessels (cardiovascular disease), and some types of cancer. Obesity levels are increasing worldwide, placing a large burden on healthcare systems. Managing obesity often involves lifestyle changes such as eating a healthier diet and being more physically active. However, many people find these changes difficult to maintain, and doctors may prescribe medication to support weight loss. Semaglutide is a medication that mimics a natural gut hormone. It reduces appetite, helping people to lose weight. It can be given as an injection or swallowed. Some people taking semaglutide experience unwanted effects, such as feeling or being sick, diarrhoea and indigestion. Similar medications include liraglutide and tirzepatide. We wanted to know how well semaglutide works in adults with obesity in the medium term (6 to 24 months) and long term (24 months or more). We examined its effects on weight loss, unwanted effects, health problems associated with obesity, quality of life, and risk of death. We did not look at what happens after people stop taking semaglutide. We searched for studies that compared semaglutide with a placebo (a sham medication), lifestyle changes or another weight-loss medication for people living with obesity. We compared and analysed the results, and assessed our confidence in the evidence. We included 18 studies with 27,949 men and women, aged 41 to 69 years, who took semaglutide for between 6 months and 4 years or longer. The studies mainly took place in upper-middle- or high-income countries, and mostly included White and Asian people. They compared semaglutide with placebo, liraglutide and tirzepatide. The main comparison with placebo has the following findings. In the medium term (16 studies, 10,041 people): semaglutide leads to more weight loss as a percentage of body weight, and to more people losing 5% of their body weight than placebo. People may experience mild-to-moderate unwanted effects with semaglutide, but these unwanted effects probably make little or no difference to people deciding to stop treatment. The effects of semaglutide on serious unwanted effects are unclear. Semaglutide likely makes little or no difference to quality of life and may not significantly reduce major cardiovascular events or deaths. In the long term (2 studies, 17,908 people): weight loss probably continues with semaglutide as a percentage of body weight and in the number of people who lose 5% of their body weight. Semaglutide probably makes little to no difference to serious unwanted effects, and we are unsure about its effects on mild-to-moderate unwanted effects. However, these unwanted effects probably make more people decide to stop treatment. Semaglutide likely makes little or no difference to quality of life, major cardiovascular events or death. We are very confident that people taking semaglutide lose more weight than those taking placebo. However, semaglutide's manufacturer was involved in most of the studies, so our confidence in the results is limited. Study locations and participants were quite similar, so we don't know how semaglutide works for people from different backgrounds and places.",1099,"semaglutide, obesity, weight loss, placebo, adverse events, quality of life, MACE, mortality, conflicts of interest, Cochrane review",What was the primary aim of assessing the effects of semaglutide in this study?,Which databases and registries were searched for this study and when was the latest search conducted?,What were the findings regarding weight loss and adverse events related to semaglutide in this study?
yikunh2@illinois.edu,static_2,Omega-6 fats to prevent and treat heart and circulatory diseases,"Omega-6 fats are essential polyunsaturated fats involved in many normal body functions, but there has long been debate about whether increasing omega-6 intake helps prevent cardiovascular disease. This review assessed whether raising dietary omega-6 fats�mainly linoleic acid (LA) and gamma-linolenic acid (GLA)�reduces the risk of death, heart disease, or stroke, and whether it affects cholesterol levels, body weight, or other risk factors. We included 19 randomised controlled trials involving 6461 adults from a range of populations, followed for one to eight years. Most trials asked participants to replace saturated or monounsaturated fats with omega-6 fats, and seven used supplemental GLA while twelve increased dietary LA. No studies specifically investigated other omega-6 fats such as DGLA or AA. Only three of the included trials were judged to be at low overall risk of bias.

Across trials, increasing omega-6 intake probably makes little or no difference to the risk of dying from any cause (risk ratio 1.00, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.12) or to the overall risk of cardiovascular events such as heart attacks and strokes (risk ratio 0.97, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.15). Evidence for effects on cardiovascular death, coronary heart disease events, major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events, and stroke was very uncertain due to low trial quality and wide confidence intervals. No clear effect of dose or duration was seen, although there was a hint that people who started with the lowest omega-6 intake may have experienced slightly greater protection.

Increasing omega-6 fats may slightly reduce the risk of myocardial infarction (risk ratio 0.88, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.02), suggesting that roughly 53 people may need to increase their omega-6 intake to prevent one heart attack, although this estimate remains uncertain. High-quality evidence showed that increasing omega-6 intake consistently lowers total cholesterol by a small amount (about 0.33 mmol/L on average), and this effect was stronger at higher doses. However, omega-6 intake appears to have little or no meaningful effect on triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, body weight, or body mass index.

Overall, current evidence does not show that increasing omega-6 fats meaningfully reduces major cardiovascular outcomes, other than a possible small reduction in heart attack risk. Omega-6 intake does modestly lower total cholesterol, but it does not appear to improve other blood fats or reduce body weight. While increasing omega-6 fats may still be helpful for people at higher risk of myocardial infarction, stronger and higher-quality evidence is needed to determine whether omega-6 fats provide meaningful long-term cardiovascular benefits.","We reviewed randomised trials (participants had an equal chance to be assigned to either treatment) examining effects of higher omega-6 fats compared to lower omega-6 fats on deaths and heart and circulatory diseases (cardiovascular diseases (CVD), which include heart attacks and strokes).
Omega-6 fats are essential, we must obtain some from food. They are important for regulating energy production (part of metabolism), bone, skin and hair health. Many foods contain omega-6 fats, particularly vegetable oils and nuts. Omega-6 fats include linoleic acid (LA), gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) and arachidonic acid (AA).
Some evidence suggests that a higher intake of omega-6 fats, along with a lower intake of saturated fat (from animal sources such as meat and cheese) can reduce coronary heart disease. In contrast, there is concern that high levels of omega-6 fats may worsen cardiovascular risk by increasing inflammation. Overall, there is no conclusive evidence on the benefits or harms of omega-6 fat intake on heart and circulatory diseases or on other health outcomes.
Evidence in this review is current to May 2017. We found 19 studies recruiting 6461 adults. These studies assessed the effects of higher compared to lower omega-6 fat intake on heart and circulatory diseases as well as deaths. We found that three trials were highly trustworthy (with good designs that produce reliable evidence). Studies took place in North America, Asia, Europe and Australia, and eight were funded only by national or charitable agencies. Participants increased their omega-6 fats or maintained their usual fats for at least one year and up to eight years.",1050,"Omega-6 fats, linoleic acid (LA), gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), cardiovascular disease, myocardial infarction, total cholesterol, randomised controlled trials, risk ratio, coronary heart disease events, confidence intervals",What was the study trying to examine regarding omega-6 fats and cardiovascular disease?,What methods were used in the study to assess the effects of increased omega-6 intake?,What were the study's findings on the effects of omega-6 intake on cardiovascular outcomes and cholesterol levels?
yikunh2@illinois.edu,interactive_3,What are the benefits and risks of inhaled bronchodilators in preterm newborns for preventing and treating lung disease?,"Chronic lung disease (CLD) occurs frequently in preterm infants and is associated with respiratory morbidity. Bronchodilators have the potential effect of dilating small airways with muscle hypertrophy. Increased compliance and tidal volume, and decreased airway resistance, have been documented with the use of bronchodilators in infants with CLD. Therefore, bronchodilators are widely considered to have a role in the prevention and treatment of CLD, but there remains uncertainty as to whether they improve clinical outcomes. This is an update of the 2016 Cochrane review. To determine the effect of inhaled bronchodilators given as prophylaxis or as treatment for chronic lung disease (CLD) on mortality and other complications of preterm birth in infants at risk for or identified as having CLD. An Information Specialist searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and three trials registers from 2016 to May 2023. In addition, the review authors undertook reference checking, citation searching and contact with trial authors to identify additional studies. We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials involving preterm infants less than 32 weeks old that compared bronchodilators to no intervention or placebo. CLD was defined as oxygen dependency at 28 days of life or at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age. Initiation of bronchodilator therapy for the prevention of CLD had to occur within two weeks of birth. Treatment of infants with CLD had to be initiated before discharge from the neonatal unit. The intervention had to include administration of a bronchodilator by nebulisation or metered dose inhaler. The comparator was no intervention or placebo. We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Critical outcomes included: mortality within the trial period; CLD (defined as oxygen dependency at 28 days of life or at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age); adverse effects of bronchodilators, including hypokalaemia (low potassium levels in the blood), tachycardia, cardiac arrhythmia, tremor, hypertension and hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar); and pneumothorax. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. We included two randomised controlled trials in this review update. Only one trial provided useable outcome data. This trial was conducted in six neonatal intensive care units in France and Portugal, and involved 173 participants with a gestational age of less than 31 weeks. The infants in the intervention group received salbutamol for the prevention of CLD. The evidence suggests that salbutamol may result in little to no difference in mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50 to 2.31; risk difference (RD) 0.01, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.11; low-certainty evidence) or CLD at 28 days (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.37; RD 0.02, 95% CI -0.13 to 0.17; low-certainty evidence), when compared to placebo. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of salbutamol on pneumothorax. The one trial with usable data reported that there were no relevant differences between groups, without providing the number of events (very low-certainty evidence). Investigators in this study did not report if side effects occurred. We found no eligible trials that evaluated the use of bronchodilator therapy for the treatment of infants with CLD. We identified no ongoing studies. Low-certainty evidence from one trial showed that inhaled bronchodilator prophylaxis may result in little or no difference in the incidence of mortality or CLD in preterm infants, when compared to placebo. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of salbutamol on pneumothorax, and neither included study reported on the incidence of serious adverse effects. We identified no trials that studied the use of bronchodilator therapy for the treatment of CLD. Additional clinical trials are necessary to assess the role of bronchodilator agents in the prophylaxis or treatment of CLD. Researchers studying the effects of inhaled bronchodilators in preterm infants should include relevant clinical outcomes in addition to pulmonary mechanical outcomes.","Newborns born too early, especially those born before 28 weeks of pregnancy, face a higher risk of death, lung disease, and brain impairment than babies born at or near term, and some develop long-term problems such as intellectual disabilities, blindness, or deafness. Chronic lung disease is common among preterm infants who cannot breathe independently and require oxygen or mechanical ventilation. Bronchodilators are medicines that widen the air passages in the lungs and may help open small airways in preterm babies; they are used to treat or potentially prevent chronic lung disease. These medicines can be inhaled, taken by mouth, injected, or delivered through a nebuliser, but they may cause side effects such as low potassium levels, fast or abnormal heart rhythms, tremor, high blood pressure, high sugar levels, or lung collapse. We wanted to find out whether bronchodilators reduce the risk of death or chronic lung disease and whether they increase the risk of unwanted effects, including abnormal heart rhythms, tremor, high blood pressure, high sugar levels, or pneumothorax (collapsed lung). We searched for studies evaluating bronchodilators in preterm infants and summarised the findings, rating our confidence in the evidence based on study design and sample size. Only two studies met the criteria, and one did not report any relevant outcomes. The remaining study involved 173 preterm newborns at risk of chronic lung disease who were treated with salbutamol or placebo. Salbutamol may make little to no difference to the risk of death or chronic lung disease compared with placebo, and its effect on pneumothorax is unclear; in this study it was given at a dose of 200 micrograms every four hours for 28 days. The study did not report any adverse effects of salbutamol, and there are no ongoing studies investigating bronchodilator use in preterm infants. We are not confident in the evidence because complete results were available from only one study.",1081,"Chronic lung disease, bronchodilators, salbutamol, preterm infants, mortality, oxygen dependency, pulmonary mechanical outcomes, randomised controlled trials, adverse effects, pneumothorax",What was the study trying to determine or examine regarding the use of inhaled bronchodilators for chronic lung disease in preterm infants?,What methods were used in the study to evaluate the effects of bronchodilators on chronic lung disease in preterm infants?,What results were found in the study regarding the impact of bronchodilator therapy on mortality and chronic lung disease in preterm infants?
yikunh2@illinois.edu,interactive_3,"Improving the implementation of healthy eating, physical activity and obesity prevention policies, practices or programmes in childcare services","Despite the existence of effective interventions and best-practice guideline recommendations for childcare services to implement evidence-based policies, practices and programmes to promote child healthy eating, physical activity and prevent unhealthy weight gain, many services fail to do so. The primary aim of the review was to examine the effectiveness of strategies aimed at improving the implementation of policies, practices or programmes by childcare services that promote child healthy eating, physical activity and/or obesity prevention.The secondary aims of the review were to: 1. Examine the cost or cost-effectiveness of such strategies;2. Examine any adverse effects of such strategies on childcare services, service staff or children;3. Examine the effect of such strategies on child diet, physical activity or weight status. 4. Describe the acceptability, adoption, penetration, sustainability and appropriateness of such implementation strategies. We searched the following electronic databases on February 22 2019: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In Process, Embase, PsycINFO, ERIC, CINAHL and SCOPUS for relevant studies. We searched reference lists of included studies, handsearched two international implementation science journals, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (www.who.int/ictrp/) and ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov). We included any study (randomised or nonrandomised) with a parallel control group that compared any strategy to improve the implementation of a healthy eating, physical activity or obesity prevention policy, practice or programme by staff of centre-based childcare services to no intervention, 'usual' practice or an alternative strategy. Centre-based childcare services included preschools, nurseries, long daycare services and kindergartens catering for children prior to compulsory schooling (typically up to the age of five to six years).
Two review authors independently screened study titles and abstracts, extracted study data and assessed risk of bias; we resolved discrepancies via consensus. We performed meta-analysis using a random-effects model where studies with suitable data and homogeneity were identified; otherwise, findings were described narratively. Twenty-one studies, including 16 randomised and five nonrandomised, were included in the review. The studies sought to improve the implementation of policies, practices or programmes targeting healthy eating (six studies), physical activity (three studies) or both healthy eating and physical activity (12 studies). Studies were conducted in the United States (n = 12), Australia (n = 8) and Ireland (n = 1). Collectively, the 21 studies included a total of 1945 childcare services examining a range of implementation strategies including educational materials, educational meetings, audit and feedback, opinion leaders, small incentives or grants, educational outreach visits or academic detailing, reminders and tailored interventions. Most studies (n = 19) examined implementation strategies versus usual practice or minimal support control, and two compared alternative implementation strategies. For implementation outcomes, six studies (one RCT) were judged to be at high risk of bias overall. The review findings suggest that implementation strategies probably improve the implementation of policies, practices or programmes that promote child healthy eating, physical activity and/or obesity prevention in childcare services. Of the 19 studies that compared a strategy to usual practice or minimal support control, 11 studies (nine RCTs) used score-based measures of implementation (e.g. childcare service nutrition environment score). Nine of these studies were included in pooled analysis, which found an improvement in implementation outcomes (SMD 0.49; 95% CI 0.19 to 0.79; participants = 495; moderate-certainty evidence). Ten studies (seven RCTs) used dichotomous measures of implementation (e.g. proportion of childcare services implementing a policy or specific practice), with seven of these included in pooled analysis (OR 1.83; 95% CI 0.81 to 4.11; participants = 391; low-certainty evidence). Findings suggest that such interventions probably lead to little or no difference in child physical activity (four RCTs; moderate-certainty evidence) or weight status (three RCTs; moderate-certainty evidence), and may lead to little or no difference in child diet (two RCTs; low-certainty evidence). None of the studies reported the cost or cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Three studies assessed the adverse effects of the intervention on childcare service staff, children and parents, with all studies suggesting they have little to no difference in adverse effects (e.g. child injury) between groups (three RCTs; low-certainty evidence). Inconsistent quality of the evidence was identified across review outcomes and study designs, ranging from very low to moderate. The primary limitation of the review was the lack of conventional terminology in implementation science, which may have resulted in potentially relevant studies failing to be identified based on the search terms used. Current research suggests that implementation strategies probably improve the implementation of policies, practices or programmes by childcare services, and may have little or no effect on measures of adverse effects. However such strategies appear to have little to no impact on measures of child diet, physical activity or weight status.","This review aimed to look at the effects of strategies to improve the implementation (or correct undertaking) of policies, practices or programmes by childcare services that promote children's healthy eating, physical activity and/or obesity prevention. We wanted to determine the cost or cost-effectiveness of providing implementation support, whether support strategies were associated with any adverse effects, and whether there was an impact on child nutrition, physical activity or weight status. We also looked at the implementation strategy acceptability, adoption, penetration, sustainability and appropriateness. A number of childcare service-based interventions have been found to be effective in improving child diet, increasing child physical activity and preventing excessive weight gain. Despite the existence of such evidence and best-practice guideline recommendations for childcare services to implement these policies, practices or programmes, many childcare services fail to do so. Without proper implementation, children will not benefit from these child health-directed policies, practices or programmes. We identified 21 studies, 19 of which examined implementation strategies versus usual practice or minimal support control, and two that compared different types of implementation strategies. The studies sought to improve the implementation of policies, practices or programmes targeting healthy eating (six studies), physical activity (three studies) or both healthy eating and physical activity (twelve studies). Collectively, the 21 included studies included a total of 1945 childcare services and examined a range of implementation strategies including educational materials, educational meetings, audit and feedback, opinion leaders, small incentives or grants, educational outreach visits or academic detailing, reminders and tailored interventions. The strategies tested were only a small number of those that could be applied to improve implementation in this setting. Findings suggest that implementation support strategies can improve the implementation of physical activity policies, programmes or practices by childcare services or their staff (moderate-certainty evidence), and do not appear to increase the risk of child injury (low-certainty evidence). However, such approaches do not appear to have an impact on the diet, physical activity or weight status of children (low to moderate-certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported information regarding implementation strategy costs or measures of cost-effectiveness. The lack of consistent terminology in this area of research may have meant some relevant studies were not picked up in our search.",1104,"implementation strategies, childcare services, healthy eating, physical activity, obesity prevention, randomised, risk of bias, meta-analysis, pooled analysis, moderate-certainty evidence",What was the primary aim of the review in terms of examining the effectiveness of implementation strategies in childcare services?,What databases were searched and what types of studies were included in the review process for examining these strategies?,"What were the findings in terms of the impact of implementation strategies on child diet, physical activity, and weight status?"
yikunh2@illinois.edu,interactive_3,Ezetimibe for the prevention of heart disease and death,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains an important cause of mortality and morbidity, and high levels of blood cholesterol are thought to be the major modifiable risk factors for CVD. The use of statins is the preferred treatment strategy for the prevention of CVD, but some people at high-risk for CVD are intolerant to statin therapy or unable to achieve their treatment goals with the maximal recommended doses of statin. Ezetimibe is a selective cholesterol absorption inhibitor, whether it has a positive effect on CVD events remains uncertain. Results from clinical studies are inconsistent and a thorough evaluation of its efficacy and safety for the prevention of CVD and mortality is necessary.
To assess the efficacy and safety of ezetimibe for the prevention of CVD and all-cause mortality.
We searched the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and Web of Science on 27 June 2018, and two clinical trial registry platforms on 11 July 2018. We checked reference lists from primary studies and review articles for additional studies. No language restrictions were applied.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared ezetimibe versus placebo or ezetimibe plus other lipid-modifying drugs versus other lipid-modifying drugs alone in adults, with or without CVD, and which had a follow-up of at least 12 months.
Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, assessed risk of bias and contacted trialists to obtain missing data. We performed statistical analyses according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and used the GRADE to assess the quality of evidence.
We included 26 RCTs randomising 23,499 participants. All included studies assessed effects of ezetimibe plus other lipid-modifying drugs compared with other lipid-modifying drugs alone or plus placebo. Our findings were driven by the largest study (IMPROVE-IT), which had weights ranging from 41.5% to 98.4% in the different meta-analyses. Ezetimibe with statins probably reduces the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events compared with statins alone (risk ratio (RR) 0.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90 to 0.98; a decrease from 284/1000 to 267/1000, 95% CI 256 to 278; 21,727 participants; 10 studies; moderate-quality evidence). Trials reporting all-cause mortality used ezetimibe with statin or fenofibrate and found they have little or no effect on this outcome (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.05; 21,222 participants; 8 studies; high-quality evidence). Adding ezetimibe to statins probably reduces the risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.95; a decrease from 105/1000 to 92/1000, 95% CI 85 to 100; 21,145 participants; 6 studies; moderate-quality evidence) and non-fatal stroke (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.97; a decrease 32/1000 to 27/1000, 95% CI 23 to 31; 21,205 participants; 6 studies; moderate-quality evidence). Trials reporting cardiovascular mortality added ezetimibe to statin or fenofibrate, probably having little or no effect on this outcome (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.12; 19457 participants; 6 studies; moderate-quality evidence). The need for coronary revascularisation might be reduced by adding ezetimibe to statin (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.89 to 0.99; a decrease from 196/1000 to 184/1000, 95% 175 to 194; 21,323 participants; 7 studies); however, no difference in coronary revascularisation rate was observed when a sensitivity analysis was limited to studies with a low risk of bias. In terms of safety, adding ezetimibe to statins may make little or no difference in the risk of hepatopathy (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.35; 20,687 participants; 4 studies; low-quality evidence). It is uncertain whether ezetimibe increase or decrease the risk of myopathy (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.72 to 2.38; 20,581 participants; 3 studies; very low-quality evidence) and rhabdomyolysis, given the wide CIs and low event rate. Little or no difference in the risk of cancer, gallbladder-related disease and discontinuation due to adverse events were observed between treatment groups. For serum lipids, adding ezetimibe to statin or fenofibrate might further reduce the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol and triglyceride levels and likely increase the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels; however, substantial heterogeneity was detected in most analyses. None of the included studies reported on health-related quality of life.
Moderate- to high-quality evidence suggests that ezetimibe has modest beneficial effects on the risk of CVD endpoints, primarily driven by a reduction in non-fatal MI and non-fatal stroke, but it has little or no effect on clinical fatal endpoints. The cardiovascular benefit of ezetimibe might involve the reduction of LDL-C, total cholesterol and triglycerides. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether ezetimibe increases the risk of adverse events due to the low and very low quality of the evidence. The evidence for beneficial effects was mainly obtained from individuals with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD, predominantly with acute coronary syndrome) administered ezetimibe plus statins. However, there is limited evidence regarding the role of ezetimibe in primary prevention and the effects of ezetimibe monotherapy in the prevention of CVD, and these topics thus requires further investigation.","Is taking ezetimibe safe and does it prevent heart disease and death? Heart disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, and controlling lipid levels is one of the most effective strategies for preventing heart disease. The use of statins is the preferred treatment strategy for the prevention of heart disease, but some people at high risk of heart disease are intolerant to statins or with a poor response to statin therapy. Ezetimibe is a non-statin drug that can reduce the blood lipids levels by inhibiting cholesterol absorption, but whether it has beneficial effects on heart disease and death remains uncertain. This evidence is current up to July 2018. We included 26 studies involving 23,499 participants. These studies assessed the effects of ezetimibe plus other lipid-lowering drugs versus lipid-lowering drugs alone for heart disease. The participants were adults, and most of them had been diagnosed with coronary heart disease. Ezetimibe with statins probably reduces the risk for combined outcome of death due to heart disease, heart attack or stroke, but the benefit is moderate. However, adding ezetimibe to statin or fenofibrate have little or no effect on death from any cause. Treatment with ezetimibe and statin probably reduces the risk for non-fatal heart attacks and non-fatal stroke. Adding ezetimibe to statin or fenofibrate probably have little or no effect on heart-related death. Ezetimibe with statins might reduce the need for coronary revascularisation (the restoration of an adequate blood supply to the heart) by means of surgery. In terms of safety, we do not have enough evidence to know whether ezetimibe increases or decreases side-effects (e.g. liver injury, muscle pain, cancer, gallbladder-related disease and discontinuation). The analysis of blood lipids revealed that the addition of ezetimibe statin or fenofibrate therapy might further reduce the levels of blood lipids, including low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ('bad' cholesterol), total cholesterol and triglycerides, and likely increased the level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ('good' cholesterol). None of the included studies reported on health-related quality of life. There is a lack of evidence supporting the use of ezetimibe monotherapy for the prevention of heart disease, and this topic requires further investigation. The quality of evidence ranged from high to very low across the outcomes.",1044,"Cardiovascular disease, statins, ezetimibe, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, major adverse cardiovascular events, randomised controlled trials, risk ratio, high-quality evidence",What was the study trying to examine regarding ezetimibe in relation to cardiovascular disease and mortality?,What methods were used in the study to assess the efficacy and safety of ezetimibe for the prevention of cardiovascular disease?,What were the key results of the study in terms of ezetimibe's effect on cardiovascular endpoints and adverse events?
yikunh2@illinois.edu,interactive_4,Can strategies intended to improve how care is organised or delivered to people with overweight or obesity lead to greater weight reduction?,"The prevalence of overweight and obesity is increasing globally, an increase which has major implications for both population health and costs to health services. This is an update of a Cochrane Review.
To assess the effects of strategies to change the behaviour of health professionals or the organisation of care compared to standard care, to promote weight reduction in children and adults with overweight or obesity.
We searched the following databases for primary studies up to September 2016: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, DARE and PsycINFO. We searched the reference lists of included studies and two trial registries.
We considered randomised trials that compared routine provision of care with interventions aimed either at changing the behaviour of healthcare professionals or the organisation of care to promote weight reduction in children and adults with overweight or obesity. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane when conducting this review. We report the results for the professional interventions and the organisational interventions in seven 'Summary of findings' tables. We identified 12 studies for inclusion in this review, seven of which evaluated interventions targeting healthcare professional and five targeting the organisation of care. Eight studies recruited adults with overweight or obesity and four recruited children with obesity. Eight studies had an overall high risk of bias, and four had a low risk of bias. In total, 139 practices provided care to 89,754 people, with a median follow-up of 12 months. Professional interventions Educational interventions aimed at general practitioners (GPs), may slightly reduce the weight of participants (mean difference (MD) -1.24 kg, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.84 to 0.37; 3 studies, N = 1017 adults; low-certainty evidence). Tailoring interventions to improve GPs' compliance with obesity guidelines probably leads to little or no difference in weight loss (MD 0.05 (kg), 95% CI -0.32 to 0.41; 1 study, N = 49,807 adults; moderate-certainty evidence). It is uncertain if providing doctors with reminders results in a greater weight reduction than standard care (men: MD -11.20 kg, 95% CI -20.66 kg to -1.74 kg, and women: MD -1.30 kg, 95% CI [-7.34, 4.74] kg; 1 study, N = 90 adults; very low-certainty evidence). Providing clinicians with a clinical decision support (CDS) tool to assist with obesity management at the point of care leads to little or no difference in the body mass index (BMI) z-score of children (MD -0.08, 95% CI -0.15 to -0.01 in 378 children; moderate-certainty evidence), CDS tools may lead to little or no difference in weight loss in adults: MD -0.095 kg (-0.21 lbs), P = 0.47; 1 study, N = 35,665; low-certainty evidence. Organisational interventions Adults with overweight or obesity may lose more weight if the care was provided by a dietitian (by -5.60 kg, 95% CI -4.83 kg to -6.37 kg) or by a doctor-dietitian team (by -6.70 kg, 95% CI -7.52 kg to -5.88 kg; 1 study, N = 270 adults; low-certainty evidence). Shared care leads to little or no difference in the BMI z-score of children with obesity (adjusted MD -0.05, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.03; 1 study, N = 105 children; low-certainty evidence). Organisational restructuring of the delivery of primary care (i.e. introducing the chronic care model) may result in a slightly lower increase in the BMI of children who received care at intervention clinics (BMI change: adjusted MD -0.21, 95% CI -0.50 to 0.07; 1 study, unadjusted MD -0.18, 95% CI -0.20 to -0.16; N=473 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Mail and phone interventions probably lead to little or no difference in weight loss in adults (mean weight change (kg) using mail: -0.36, 95% CI -1.18 to 0.46; phone: -0.44, 95% CI -1.26 to 0.38; 1 study, N = 1801 adults; moderate-certainty evidence). Care delivered by a nurse at a primary care clinic may lead to little or no difference in the BMI z-score in children (MD -0.02, 95% CI -0.16 to 0.12; 1 study, N = 52 children; very low-certainty evidence). Two studies reported data on cost effectiveness: one study favoured mail and standard care over telephone consultations, and the other study achieved weight loss at a modest cost in both intervention groups (doctor and doctor-dietitian). One study of shared care reported similar adverse effects in both groups. We found little convincing evidence for a clinically-important effect on participants' weight or BMI of any of the evaluated interventions. While pooled results from three studies indicate that educational interventions targeting healthcare professionals may lead to a slight weight reduction in adults, the certainty of these results is low. Two trials evaluating CDS tools (unpooled results) for improved weight management suggest little or no effect on weight or BMI change in adults or children with overweight or obesity. Evidence for all the other interventions evaluated came mostly from single studies. The certainty of the included evidence varied from moderate to very low for the main outcomes (weight and BMI). All of the evaluated interventions would need further investigation to ascertain their strengths and limitations as effective strategies to change the behaviour of healthcare professionals or the organisation of care. As only two studies reported on cost, we know little about cost effectiveness across the evaluated interventions.","To assess the effectiveness of strategies to change the behaviour of health professionals and the organisation of care to promote weight reduction in people with overweight and obesity. This is an update of a Cochrane Review.
The number of people with overweight or obesity is increasing around the world. Excessive weight is associated with many chronic diseases. We searched the literature for studies that evaluated the effects of interventions aimed at changing the behaviour of health professionals or the way care is organised for improved weight management and weight loss. We included 12 studies, eight in adults and four in children. One hundred and thirty-nine family practices were included, providing care to 89,754 people who were followed for 12 months. Seven studies evaluated the effects of various interventions directed at healthcare professionals (i.e. education, reminders, and decision support tools), and the other five evaluated different organisational interventions (i.e. changes in who delivers the health care, how and where it is delivered, etc.). The comparison intervention was standard care, or the opportunity to seek it. The main outcomes assessed were weight or weight change for adults, and how their weight compared with their peers for children. Professional interventions: Brief education of primary care physicians in weight management may slightly decrease the weight of their patients. Tailoring the education to the healthcare professional to improve how closely they follow guidelines probably led to little or no difference in obesity management or weight loss at study end. We are uncertain whether issuing doctors with printed reminders about weight management strategies helped to reduce their patients' weight, compared to standard care.
Two studies reported that providing doctors with a clinical decision support tool within the practice may lead to little or no difference in the BMI of children with obesity or in the weight of adults with overweight or obesity, compared to patients receiving standard care. Organisational interventions: Two studies assessed the effect of multidisciplinary teams. Weight-loss programmes led by a dietitian or by a doctor plus a dietitian may lead to greater weight loss in adult patients than standard care. Shared care (between family practice and hospital doctors and dietitians) probably leads to little or no difference in the BMI of children with obesity, compared to standard care. Organisational restructuring of the delivery of family practice care (i.e. introducing the chronic care model: training of the whole practice team, enhanced electronic medical record system, the paediatric nurse practitioners playing a key role in delivering the intervention) led to a slightly lower increase in the BMI of children with obesity at intervention clinics, compared to standard care.
Two studies assessed changes in the setting of service delivery. The use of both mail and phone interventions to promote weight loss probably led to little or no difference in weight loss of adults with overweight or obesity, compared to standard care. Family practice weight management programmes conducted by nurses may lead to little or no difference in BMI in children with obesity, as compared to specialist obesity hospital clinics run by consultants.",1098,"weight reduction, overweight or obesity, healthcare professionals, body mass index (BMI), organisational interventions, professional interventions, clinical decision support (CDS) tools, confidence interval (CI), educational interventions, Cochrane Review",What was the study trying to examine in terms of strategies related to overweight and obesity?,What methods or procedures were used to conduct this review of the interventions?,What were the key results regarding the effectiveness of the professional and organisational interventions?
yikunh2@illinois.edu,interactive_4,Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors for prevention or delay of type 2 diabetes and associated complications in people at increased risk of type 2 diabetes,"Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (AGI) reduce blood glucose levels and may thus prevent or delay type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its associated complications in people at risk of developing of T2DM.
To assess the effects of AGI in people with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), impaired fasting blood glucose (IFG), moderately elevated glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) or any combination of these.
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and the reference lists of systematic reviews, articles and health technology assessment reports. The date of the last search of all databases was December 2017.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), with a duration of one year or more, comparing AGI with any pharmacological glucose-lowering intervention, behaviour-changing intervention, placebo or no intervention in people with IFG, IGT, moderately elevated HbA1c or combinations of these.
Two review authors read all abstracts and full-text articles or records, assessed quality and extracted outcome data independently. One review author extracted data, which were checked by a second review author. We resolved discrepancies by consensus or involvement of a third review author. For meta-analyses we used a random-effects model with assessment of risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes, using 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for effect estimates. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence by using the GRADE instrument.
For this update of the Cochrane Review (first published 2006, Issue 4) we included 10 RCTs (11,814 participants), eight investigating acarbose and two investigating voglibose, that included people with IGT or people ""at increased risk for diabetes"". The trial duration ranged from one to six years. Most trials compared AGI with placebo (N = 4) or no intervention (N = 4). Acarbose reduced the incidence of T2DM compared to placebo: 670 out of 4014 people (16.7%) in the acarbose groups developed T2DM, compared to 812 out of 3994 people (20.3%) in the placebo groups (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.89; P < 0.0001; 3 trials; 8008 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). One trial including participants with coronary heart disease and IGT contributed 64% of cases for this outcome. Acarbose reduced the risk of T2DM compared to no intervention: 7 out 75 people (9.3%) in the acarbose groups developed T2DM, compared to 18 out of 65 people (27.7%) in the no-intervention groups (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.69; P = 0.004; 2 trials; 140 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Acarbose compared to placebo did not reduce or increase the risk of all-cause mortality (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.18; P = 0.86; 3 trials; 8069 participants; very low-certainty evidence), cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.71 to 1.10; P = 0.26; 3 trials; 8069 participants; very low-certainty evidence), serious adverse events (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.29; P = 0.13; 2 trials; 6625 participants; low-certainty evidence), non-fatal stroke (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.74; P = 0.43; 1 trial; 1368 participants; very low-certainty evidence) or congestive heart failure (RR of 0.87; 95% CI 0.63 to 1.12; P = 0.40; 2 trials; 7890 participants; low-certainty evidence). Acarbose compared to placebo reduced non-fatal myocardial infarction: one out of 742 participants (0.1%) in the acarbose groups had a non-fatal myocardial infarction compared to 15 out of 744 participants (2%) in the placebo groups (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.53; P = 0.007; 2 trials; 1486 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Acarbose treatment showed an increased risk of non-serious adverse events (mainly gastro-intestinal events), compared to placebo: 751 of 775 people (96.9%) in the acarbose groups experienced an event, compared to 723 of 775 people (93.3%) in the placebo groups (RR 1.04; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.06; P = 0.0008; 2 trials; 1550 participants). Acarbose compared to no intervention showed no advantage or disadvantage for any of these outcome measures (very low-certainty evidence). One trial each compared voglibose with placebo (1780 participants) or diet and exercise (870 participants). Voglibose compared to placebo reduced the incidence of T2DM: 50 out of 897 participants (5.6%) developed T2DM, compared to 106 out of 881 participants (12%) in the placebo group (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.64; P < 0.0001; 1 trial; 1778 participants; low-certainty evidence). For all other reported outcome measures there were no clear differences between voglibose and comparator groups. One trial with 90 participants compared acarbose with diet and exercise and another trial with 98 participants reported data on acarbose versus metformin. There were no clear differences for any outcome measure between these two acarbose interventions and the associated comparator groups. None of the trials reported amputation of lower extremity, blindness or severe vision loss, end-stage renal disease, health-related quality of life, time to progression to T2DM, or socioeconomic effects.
AGI may prevent or delay the development of T2DM in people with IGT. There is no firm evidence that AGI have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular mortality or cardiovascular events.","People with moderately elevated glucose levels are often said to be at an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Therefore, these people are frequently recommended to increase exercise and lower calorie intake to prevent type 2 diabetes. Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (acarbose, miglitol, voglibose) are used to lower blood glucose in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is currently not known whether alpha-glucosidase inhibitors should be prescribed for people with moderately raised blood glucose levels. We wanted to find out whether alpha-glucosidase inhibitors could prevent or delay type 2 diabetes mellitus in people with moderately elevated glucose levels. We searched medical literature for randomised controlled trials of at least one year's duration investigating alpha-glucosidase inhibitors in participants with glucose levels higher than considered normal but below the diagnostic criteria for type 2 diabetes mellitus. We found 10 randomised controlled trials representing 11,814 participants: eight investigating acarbose and two investigating voglibose. The trial duration ranged from one to six years. When comparing acarbose with placebo, 670 out of 4014 participants (17%) receiving acarbose developed type 2 diabetes compared to 812 out of 3994 participants (20%) receiving placebo. Most data for this comparison came from a trial including people with heart disease. When comparing acarbose with no intervention, seven out of 75 participants (9%) receiving acarbose developed type 2 diabetes compared to 18 out of 65 participants (28%) receiving no intervention. Acarbose treatment did not reduce or increase the risk of death from any cause, death from heart disease, serious side effects, strokes or heart failure. Compared to placebo, acarbose reduced the risk for heart attacks: one out of 742 participants (0.1%) receiving acarbose had a heart attack compared to 15 out of 744 participants (2%) receiving placebo. Acarbose treatment showed an increased risk of non-serious side effects (mainly gastrointestinal events): 751 of 775 people (97%) receiving acarbose had a non-serious side effect compared to 723 of 775 people (93%) receiving placebo. One trial compared voglibose with placebo and another compared voglibose with diet and exercise. When comparing voglibose with placebo, 50 out of 897 participants (5.6%) receiving voglibose developed type 2 diabetes compared to 106 out of 881 participants (12%) receiving placebo. One trial with 90 participants compared acarbose with diet and exercise and another with 98 participants compared acarbose with metformin; there were no important differences for any outcome. None of the trials reported amputation of lower limbs, blindness or severe vision loss, kidney disease, health-related quality of life, time to progression to type 2 diabetes mellitus, or socioeconomic effects such as absence from work or costs. For most of our outcomes we are uncertain or very uncertain how valid the results are. Reasons for this uncertainty include systematic errors in some trials, the low number of trials for several outcomes, imprecise results, and missing data from one included trial.",1012,"Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, Type 2 diabetes mellitus, Acarbose, Randomised controlled trials, Voglibose, Impaired glucose tolerance, Placebo, Cardiovascular mortality, Glycosylated haemoglobin A1c, Risk ratios",What was the main focus of the study regarding alpha-glucosidase inhibitors?,What methods and databases were employed to gather and analyze the data in the study?,What were the key findings of the study regarding the impact of acarbose compared to placebo on the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus?
yikunh2@illinois.edu,interactive_4,Do education programmes improve outcomes in people with both chronic kidney disease and diabetes?,"Adherence to complex regimens for people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes is often poor. Interventions to enhance adherence require intensive education and behavioural counselling. However, whether the existing evidence is scientifically rigorous and can support recommendations for routine use of educational programmes in people with CKD and diabetes is still unknown. This is an update of a review first published in 2011.
To evaluate the benefits and harms of education programmes for people with CKD and diabetes. We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 19 July 2024 using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs investigating the benefits and harms of educational programmes (information and behavioural instructions and advice given by a healthcare provider, who could be a nurse, pharmacist, educator, health professional, medical practitioner, or healthcare provider, through verbal, written, audio-recording, or computer-aided modalities) for people 18 years and older with CKD and diabetes.
Two authors independently screened the literature, determined study eligibility, assessed quality, and extracted and entered data. We expressed dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and continuous data as mean difference (MD) with 95% CI. Data were pooled using the random-effects model. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Eight studies (13 reports, 840 randomised participants) were included. The overall risk of bias was low for objective outcomes and attrition bias, unclear for selection bias, reporting bias and other biases, and high for subjective outcomes. Education programmes compared to routine care alone probably decrease glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) (4 studies, 467 participants: MD -0.42%, 95% CI -0.53 to -0.31; moderate certainty evidence; 13.5 months follow-up) and may decrease total cholesterol (179 participants: MD -0.35 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.63 to -00.07; low certainty evidence) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (179 participants: MD -0.40 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.65 to -0.14; low certainty evidence) at 18 months of follow-up. One study (83 participants) reported education programmes for people receiving dialysis who have diabetes may improve the diabetes knowledge of diagnosis, monitoring, hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia, medication with insulin, oral medication, personal health habits, diet, exercise, chronic complications, and living with diabetes and coping with stress (all low certainty evidence). There may be an improvement in the general knowledge of diabetes at the end of the intervention and at the end of the three-month follow-up (one study, 97 participants; low certainty evidence) in people with diabetes and moderately increased albuminuria (A2). In participants with diabetes and moderately increased albuminuria (A2) (one study, 97 participants), education programmes may improve a participant’s beliefs in treatment effectiveness and total self-efficacy at the end of five weeks compared to routine care (low certainty evidence). Self-efficacy for in-home blood glucose monitoring and beliefs in personal control may increase at the end of the three-month follow-up (low certainty evidence). There were no differences in other self-efficacy measures. One study (100 participants) reported an education programme may increase change in behaviour for general diet, specific diet and home blood glucose monitoring at the end of treatment (low certainty evidence); however, at the end of three months of follow-up, there may be no difference in any behaviour change outcomes (all low certainty evidence). There were uncertain effects on death, serious hypoglycaemia, and kidney failure due to very low certainty evidence. No data was available for changes in kidney function (creatinine clearance, serum creatinine, doubling of serum creatinine or proteinuria). For an education programme plus multidisciplinary, co-ordinated care compared to routine care, there may be little or no difference in HbA1c, kidney failure, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), systolic or diastolic blood pressure, hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia, and LDL and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (all low certainty evidence in participants with type-2 diabetes mellitus and documented advanced diabetic nephropathy). There were no data for death, patient-orientated measures, change in kidney function (other than eGFR and albuminuria), cardiovascular disease morbidity, quality of life, or adverse events. Education programmes may improve knowledge of some areas related to diabetes care and some self-management practices. Education programmes probably decrease HbA1c in people with CKD and diabetes, but the effect on other clinical outcomes is unclear. This review only included eight studies with small sample sizes. Therefore, more randomised studies are needed to examine the efficacy of education programmes on important clinical outcomes in people with CKD and diabetes.","Chronic kidney disease (a long-term condition where the kidneys do not work effectively) and diabetes (a lifelong condition that causes a person's blood sugar level to become too high) are chronic conditions that bring on many challenges for people, particularly when they have to manage both at the same time. Diabetes can accelerate the development of kidney disease and is the leading cause of kidney failure (a condition where the kidneys no longer function well enough to keep a person alive). While sticking to complex treatment plans can be challenging, successful self-management in the early stages of kidney disease can improve outcomes later in life and delay the need for dialysis or a kidney transplant. Education programmes are any set of planned activities designed to improve a person's ability to manage their condition and delay the progression of their kidney disease. These activities can aim to improve a person's knowledge of their disease, self-care activities, and their ability to self-monitor the disease, thus encouraging and motivating them to create healthy lifestyle changes, improve their treatment compliance, and improve quality of life. We wanted to find out whether an education programme designed for people with both kidney disease and diabetes helps them understand their condition and recognise the importance of strategies aimed at slowing its progression and preventing long-term complications. We searched for randomised studies (studies in which participants are assigned randomly to two or more treatment groups) that compared education programmes to usual care for people with both kidney disease and diabetes. We compared and summarised the results and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and sizes.
We included eight studies involving 840 people 18 years or older with both kidney disease and diabetes. Four studies were undertaken in multiple centres, and four studies were performed in single centres. The duration of follow-up ranged from 12 weeks to four years. Most of the education programmes were designed to increase a person's knowledge of their condition and improve self-management behaviours. One study focused on reducing stress using mindfulness (a person's ability to be aware of where they are and what they are doing), and it was adapted to include practices for complex thoughts and feelings related to diabetes, and one study used a co-ordinated medical care approach with multiple practitioners involved in a person's care. Overall, education programmes probably lower blood glucose levels and may lower total cholesterol and blood pressure, but may make little or no difference to kidney function, abnormally low or high blood sugar, and cardiovascular disease (disorders of the heart and blood vessels). For people with diabetes on dialysis (a procedure to remove waste products and excess fluid from the blood when the kidneys stop working properly), an education programme may improve their knowledge of diabetes, self-management behaviour for checking their feet, using lotion, wearing appropriate shoes and socks, and coping with stress. For people with moderately increased protein in the urine, there may be an improvement in their general knowledge of diabetes, their confidence in monitoring their blood sugar levels at home, their beliefs in their personal control, as well as behavioural changes to their diet. There may be no behavioural changes to exercise, foot care, or quitting smoking.
We have low confidence in education programmes improving the understanding of diabetes in people with kidney disease. This is because the number of studies reporting outcomes of interest was low, and the education programmes varied, so we were unable to properly analyse the results.",1082,"Adherence to complex regimens, randomised controlled trials, educational programmes, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes, LDL cholesterol, Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE), knowledge of diabetes care, self-efficacy",What were the specific benefits and harms of educational programmes for people with CKD and diabetes that the study aimed to evaluate?,What types of trials and data analysis methods were employed to assess the outcomes of the educational programmes in this study?,"What were the effects of the educational programmes on glycated haemoglobin, cholesterol levels, and diabetes knowledge according to the study's findings?"
yikunh2@illinois.edu,finetuned_5,Quality improvement strategies for diabetes care: Effects on outcomes for adults living with diabetes,"There is a large body of evidence evaluating quality improvement (QI) programmes to improve care for adults living with diabetes. These programmes are often comprised of multiple QI strategies, which may be implemented in various combinations. Decision-makers planning to implement or evaluate a new QI programme, or both, need reliable evidence on the relative effectiveness of different QI strategies (individually and in combination) for different patient populations. To update existing systematic reviews of diabetes QI programmes and apply novel meta-analytical techniques to estimate the effectiveness of QI strategies (individually and in combination) on diabetes quality of care. We searched databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL) and trials registers (ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP) to 4 June 2019. We conducted a top-up search to 23 September 2021; we screened these search results and 42 studies meeting our eligibility criteria are available in the awaiting classification section. We included randomised trials that assessed a QI programme to improve care in outpatient settings for people living with diabetes. QI programmes needed to evaluate at least one system- or provider-targeted QI strategy alone or in combination with a patient-targeted strategy. - System-targeted: case management (CM); team changes (TC); electronic patient registry (EPR); facilitated relay of clinical information (FR); continuous quality improvement (CQI). - Provider-targeted: audit and feedback (AF); clinician education (CE); clinician reminders (CR); financial incentives (FI). - Patient-targeted: patient education (PE); promotion of self-management (PSM); patient reminders (PR). Patient-targeted QI strategies needed to occur with a minimum of one provider or system-targeted strategy. We dual-screened search results and abstracted data on study design, study population and QI strategies. We assessed the impact of the programmes on 13 measures of diabetes care, including: glycaemic control (e.g. mean glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c)); cardiovascular risk factor management (e.g. mean systolic blood pressure (SBP), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), proportion of people living with diabetes that quit smoking or receiving cardiovascular medications); and screening/prevention of microvascular complications (e.g. proportion of patients receiving retinopathy or foot screening); and harms (e.g. proportion of patients experiencing adverse hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia). We modelled the association of each QI strategy with outcomes using a series of hierarchical multivariable meta-regression models in a Bayesian framework. The previous version of this review identified that different strategies were more or less effective depending on baseline levels of outcomes. To explore this further, we extended the main additive model for continuous outcomes (HbA1c, SBP and LDL-C) to include an interaction term between each strategy and average baseline risk for each study (baseline thresholds were based on a data-driven approach; we used the median of all baseline values reported in the trials). Based on model diagnostics, the baseline interaction models for HbA1c, SBP and LDL-C performed better than the main model and are therefore presented as the primary analyses for these outcomes. Based on the model results, we qualitatively ordered each QI strategy within three tiers (Top, Middle, Bottom) based on its magnitude of effect relative to the other QI strategies, where 'Top' indicates that the QI strategy was likely one of the most effective strategies for that specific outcome. Secondary analyses explored the sensitivity of results to choices in model specification and priors. Additional information about the methods and results of the review are available as Appendices in an online repository. This review will be maintained as a living systematic review; we will update our syntheses as more data become available. We identified 553 trials (428 patient-randomised and 125 cluster-randomised trials), including a total of 412,161 participants. Of the included studies, 66% involved people living with type 2 diabetes only. Participants were 50% female and the median age of participants was 58.4 years. The mean duration of follow-up was 12.5 months. HbA1c was the commonest reported outcome; screening outcomes and outcomes related to cardiovascular medications, smoking and harms were reported infrequently. The most frequently evaluated QI strategies across all study arms were PE, PSM and CM, while the least frequently evaluated QI strategies included AF, FI and CQI. Our confidence in the evidence is limited due to a lack of information on how studies were conducted. Four QI strategies (CM, TC, PE, PSM) were consistently identified as 'Top' across the majority of outcomes. All QI strategies were ranked as 'Top' for at least one key outcome. The majority of effects of individual QI strategies were modest, but when used in combination could result in meaningful population-level improvements across the majority of outcomes. The median number of QI strategies in multicomponent QI programmes was three. Combinations of the three most effective QI strategies were estimated to lead to the below effects: - PR + PSM + CE: decrease in HbA1c by 0.41% (credibility interval (CrI) -0.61 to -0.22) when baseline HbA1c < 8.3%; - CM + PE + EPR: decrease in HbA1c by 0.62% (CrI -0.84 to -0.39) when baseline HbA1c > 8.3%; - PE + TC + PSM: reduction in SBP by 2.14 mmHg (CrI -3.80 to -0.52) when baseline SBP < 136 mmHg; - CM + TC + PSM: reduction in SBP by 4.39 mmHg (CrI -6.20 to -2.56) when baseline SBP > 136 mmHg; - TC + PE + CM: LDL-C lowering of 5.73 mg/dL (CrI -7.93 to -3.61) when baseline LDL < 107 mg/dL; - TC + CM + CR: LDL-C lowering by 5.52 mg/dL (CrI -9.24 to -1.89) when baseline LDL > 107 mg/dL. Assuming a baseline screening rate of 50%, the three most effective QI strategies were estimated to lead to an absolute improvement of 33% in retinopathy screening (PE + PR + TC) and 38% absolute increase in foot screening (PE + TC + Other). There is a significant body of evidence about QI programmes to improve the management of diabetes. Multicomponent QI programmes for diabetes care (comprised of effective QI strategies) may achieve meaningful population-level improvements across the majority of outcomes. For health system decision-makers, the evidence summarised in this review can be used to identify strategies to include in QI programmes. For researchers, this synthesis identifies higher-priority QI strategies to examine in further research regarding how to optimise their evaluation and effects. We will maintain this as a living systematic review.","Diabetes, a disorder of how sugar is managed by the body, can lead to complications such as heart disease and blindness. If people with diabetes get the best possible treatment, their risk for these and other diabetes-related complications will be lowered. Unfortunately, many people with diabetes do not get the best possible treatment.
Quality improvement programmes using different strategies help healthcare professionals improve care. We examined 12 common types of quality improvement strategies.
- Four strategies were directed at healthcare professionals: audit and feedback, clinician education, clinician reminders and financial incentives.
- Three strategies were directed at people living with diabetes: patient education, patient reminders and promotion of self-management.
- Five strategies involved healthcare organisations: case management, team changes, electronic patient registry, facilitated relay of clinical information and continuous quality improvement.
We wanted to find out which strategies worked best to improve:
- blood sugar control (measured using a test called glycated haemoglobin or HbA1c);
- blood pressure;
- low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C).
Lower levels on these tests are associated with lower rates of complications such as heart attacks.
We also assessed whether quality improvement strategies improved rates of screening for eye damage (also known as retinopathy) and loss of sensation in the foot (also known as neuropathy). Routine screening for these issues in people living with diabetes is recommended to prevent blindness or amputation, respectively.
We searched for randomised trials including adults living with diabetes managed in outpatient settings, which evaluated at least one quality improvement strategy. Although we were interested in strategies directed at people living with diabetes, patient strategies needed to be tested in combination with strategies directed at healthcare organisations or professionals for the study to be included. We summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods, size and other considerations.
We found 553 studies that involved 412,161 people with diabetes up to the year 2019. Studies took place in countries around the world with most being conducted in the USA (231) and in medical settings.
Most studies (367) involved people with type 2 diabetes. Half of the study participants were female. The average age of participants was 57 years. Most studies lasted 12 months.
Studies usually used multiple quality improvement strategies together. Most commonly, studies featured three quality improvement strategies.
Overall, case management, team changes, patient education and promotion of self-management appeared to be the most effective quality improvement strategies for diabetes care.
When considering three-strategy combinations (the median number of quality improvement strategies in multicomponent interventions), the combination of clinician education, promotion of self-management and patient reminders may lead to the most improvement in blood sugar control in people who begin with lower HbA1c. Whereas the combination of case management, patient education and electronic patient registries may lead to the largest improvement in blood sugar control for people who begin with higher HbA1c.
For blood pressure, people who have lower systolic blood pressure may see the most improvement with the combination of patient education, team changes and promotion of self-management. People who have higher systolic blood pressure may improve the most with the combination of case management, team changes and promotion of self-management.
For cholesterol, we found that team changes, patient education and case management may lead to the most improvement in people who already have lower low-density lipoprotein levels. For those who have higher levels of low-density lipoprotein, team changes, case management and clinician reminders may lead to the largest improvement.
Patient education, patient reminders and team changes may lead to an increase in retinopathy screening rates. Patient education, team changes and audit and feedback, financial incentives and continuous quality improvement strategies combined may lead to an increase in foot screening rates.
Clinics can improve their diabetes care by engaging in quality improvement programmes (especially those including case management, team changes, patient education and patient self-management).
Many studies did not provide information on everything we were interested in. Most focused on blood sugar control and few studies reported screening rates. We included studies in this review that had important flaws in the way they were conducted, which limits how confident we can be in our findings.",1097,"quality improvement (QI), diabetes, systematic review, meta-analytical techniques, HbA1c, Bayesian framework, patient-randomised trials, cluster-randomised trials, glycaemic control, cardiovascular risk factor management",What specific aspect of quality improvement programs was the study trying to examine in the context of diabetes care?,What were the main methods used to assess the effectiveness of quality improvement strategies in the study?,What were the primary results found regarding the effectiveness of certain quality improvement strategies in the study?
yikunh2@illinois.edu,finetuned_5,Is favipiravir useful in treating people with COVID-19?,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to challenge the health workforce and societies worldwide. Favipiravir was suggested by some experts to be effective and safe to use in COVID-19. Although this drug has been evaluated in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), it is still unclear if it has a definite role in the treatment of COVID-19. The aim of this Cochrane Review was to assess the effects of favipiravir compared to no treatment, supportive treatment, or other experimental antiviral treatment in people with acute COVID-19. Researchers searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, MEDLINE, Embase, the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease, and three other databases up to 18 July 2023 for RCTs evaluating the efficacy of favipiravir in treating people with COVID-19. Using standard Cochrane methodological procedures and the GRADE approach, they included 25 trials that randomized 5750 adults (most under 60 years of age) across multiple countries, with most participants hospitalized with mild to moderate disease (89%). Twenty-two trials compared favipiravir to placebo or standard of care, two used lopinavir/ritonavir, and one used umifenovir; most regimens began with 1600 mg or 1800 mg twice daily on day one, followed by 600 mg to 800 mg twice daily for five to 14 days. The evidence remains very uncertain regarding whether favipiravir reduces all-cause mortality at 28 to 30 days or in-hospital (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.46; 11 trials, 3459 participants), or whether it reduces progression to invasive mechanical ventilation (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.09; 8 trials, 1383 participants). Favipiravir may make little to no difference in the need for hospital admission among ambulatory patients (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.46; 4 trials, 670 participants), and the evidence is very uncertain regarding time to clinical improvement (HR 1.13, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.83; 4 trials, 721 participants). It may also make little to no difference in progression to oxygen therapy (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.75; 2 trials, 543 participants). Favipiravir may lead to an increased incidence of adverse events overall (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.54; 18 trials, 4699 participants), but may result in little to no difference in serious adverse events attributable to the drug (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.42; 12 trials, 3317 participants). Overall, low- to very low-certainty evidence means that it is not known whether favipiravir is efficacious in people with COVID-19 illness of any severity or admission status, and while treatment may increase general adverse events, it may not increase serious adverse events.","What is favipiravir? Favipiravir is a medicine that can fight viruses. It is usually taken by mouth. Originally used for treating other viral infections, favipiravir has been suggested as a potential treatment for COVID-19 as it prevents the reproduction of the virus. Medical regulators have approved favipiravir for emergency use to treat people with COVID-19. What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out if favipiravir was better than no treatment, supportive treatment, or any other experimental antiviral treatment for people with COVID-19, in terms of death, need for a breathing machine (mechanical ventilation), and other outcomes. We also wanted to find out if favipiravir was associated with any unwanted effects. What did we do? We searched for studies that compared favipiravir with no treatment, supportive treatment, or other antiviral treatment in people with COVID-19 disease. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. What did we find? We found 25 relevant studies involving 5750 people. The studies were conducted in 13 different countries: Bahrain, Brazil, China, India, Iran, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, the UK, and the USA. Most people were under 60 years old and had mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms. What are the main results of our review? � We do not know if favipiravir reduces the number of people who die from COVID-19 when compared to dummy treatment, standard of care, or other antiviral medicines. The evidence supporting this is not very strong (derived from 11 studies involving 3459 people). � It is also very unclear if favipiravir reduces the need for people to be put on ventilators compared to a dummy treatment or any other antiviral treatments (derived from 8 studies involving 1383 people). � In people with mild symptoms, using favipiravir may not reduce the likelihood of needing hospitalization, but more research is needed to be sure (derived from 4 studies involving 670 people). � Favipiravir has an unclear effect on the time it takes for people to improve, as defined by a reduction in their illness severity (derived from 4 studies involving 721 people). � Favipiravir seems to make very little difference in reducing the need for treatment with oxygen, compared to a dummy treatment or other antiviral treatment (derived from 2 studies involving 543 people). � Favipiravir might lead to mild side effects (derived from 18 studies involving 4699 people) but doesn't seem to cause major or severe side effects (derived from 12 studies involving 3317 people). What are the limitations of the evidence? Our confidence in the evidence for using favipiravir is limited because people in the studies had different disease severities and the studies were of varying sizes and had inconsistent results.",1107,"COVID-19, favipiravir, RCTs, all-cause mortality, invasive mechanical ventilation, progression to oxygen therapy, standard of care, adverse events, serious adverse events, GRADE approach",What was the study trying to examine in relation to the use of favipiravir for COVID-19 treatment?,What methods were used in the study to evaluate the efficacy of favipiravir?,What results were found regarding the effectiveness and safety of favipiravir in the treatment of COVID-19?
yikunh2@illinois.edu,finetuned_5,eHealth interventions for people with chronic kidney disease,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with high morbidity and death, which increases as CKD progresses to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). There has been increasing interest in developing innovative, effective and cost-efficient methods to engage with patient populations and improve health behaviours and outcomes. Worldwide there has been a tremendous increase in the use of technologies, with increasing interest in using eHealth interventions to improve patient access to relevant health information, enhance the quality of healthcare and encourage the adoption of healthy behaviours. This review aims to evaluate the benefits and harms of using eHealth interventions to change health behaviours in people with CKD. We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 14 January 2019 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs using an eHealth intervention to promote behaviour change in people with CKD were included. There were no restrictions on outcomes, language or publication type. Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. We included 43 studies with 6617 participants that evaluated the impact of an eHealth intervention in people with CKD. Included studies were heterogeneous in terms of eHealth modalities employed, type of intervention, CKD population studied and outcomes assessed. The majority of studies (39 studies) were conducted in an adult population, with 16 studies (37%) conducted in those on dialysis, 11 studies (26%) in the pre-dialysis population, 15 studies (35%) in transplant recipients and 1 studies (2%) in transplant candidates We identified six different eHealth modalities including: Telehealth; mobile or tablet application; text or email messages; electronic monitors; internet/websites; and video or DVD. Three studies used a combination of eHealth interventions. Interventions were categorised into six types: educational; reminder systems; self-monitoring; behavioural counselling; clinical decision-aid; and mixed intervention types. We identified 98 outcomes, which were categorised into nine domains: blood pressure (9 studies); biochemical parameters (6 studies); clinical end-points (16 studies); dietary intake (3 studies); quality of life (9 studies); medication adherence (10 studies); behaviour (7 studies); physical activity (1 study); and cost-effectiveness (7 studies). Only three outcomes could be meta-analysed as there was substantial heterogeneity with respect to study population and eHealth modalities utilised. There was found to be a reduction in interdialytic weight gain of 0.13kg (4 studies, 335 participants: MD -0.13, 95% CI -0.28 to 0.01; I2= 0%) and a reduction in dietary sodium intake of 197 mg/day (2 studies, 181 participants: MD -197, 95% CI -540.7 to 146.8; I2= 0%). Both dietary sodium and fluid management outcomes were graded as being of low evidence due to high or unclear risk of bias and indirectness (interdialytic weight gain) and high or unclear risk of bias and imprecision (dietary sodium intake). Three studies reported death (2799 participants, 146 events), with 45 deaths/1000 cases compared to standard care of 61 deaths/1000 cases (RR 0.74, CI 0.53 to 1.03; P = 0.08). We are uncertain whether using eHealth interventions, in addition to usual care, impact on the number of deaths as the certainty of this evidence was graded as low due to high or unclear risk of bias, indirectness and imprecision. eHealth interventions may improve the management of dietary sodium intake and fluid management. However, overall these data suggest that current evidence for the use of eHealth interventions in the CKD population is of low quality, with uncertain effects due to methodological limitations and heterogeneity of eHealth modalities and intervention types. Our review has highlighted the need for robust, high quality research that reports a core (minimum) data set to enable meaningful evaluation of the literature.","Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a condition in which kidney function declines over time, and people with CKD must follow complex dietary, lifestyle, and medication recommendations while often relying on multiple specialist healthcare services. Those with advanced CKD may require dialysis or a kidney transplant. Helping patients manage their condition themselves can improve quality and length of life and reduce healthcare costs. Electronic health (eHealth) interventions�defined as health services and information delivered or enhanced through the Internet and related technologies�may support self-management and improve healthcare delivery, but there is limited research on their impact in CKD. We reviewed randomized controlled trials that enrolled people with CKD (including pre-dialysis, dialysis, or kidney transplant recipients) and compared eHealth interventions to usual care. We identified 43 studies involving 6617 participants. eHealth interventions used various technologies such as telehealth, electronic monitors, mobile or tablet apps, text messages or emails, websites, and videos. Interventions were categorized by purpose: education, reminders, self-monitoring, behavioural counselling, clinical decision-aids, and mixed approaches. Outcomes were grouped into nine domains, including diet, quality of life, blood pressure, medication adherence, laboratory results, cost, behaviour, physical activity, and clinical endpoints such as mortality. Overall, it was uncertain whether eHealth interventions improved clinical or patient-centred outcomes compared with usual care. Study quality was low, so it remains unclear whether future high-quality trials would show different results. We therefore remain uncertain about the effectiveness of eHealth interventions for people with CKD and need larger, well-designed studies to understand their true impact.",1083,"Chronic kidney disease, eHealth interventions, end-stage kidney disease, randomised controlled trials, dietary sodium intake, interdialytic weight gain, fluid management, biochemical parameters, medication adherence, quality of life",What was the main objective of evaluating eHealth interventions in the CKD population?,What were the methods used for assessing the eligibility and bias of included studies?,What specific impact did eHealth interventions have on interdialytic weight gain and dietary sodium intake according to the study findings?
yikunh2@illinois.edu,finetuned_6,Does treating the coronary arteries of the heart help prevent heart attacks during major blood vessels surgeries?,"Postoperative myocardial infarction (POMI) is associated with major surgeries and remains the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in people undergoing vascular surgery, with an incidence rate ranging from 5% to 20%. Preoperative coronary interventions, such as coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI), may help prevent acute myocardial infarction in the perioperative period of major vascular surgery when used in addition to routine perioperative drugs (e.g. statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and antiplatelet agents), CABG by creating new blood circulation routes that bypass the blockages in the coronary vessels, and PCI by opening up blocked blood vessels. There is currently uncertainty around the benefits and harms of preoperative coronary interventions.
To assess the effects of preoperative coronary interventions for preventing acute myocardial infarction in the perioperative period of major open vascular or endovascular surgery.
We searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, LILACS, and CINAHL EBSCO on 13 March 2023. We also searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov.
We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs that compared the use of preoperative coronary interventions plus usual care versus usual care for preventing acute myocardial infarction during major open vascular or endovascular surgery. We included participants of any sex or any age undergoing major open vascular surgery, major endovascular surgery, or hybrid vascular surgery.
We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes of interest were acute myocardial infarction, all-cause mortality, and adverse events resulting from preoperative coronary interventions. Our secondary outcomes were cardiovascular mortality, quality of life, vessel or graft secondary patency, and length of hospital stay. We reported perioperative and long-term outcomes (more than 30 days after intervention). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.
We included three RCTs (1144 participants). Participants were randomised to receive either preoperative coronary revascularisation with PCI or CABG plus usual care or only usual care before major vascular surgery. One trial enrolled participants if they had no apparent evidence of coronary artery disease. Another trial selected participants classified as high risk for coronary disease through preoperative clinical and laboratorial testing. We excluded one trial from the meta-analysis because participants from both the control and the intervention groups were eligible to undergo preoperative coronary revascularisation. We identified a high risk of performance bias in all included trials, with one trial displaying a high risk of other bias. However, the risk of bias was either low or unclear in other domains. We observed no difference between groups for perioperative acute myocardial infarction, but the evidence is very uncertain (risk ratio (RR) 0.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 4.57; 2 trials, 888 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). One trial showed a reduction in incidence of long-term (> 30 days) acute myocardial infarction in participants allocated to the preoperative coronary interventions plus usual care group, but the evidence was very uncertain (RR 0.09, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.28; 1 trial, 426 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). There was little to no effect on all-cause mortality in the perioperative period when comparing the preoperative coronary intervention plus usual care group to usual care alone, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.31 to 2.04; 2 trials, 888 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of preoperative coronary interventions on long-term (follow up: 2.7 to 6.2 years) all-cause mortality (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.80; 2 trials, 888 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). One study reported no adverse effects related to coronary angiography, whereas the other two studies reported five deaths due to revascularisations. There may be no effect on cardiovascular mortality when comparing preoperative coronary revascularisation plus usual care to usual care in the short term (RR 0.07, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.32; 1 trial, 426 participants; low-certainty evidence). Preoperative coronary interventions plus usual care in the short term may reduce length of hospital stay slightly when compared to usual care alone (mean difference −1.17 days, 95% CI −2.05 to −0.28; 1 trial, 462 participants; low‐certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence due to concerns about risk of bias, imprecision, and inconsistency. None of the included trials reported on quality of life or vessel graft patency at either time point, and no study reported on adverse effects, cardiovascular mortality, or length of hospital stay at long-term follow-up.
Preoperative coronary interventions plus usual care may have little or no effect on preventing perioperative acute myocardial infarction and reducing perioperative all-cause mortality compared to usual care, but the evidence is very uncertain. Similarly, limited, very low-certainty evidence shows that preoperative coronary interventions may have little or no effect on reducing long-term all-cause mortality. There is very low-certainty evidence that preoperative coronary interventions plus usual care may prevent long-term myocardial infarction, and low-certainty evidence that they may reduce length of hospital stay slightly, but not cardiovascular mortality in the short term, when compared to usual care alone. Adverse effects of preoperative coronary interventions were poorly reported in trials. Quality of life and vessel or graft patency were not reported. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence most frequently for high risk of bias, inconsistency, or imprecision. None of the analysed trials provided significant data on subgroups of patients who could potentially experience more substantial benefits from preoperative coronary intervention (e.g. altered ventricular ejection fraction). There is a need for evidence from larger and homogeneous RCTs to provide adequate statistical power to assess the role of preoperative coronary interventions for preventing acute myocardial infarction in the perioperative period of major open vascular or endovascular surgery.","Heart attacks are an important complication after surgery (postoperative myocardial infarction). This complication plays a large role in major vascular surgeries. Postoperative myocardial infarction is the leading cause of morbidity (illness) and mortality (death) after major vascular surgeries. Coronary artery disease is a condition that affects the blood vessels of the heart (coronary arteries) and occurs when these vessels are narrowed by a plaque (atherosclerosis), usually made of cholesterol. This disease is the main cause of myocardial infarction (when the narrowing progresses to a blockage of the vessel). Atherosclerosis could explain the association between postoperative myocardial infarction and major vascular surgery, as it is the most common cause of both diseases.
We wanted to find out whether treating the coronary arteries prior to major vascular surgery (preoperative coronary interventions) can prevent postoperative myocardial infarction. Treatments to the coronary arteries consist of placing a catheter (thin tube) into an artery, usually in the leg or arm (percutaneous coronary intervention) and inserting it until it reaches the heart where a dye is injected to see if there is a narrowing of the coronary arteries (coronary angiography). Then, if a narrowing is identified, stents are used to open the blood vessels again bringing back the blood flow (coronary revascularisation). Another option for coronary revascularisation is coronary artery bypass graft (a surgical procedure used to bypass blockages in the coronary arteries). We wanted to know if identifying and treating people with severe coronary artery disease before vascular surgery decreases the number of heart attacks after vascular surgery.
We searched for trials that compared one group that received coronary treatments before major vascular surgery plus standard preoperative care (medical management or usual care) versus another group that received standard preoperative care (medical management or usual care) without coronary interventions. We wanted to know if there was a difference between groups in rates of heart attacks, mortality, or adverse outcomes. We compared these outcomes among trials and summarised our findings and then looked at whether the evidence was less or more reliable.
We found three trials involving 1144 participants. The trials compared either coronary angiography or coronary revascularisation, or both, before vascular surgery plus usual care to usual care alone (e.g. statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and antiplatelet agents). The studies used different criteria to select their participants, for example including only those at high risk for coronary artery disease, or also including individuals at low risk. We were not able to combine data from one trial in our summary because a large number of participants in the usual care group also underwent coronary treatments.
We found that treating the coronary arteries before vascular surgery may decrease the long-term rate of heart attacks, but we are very uncertain about the results. Further, they may reduce length of hospital stay slightly in the short term compared to usual care alone. We did not find any difference between groups in short- and long-term mortality and in short-term heart attack rate. None of the trials reported all the outcomes that we were interested in. Adverse events were poorly reported in trials: one study reported no deaths due to coronary angiography, whereas the other two studies reported five deaths due to coronary revascularisation.
We have little confidence in the results because participants and researchers were aware of which groups participants had been assigned to, which could have influenced the results. In addition, trials used different criteria to select their participants and used different methods, making it difficult to compare results. Finally, the overall results included the likelihood of having both benefit or harm from treatment to the coronary arteries before vascular surgery. None of the analysed trials provided information on subgroups of patients who could potentially experience greater benefits from the treatments under study, such as those with altered ventricular ejection fraction (ability of the heart to pump blood).",1038,"Postoperative myocardial infarction, preoperative coronary interventions, coronary artery bypass grafting, percutaneous coronary interventions, myocardial infarction, usual care, major open vascular surgery, all-cause mortality, perioperative period, risk of bias",What was the primary aim of the study regarding preoperative coronary interventions?,What specific methods were used in the study to collect and analyze the data?,What were the main findings concerning the effects of preoperative coronary interventions on perioperative acute myocardial infarction and mortality?
yikunh2@illinois.edu,finetuned_6,Do dietary and activity strategies help prevent obesity in children aged 2 to 4 years?,"To assess the effects of interventions that aimed to prevent obesity in children aged two to four years by changing dietary intake or activity levels, or both, on body mass index (BMI), BMI z-score (zBMI), BMI percentile, and serious adverse events. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, six other databases, and two trial registers, together with reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors to identify eligible studies. The latest search date was 7 February 2023. In early childhood, combined dietary/activity interventions may have very modest benefits on BMI and zBMI at long-term follow-up. When implemented alone, dietary or activity interventions may have little to no effect on BMI measures. Only six studies reported serious adverse events, with no serious harms resulting directly from the intervention, but the evidence is very uncertain.","There is an increasing number of young children living with overweight and obesity worldwide, with evidence of the rates increasing in line with social inequality. Living with overweight during childhood can cause physical and psychological health problems. Children living with overweight are more likely to live with overweight as adults, and continue to experience poor physical and mental health. We wanted to find out if strategies to help people change diet or activity (or both) are effective at preventing obesity in children aged 2 to 4 years, and whether they are associated with any serious adverse events. To examine obesity, we used the measure of body mass index (BMI). BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by their height (in m2). We searched for studies that looked at ways to prevent obesity in children aged 2 to 4 years. We did not include studies that only targeted children who were already living with overweight or obesity, but we did include studies involving children at a range of weights. We only included studies if they used methods aimed at changing children's diet, activity level (increasing physical activity or reducing sedentary behaviour), or both. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We grouped studies together for analysis depending on whether they aimed to improve diet, activity, or both. We found 67 studies involving 36,601 children aged 2 to 4 years. Most studies (63 of 67) were based in high-income countries, and four in upper-middle-income countries. In 26 studies, the strategies were conducted in childcare settings, 23 studies were primarily home-based, and 10 were performed in both childcare and home-based settings. Only 3 studies were conducted in the community, and 5 in healthcare settings. The duration of the programmes varied: 47 ran for fewer than 9 months, with the shortest being 1 visit and the longest lasting 3 years. We analysed results from 56 studies involving 21,404 children. Children who were helped with a strategy to change their diet and activity levels may have had a reduced BMI, compared with children not given any strategy. This means that these children may have been able to minimise excess weight gain by a small amount, which, for public health, is important. Children who were helped with a strategy to change their diet or activity alone did not have a reduced BMI. Only six of the 67 included studies reported on serious adverse events, and no serious harms were identified. Overall, our confidence in the evidence is very low. However, we do not believe that results from more studies similar in design to those included in this review would produce a higher level of confidence in the results. Four main factors reduced our confidence in the evidence. Results were very inconsistent across different studies. There were not enough studies reporting specific types of outcomes for a particular duration of follow-up to be certain about the results for some comparisons. Results from some studies were not reported in a way that we could include in our analyses and this may have had an impact on the combined results. Studies generally had limitations in how they were conducted, due to the complexity of studies in this age group. This review does not provide enough information to assess how well these strategies work for children with disabilities or those from low- and middle-income countries.",1102,"interventions, obesity, dietary intake, activity levels, body mass index, BMI z-score, BMI percentile, serious adverse events, dietary/activity interventions, adverse events",What effects were the study trying to examine in relation to interventions aimed at preventing obesity in young children?,What methods were used to identify eligible studies for the effects of dietary and activity interventions on BMI in children?,What were the results of the study regarding the impact of combined dietary and activity interventions on BMI and zBMI at long-term follow-up?
yikunh2@illinois.edu,finetuned_6,Best therapy for people with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who have not been treated without a targetable mutation and moderately impaired performance status,"Most people who are newly diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have advanced disease. For these people, survival is determined by various patient- and tumor-related factors, of which the performance status (PS) is the most important prognostic factor. People with PS 0 or 1 are usually treated with systemic therapies, whereas people with PS 3 or 4 most often receive supportive care. However, treatment for people with PS 2 without a targetable mutation remains unclear. Historically, people with a PS 2 cancer are frequently excluded from (important) clinical trials because of poorer outcomes and increased toxicity. We aim to address this knowledge gap, as this group of people represents a significant proportion (20% to 30%) of the total population with newly diagnosed lung cancer.
To identify the best first-line therapy for advanced lung cancer in people with performance status 2 without a targetable mutation or with an unknown mutation status.
We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 17 June 2022.
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared different chemotherapy (with or without angiogenesis inhibitor) or immunotherapy regimens, specifically designed for people with PS 2 only or studies including a subgroup of these people.
We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. overall survival (OS), 2. health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and 3. toxicity/adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were 4. tumor response rate, 5. progression-free survival, and 6. survival rates at six and 12 months' treatment. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence for each outcome.
We included 22 trials in this review and identified one ongoing trial. Twenty studies compared chemotherapy with different regimens, of which 11 compared non-platinum therapy (monotherapy or doublet) versus platinum doublet. We found no studies comparing best supportive care with chemotherapy and only two abstracts analyzing chemotherapy versus immunotherapy. We found that platinum doublet therapy showed superior OS compared to non-platinum therapy (hazard ratio [HR] 0.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.57 to 0.78; 7 trials, 697 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There were no differences in six-month survival rates (risk ratio [RR] 1.00, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.41; 6 trials, 632 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), whereas 12-month survival rates were improved for treatment with platinum doublet therapy (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.87 to 0.97; 11 trials, 1567 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). PFS and tumor response rate were also better for people treated with platinum doublet therapy, with moderate-certainty evidence (PFS: HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.77; 5 trials, 487 participants; tumor response rate: RR 2.25, 95% CI 1.67 to 3.05; 9 trials, 964 participants). When analyzing toxicity rates, we found that platinum doublet therapy increased grade 3 to 5 hematologic toxicities, all with low-certainty evidence (anemia: RR 1.98, 95% CI 1.00 to 3.92; neutropenia: RR 2.75, 95% CI 1.30 to 5.82; thrombocytopenia: RR 3.96, 95% CI 1.73 to 9.06; all 8 trials, 935 participants). Only four trials reported HRQoL data; however, the methodology was different per trial and we were unable to perform a meta-analysis. Although evidence is limited, there were no differences in 12-month survival rates or tumor response rates between carboplatin and cisplatin regimens. With an indirect comparison, carboplatin seemed to have better 12-month survival rates than cisplatin compared to non-platinum therapy. The assessment of the efficacy of immunotherapy in people with PS 2 was limited. There might be a place for single-agent immunotherapy, but the data provided by the included studies did not encourage the use of double-agent immunotherapy.
This review showed that as a first-line treatment for people with PS 2 with advanced NSCLC, platinum doublet therapy seems to be preferred over non-platinum therapy, with a higher response rate, PFS, and OS. Although the risk for grade 3 to 5 hematologic toxicity is higher, these events are often relatively mild and easy to treat. Since trials using checkpoint inhibitors in people with PS 2 are scarce, we identified an important knowledge gap regarding their role in people with advanced NSCLC and PS 2.","Lung cancer is the most frequent cause of cancer-related death worldwide and NSCLC is the most common subtype. At the time of diagnosis, the disease has already spread in more than half of all cases. In the tumors of a minority of people diagnosed with NSCLC that has spread to other parts of the body specific mutations can be found, which are treated distinct from the majority of people without such mutations.
NSCLC can only be treated with life-prolonging medicines such as chemotherapy (a medicine used to destroy cancer cells) or immunotherapy (a medicine that boosts the person's immune system and helps the body find and destroy cancer cells). Selecting the best treatment depends on the health condition of the person. That condition is determined using a scale from 0 (no symptoms) to 5 (dead). There is no discussion on the treatment of relatively fit people (scoring 0 or 1), as they often tolerate these treatments relatively well. People with a low health condition (scoring 3 or 4) receive only supportive care in most cases. However, although representing 20% to 30% of all people, the best treatment for moderately impaired people (PS 2) is not clear, as they often do not participate in trials.
Our objective was to investigate the best therapy for people with advanced NSCLC without a specific mutation with PS 2.
We searched medical databases for clinical trials comparing treatments for advanced NSCLC with best supportive care or other treatments.
We found 22 trials; 20 compared different types of chemotherapy and two compared chemotherapy versus immunotherapy.
People treated with chemotherapy regimens using two medicines, including a platinum-based medicine, had longer survival than people treated with chemotherapies without a platinum-based medicine. However, these people did have more side effects, especially with a negative influence on the bone marrow (matter found in the center of bones), resulting in a temporary lack of red and white blood cells, and platelets. The few studies that analyzed health-related quality of life all used different methods of measurement. We found no difference in quality of life when we looked at those studies individually. We found two partly published trials studying immunotherapy, which found no survival benefit compared to chemotherapy.
We are moderately confident in our results that chemotherapies with a platinum-based medicine increases survival. We are also moderately confident in the evidence evaluating the time to progression of disease because in all included studies, both investigators and trial participants were fully aware of which treatment the participants received. This might lead to substantial bias. In addition, we have little confidence in the evidence regarding toxicities because the evidence is based on a small number of studies with conflicting outcomes.

langcao2@illinois.edu,static_1,"For cancer patients, what are the benefits and risks of taking the hormone melatonin?","The objective was to evaluate the benefits and harms of melatonin for preserving health-related quality of life and sleep in cancer patients. To identify relevant studies, researchers used CENTRAL, MEDLINE, 10 additional databases, and four trial registers, along with reference checking, citation searching, and contacting study authors, with the last search conducted on 10 September 2024. The available evidence is of very low certainty, so it is not possible to draw clear conclusions about the effects of melatonin on quality of life and sleep at three months in people receiving cancer treatment. There may be no difference in adverse events between melatonin plus standard treatment and placebo plus standard treatment, but the evidence is very uncertain, and data were lacking for some outcomes such as dizziness. Melatonin used alongside standard treatment probably reduces the risk of fatigue and may reduce nausea when compared to standard treatment alone. However, because the evidence base for melatonin in people with cancer is limited, with insufficient data and risks of bias in study design, it remains difficult to make an informed decision for or against using melatonin as an adjunct to cancer treatment at this time.","Melatonin is a hormone produced in the body to regulate the daily sleep and wakefulness cycle. It has been suggested that melatonin may improve sleep quality and quality of life, which are very important in cancer treatment. Research also suggests that melatonin may be effective against solid tumours and could potentially play a role in cancer treatment. We wanted to find out if melatonin can be used in cancer treatment, particularly for preserving the quality of life and sleep quality of cancer patients, and whether melatonin causes any unwanted side effects. We searched for studies that looked at melatonin used with other standard cancer treatments compared with standard cancer treatments used alone or with placebo. We found 30 studies involving 5093 cancer patients with various types of cancer, conducted in 10 countries. We focused on the effects of melatonin over a period of three months. When compared to placebo plus standard cancer treatments, it is unclear if melatonin has an effect on quality of life and sleep. Melatonin may have little to no effect on potential adverse events such as headache, fatigue, and nausea, but the evidence is very uncertain. No results were available for dizziness. We found no studies assessing quality of life and sleep quality when melatonin is used with standard cancer treatments alone; however, the available studies did evaluate adverse events and found that melatonin probably reduces fatigue and may reduce nausea. It is unclear if melatonin affects headaches, and no results are available for dizziness. When melatonin is used topically, such as in a cream or mouthwash, it is unclear if it has an effect on quality of life, and no studies assessed sleep quality. Adverse events like headache, fatigue, nausea, and dizziness were not relevant for topical use, and no evidence was available for other unwanted effects. We are not confident in the evidence overall because participants in the included studies may have known which treatment they received, the evidence does not cover all cancer types, and some findings are based on small numbers of cases.",1017,"melatonin, cancer patients, health-related quality of life, sleep, adverse events, standard treatment, placebo, fatigue, nausea, risks of bias",What was the study trying to examine regarding melatonin in cancer patients?,What methods did researchers use to identify relevant studies on melatonin?,What were the results regarding the effects of melatonin on fatigue and nausea in the study?
langcao2@illinois.edu,static_1,Dietary intake in people living beyond cancer,"International dietary recommendations include guidance on healthy eating and weight management for people who have survived cancer; however dietary interventions are not provided routinely for people living beyond cancer.
To assess the effects of dietary interventions for adult cancer survivors on morbidity and mortality, changes in dietary behaviour, body composition, health-related quality of life, and clinical measurements.
We ran searches on 18 September 2019 and searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials (CENTRAL), in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE via Ovid; Embase via Ovid; the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED); the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL); and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE). We searched other resources including reference lists of retrieved articles, other reviews on the topic, the International Trials Registry for ongoing trials, metaRegister, Physicians Data Query, and appropriate websites for ongoing trials. We searched conference abstracts and WorldCat for dissertations.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that recruited people following a cancer diagnosis. The intervention was any dietary advice provided by any method including group sessions, telephone instruction, written materials, or a web-based approach. We included comparisons that could be usual care or written information, and outcomes measured included overall survival, morbidities, secondary malignancies, dietary changes, anthropometry, quality of life (QoL), and biochemistry.
We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Two people independently assessed titles and full-text articles, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. For analysis, we used a random-effects statistical model for all meta-analyses, and the GRADE approach to rate the certainty of evidence, considering limitations, indirectness, inconsistencies, imprecision, and bias.
We included 25 RCTs involving 7259 participants including 977 (13.5%) men and 6282 (86.5%) women. Mean age reported ranged from 52.6 to 71 years, and range of age of included participants was 23 to 85 years. The trials reported 27 comparisons and included participants who had survived breast cancer (17 trials), colorectal cancer (2 trials), gynaecological cancer (1 trial), and cancer at mixed sites (5 trials). For overall survival, dietary intervention and control groups showed little or no difference in risk of mortality (hazard ratio (HR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77 to 1.23; 1 study; 3107 participants; low-certainty evidence). For secondary malignancies, dietary interventions versus control trials reported little or no difference (risk ratio (RR) 0.99, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.15; 1 study; 3107 participants; low-certainty evidence). Co-morbidities were not measured in any included trials. Subsequent outcomes reported after 12 months found that dietary interventions versus control probably make little or no difference in energy intake at 12 months (mean difference (MD) -59.13 kcal, 95% CI -159.05 to 37.79; 5 studies; 3283 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Dietary interventions versus control probably led to slight increases in fruit and vegetable servings (MD 0.41 servings, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.71; 5 studies; 834 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); mixed results for fibre intake overall (MD 5.12 g, 95% CI 0.66 to 10.9; 2 studies; 3127 participants; very low-certainty evidence); and likely improvement in Diet Quality Index (MD 3.46, 95% CI 1.54 to 5.38; 747 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). For anthropometry, dietary intervention versus control probably led to a slightly decreased body mass index (BMI) (MD -0.79 kg/m², 95% CI -1.50 to -0.07; 4 studies; 777 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Dietary interventions versus control probably had little or no effect on waist-to-hip ratio (MD -0.01, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.02; 2 studies; 106 participants; low-certainty evidence). For QoL, there were mixed results; several different quality assessment tools were used and evidence was of low to very low-certainty. No adverse events were reported in any of the included studies.
Evidence demonstrated little effects of dietary interventions on overall mortality and secondary cancers. For comorbidities, no evidence was identified. For nutritional outcomes, there was probably little or no effect on energy intake, although probably a slight increase in fruit and vegetable intake and Diet Quality Index. Results were mixed for fibre. For anthropometry, there was probably a slight decrease in body mass index (BMI) but probably little or no effect on waist-to-hip ratio. For QoL, results were highly varied. Additional high-quality research is needed to examine the effects of dietary interventions for different cancer sites, and to evaluate important outcomes including comorbidities and body composition. Evidence on new technologies used to deliver dietary interventions was limited.","Diet has been linked to cancer, and dietary guidelines are available for cancer prevention. People after cancer have been found to have higher rates of other conditions including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and other cancers. It is therefore sensible for people after cancer to look at changing their diet. It was important to undertake this review to assess the evidence on dietary advice for people who have survived cancer. This review evaluates evidence on dietary interventions for people after cancer. The quality of evidence is generally low to very low. Most studies did not evaluate dietary interventions for key review outcomes, particularly mortality and morbidity. However, a few study outcomes with moderate-certainty evidence focused on dietary intake and physical measurements. Included studies compared dietary interventions versus control or usual care. We pooled data from similar randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to provide a summary estimate of the effects of an intervention, and we judged how confident (certain) we were of these findings by using an established method (GRADE). We identified 25 RCTs involving 27 different comparisons. For some outcomes, we found absence of evidence for dietary interventions. We found some evidence showing that dietary interventions probably did not modify energy intake; however, some evidence shows what is probably a slight increase in fruit and vegetable intake (moderate-certainty evidence). Evidence on dietary fibre was mixed for different advice on weight reducing or healthy eating. Dietary interventions compared to control probably improved the Diet Quality Index (moderate-certainty evidence). For physical measurements, we found a probable reduction in body mass index (BMI) with dietary interventions compared to controls (moderate-certainty evidence) but little evidence showing any change in waist-to-hip ratio (low-certainty evidence). For quality of life (QoL), results were mixed due to the wide variety of tools used. No adverse events were reported. Available evidence shows that dietary interventions can be helpful in modifying fruit and vegetable servings and diet quality; modification of fibre intake was variable, and some benefits were seen for anthropometric measurements, including BMI. Most of the evidence is based on women with breast cancer, so more research is needed for patients with other cancers.

langcao2@illinois.edu,static_1,"Does cardiovascular training relieve cancer-related fatigue before, during, or after anticancer therapy?","To evaluate the effects of cardiovascular training on cancer-related fatigue (CRF), quality of life (QoL), adverse events, anxiety, and depression in people with cancer, with regard to their stage of anticancer therapy (before, during, or after), up to 12 weeks, up to six months, or longer, postintervention.
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov and World Health Organization ICTRP to identify studies that are included in the review. The latest search date was October 2023.
Moderate-certainty evidence shows that cardiovascular training by people with cancer during their anticancer therapy slightly reduces short-term CRF and results in little to no difference in short-term QoL. We do not know whether cardiovascular training increases or decreases medium-term CRF/QoL, and long-term CRF/QoL. There is very low-certainty evidence (due to heterogeneous definitions, reporting and measurement) evaluating whether the training increases or decreases adverse events. In people with cancer who perform cardiovascular training after anticancer therapy, we are uncertain about the effects on short-term CRF/QoL, long-term CRF/QoL, and adverse events. We identified a lack of evidence concerning cardiovascular training before anticancer therapy and on safety outcomes. The 36 ongoing and 12 completed, but unpublished, studies could help close this gap, and could contribute to improving the effect estimates and certainty.

Protocol available via DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD015211.","What is cancer-related fatigue? Cancer-related fatigue is an extreme feeling of tiredness over a long period of time. It can be caused by cancer treatment or the cancer itself. It is the most common symptom among people with cancer. It cannot be relieved by rest, and it affects the body and mind. What is cardiovascular training? Cardiovascular training is any activity that uses the large muscle groups of the buttocks and thighs, and increases heart and breathing rate. Examples are walking, running, cycling, and swimming. Why is cardiovascular training possibly effective for cancer-related fatigue? Cancer-related fatigue is linked to the body's response to cytokines, which regulate how tissues and organs increase in size (called cell growth). Cancer or cancer therapy may produce proteins called pro-inflammatory cytokines, which cause or worsen inflammation (the body's response to an injury or illness). Cardiovascular training can help reduce inflammation. What did we want to find out? We wanted to know whether cardiovascular training reduces cancer-related fatigue compared to no training. We explored the effects at short (up to 12 weeks), medium (up to six months), and long term (longer than six months). We also looked at quality of life, unwanted effects, anxiety, and depression. What did we do? We searched for studies that investigated cardiovascular training before, during, or after anticancer therapy compared to no training. These studies needed to evaluate cancer-related fatigue or quality of life, or both. The cardiovascular training needed at least five exercise sessions and had to be provided face-to-face, either in person or by video. We excluded studies with fewer than 20 people per group or studies only available in short-summary form. What did we find? We found 23 studies with 2135 people, mostly women with breast cancer. Most studies were conducted in high-income countries. A total of 1101 people received cardiovascular training and 1034 received no training. We also found 36 ongoing studies and 12 completed but unpublished studies. Main results: There were no studies comparing cardiovascular training before anticancer therapy with no training. We included 10 studies of cardiovascular training during anticancer therapy but could use only eight in our analyses. For cardiovascular training after anticancer therapy versus no training, we found 13 studies but could use only nine. Cardiovascular training during anticancer therapy probably reduces short-term cancer-related fatigue slightly (6 studies, 593 people) and probably results in little to no difference in short-term quality of life (6 studies, 612 people). It is unclear whether cardiovascular training affects medium- or long-term fatigue, quality of life, or unwanted effects. For cardiovascular training after anticancer therapy, we do not know whether it increases or decreases short- or long-term fatigue, quality of life, or unwanted effects, and no data were available for medium-term effects. What are the limitations of the evidence? We are moderately confident in the evidence on short-term fatigue and quality of life during anticancer therapy. Our confidence in all other results is very low because the studies were fewer, smaller, or had design limitations such as lack of blinding. There was no evidence for cardiovascular training before anticancer therapy or for medium-term effects after therapy.",1015,"cardiovascular training, cancer-related fatigue (CRF), quality of life (QoL), anticancer therapy, short-term CRF, medium-term CRF, long-term CRF, adverse events, anxiety, depression",What was the main focus of the study regarding cardiovascular training and its effects on people with cancer?,"What databases were searched to identify the studies included in the review, and when was the latest search conducted?",What were the findings of the study concerning the short-term effects of cardiovascular training on cancer-related fatigue and quality of life during anticancer therapy?
langcao2@illinois.edu,static_1,Degarelix for newly diagnosed advanced prostate cancer,"Degarelix is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist that leads to medical castration used to treat men with advanced or metastatic prostate cancer, or both. It is unclear how its effects compare to standard androgen suppression therapy. We assessed the effects of degarelix compared with standard androgen suppression therapy for men with advanced hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. We searched multiple databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, LILACS until September 2020), trial registries (until October 2020), and conference proceedings (until December 2020). We identified other potentially eligible trials by reference checking, citation searching, and contacting study authors. We included randomized controlled trials comparing degarelix with standard androgen suppression therapy for men with advanced prostate cancer. Three review authors independently classified studies and abstracted data from the included studies. The primary outcomes were overall survival and serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes were quality of life, cancer-specific survival, clinical progression, other adverse events, and biochemical progression. We used a random-effects model for meta-analyses and assessed the certainty of evidence for the main outcomes according to GRADE. We included 11 studies with a follow-up of between three and 14 months. We also identified five ongoing trials. Data to evaluate overall survival were not available. Degarelix may result in little to no difference in serious adverse events compared to standard androgen suppression therapy (risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 1.05; low-certainty evidence; 2750 participants). Based on 114 serious adverse events in the standard androgen suppression group, this corresponds to 23 fewer serious adverse events per 1000 participants (43 fewer to 6 more). We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations and imprecision. Degarelix likely results in little to no difference in quality of life assessed with a variety of validated questionnaires (standardized mean difference 0.06 higher, 95% CI 0.05 lower to 0.18 higher; moderate-certainty evidence; 2887 participants), with higher scores reflecting better quality of life. We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations. Data to evaluate cancer-specific survival were not available. The effects of degarelix on cardiovascular events are very uncertain (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.61; very low-certainty evidence; 80 participants). We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations, imprecision, and indirectness as this trial was conducted in a unique group of high-risk participants with pre-existing cardiovascular morbidities. Degarelix likely results in an increase in injection site pain (RR 15.68, 95% CI 7.41 to 33.17; moderate-certainty evidence; 2670 participants). Based on 30 participants per 1000 with injection site pain with standard androgen suppression therapy, this corresponds to 440 more injection site pains per 1000 participants (192 more to 965 more). We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations. We did not identify any relevant subgroup differences for different degarelix maintenance doses. We did not find trial evidence for overall survival or cancer-specific survival comparing degarelix to standard androgen suppression, but serious adverse events and quality of life may be similar between groups. The effects of degarelix on cardiovascular events are very uncertain as the only eligible study had limitations, was small with few events, and was conducted in a high-risk population. Degarelix likely results in an increase in injection site pain compared to standard androgen suppression therapy. Maximum follow-up of included studies was 14 months, which is short. There is a need for methodologically better designed and executed studies with long-term follow-up evaluating men with metastatic prostate cancer.","How does degarelix, a newer drug that treats prostate cancer by lowering male sex hormone levels, compare to existing medications for newly diagnosed advanced prostate cancer? There is no cure if prostate cancer has spread outside of the prostate gland to lymph nodes or to the bones. In such a situation, hormonal therapy that lowers levels of the male sex hormone testosterone can slow down cancer growth. Testosterone levels are regulated by complicated mechanisms that involve a hormone known as gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which is present in men at different levels at different times of the day. It is understood that giving men with prostate cancer high levels of medications that increase GnRH levels first raises testosterone levels, and then drops them to very low levels. These medications are commonly used to treat men with prostate cancer that has spread outside the prostate. Degarelix is a newer drug known as a GnRH antagonist, which blocks receptors in the brain and thereby lowers testosterone levels immediately. We included randomized controlled trials (studies in which participants are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) comparing degarelix and standard hormonal therapy in men with newly diagnosed advanced prostate cancer. The evidence is current to September 2020 for electronic databases, to October 2020 for trial registries, and to December 2020 for conference proceedings. We found 11 studies that were eligible for inclusion in the review, but none of these studies evaluated the risk of dying from any cause or dying from prostate cancer. There may be no difference between degarelix and standard hormonal therapy in serious unwanted effects and quality of life. The effects of degarelix on cardiovascular issues such as the risk of a heart attack or stroke are uncertain; while one study suggested that the risk may be reduced with degarelix, it had major issues, in particular that it was conducted in men at high risk for such problems. We found that degarelix therapy likely results in an increase in the occurrence of pain at the injection site. The certainty of evidence for the various outcomes ranged from moderate to very low. There is a need for additional, better designed studies to further understand the effects of degarelix for newly diagnosed advanced prostate cancer.",1024,"Degarelix, androgen suppression therapy, overall survival, serious adverse events, quality of life, cancer-specific survival, cardiovascular events, injection site pain, randomized controlled trials, metastatic prostate cancer.",What was the primary objective of the study regarding degarelix and standard androgen suppression therapy?,What methods were employed to gather data for the comparison between degarelix and standard androgen suppression therapy?,What were the key findings of the study concerning the adverse events and quality of life when using degarelix?
langcao2@illinois.edu,static_2,Best therapy for people with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who have not been treated without a targetable mutation and moderately impaired performance status,"Most people who are newly diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have advanced disease. For these people, survival is determined by various patient- and tumor-related factors, of which the performance status (PS) is the most important prognostic factor. People with PS 0 or 1 are usually treated with systemic therapies, whereas people with PS 3 or 4 most often receive supportive care. However, treatment for people with PS 2 without a targetable mutation remains unclear. Historically, people with a PS 2 cancer are frequently excluded from (important) clinical trials because of poorer outcomes and increased toxicity. We aim to address this knowledge gap, as this group of people represents a significant proportion (20% to 30%) of the total population with newly diagnosed lung cancer.
To identify the best first-line therapy for advanced lung cancer in people with performance status 2 without a targetable mutation or with an unknown mutation status.
We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 17 June 2022.
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared different chemotherapy (with or without angiogenesis inhibitor) or immunotherapy regimens, specifically designed for people with PS 2 only or studies including a subgroup of these people.
We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. overall survival (OS), 2. health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and 3. toxicity/adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were 4. tumor response rate, 5. progression-free survival, and 6. survival rates at six and 12 months' treatment. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence for each outcome.
We included 22 trials in this review and identified one ongoing trial. Twenty studies compared chemotherapy with different regimens, of which 11 compared non-platinum therapy (monotherapy or doublet) versus platinum doublet. We found no studies comparing best supportive care with chemotherapy and only two abstracts analyzing chemotherapy versus immunotherapy. We found that platinum doublet therapy showed superior OS compared to non-platinum therapy (hazard ratio [HR] 0.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.57 to 0.78; 7 trials, 697 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There were no differences in six-month survival rates (risk ratio [RR] 1.00, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.41; 6 trials, 632 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), whereas 12-month survival rates were improved for treatment with platinum doublet therapy (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.87 to 0.97; 11 trials, 1567 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). PFS and tumor response rate were also better for people treated with platinum doublet therapy, with moderate-certainty evidence (PFS: HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.77; 5 trials, 487 participants; tumor response rate: RR 2.25, 95% CI 1.67 to 3.05; 9 trials, 964 participants). When analyzing toxicity rates, we found that platinum doublet therapy increased grade 3 to 5 hematologic toxicities, all with low-certainty evidence (anemia: RR 1.98, 95% CI 1.00 to 3.92; neutropenia: RR 2.75, 95% CI 1.30 to 5.82; thrombocytopenia: RR 3.96, 95% CI 1.73 to 9.06; all 8 trials, 935 participants). Only four trials reported HRQoL data; however, the methodology was different per trial and we were unable to perform a meta-analysis. Although evidence is limited, there were no differences in 12-month survival rates or tumor response rates between carboplatin and cisplatin regimens. With an indirect comparison, carboplatin seemed to have better 12-month survival rates than cisplatin compared to non-platinum therapy. The assessment of the efficacy of immunotherapy in people with PS 2 was limited. There might be a place for single-agent immunotherapy, but the data provided by the included studies did not encourage the use of double-agent immunotherapy.
This review showed that as a first-line treatment for people with PS 2 with advanced NSCLC, platinum doublet therapy seems to be preferred over non-platinum therapy, with a higher response rate, PFS, and OS. Although the risk for grade 3 to 5 hematologic toxicity is higher, these events are often relatively mild and easy to treat. Since trials using checkpoint inhibitors in people with PS 2 are scarce, we identified an important knowledge gap regarding their role in people with advanced NSCLC and PS 2.","Lung cancer is the most frequent cause of cancer-related death worldwide and NSCLC is the most common subtype. At the time of diagnosis, the disease has already spread in more than half of all cases. In the tumors of a minority of people diagnosed with NSCLC that has spread to other parts of the body specific mutations can be found, which are treated distinct from the majority of people without such mutations.
NSCLC can only be treated with life-prolonging medicines such as chemotherapy (a medicine used to destroy cancer cells) or immunotherapy (a medicine that boosts the person's immune system and helps the body find and destroy cancer cells). Selecting the best treatment depends on the health condition of the person. That condition is determined using a scale from 0 (no symptoms) to 5 (dead). There is no discussion on the treatment of relatively fit people (scoring 0 or 1), as they often tolerate these treatments relatively well. People with a low health condition (scoring 3 or 4) receive only supportive care in most cases. However, although representing 20% to 30% of all people, the best treatment for moderately impaired people (PS 2) is not clear, as they often do not participate in trials.
Our objective was to investigate the best therapy for people with advanced NSCLC without a specific mutation with PS 2.
We searched medical databases for clinical trials comparing treatments for advanced NSCLC with best supportive care or other treatments.
We found 22 trials; 20 compared different types of chemotherapy and two compared chemotherapy versus immunotherapy.
People treated with chemotherapy regimens using two medicines, including a platinum-based medicine, had longer survival than people treated with chemotherapies without a platinum-based medicine. However, these people did have more side effects, especially with a negative influence on the bone marrow (matter found in the center of bones), resulting in a temporary lack of red and white blood cells, and platelets. The few studies that analyzed health-related quality of life all used different methods of measurement. We found no difference in quality of life when we looked at those studies individually. We found two partly published trials studying immunotherapy, which found no survival benefit compared to chemotherapy.
We are moderately confident in our results that chemotherapies with a platinum-based medicine increases survival. We are also moderately confident in the evidence evaluating the time to progression of disease because in all included studies, both investigators and trial participants were fully aware of which treatment the participants received. This might lead to substantial bias. In addition, we have little confidence in the evidence regarding toxicities because the evidence is based on a small number of studies with conflicting outcomes.

langcao2@illinois.edu,static_2,Cannabis-based medicines for cancer pain,"Pain is a common symptom in people with cancer; 30% to 50% of people with cancer will experience moderate-to-severe pain. This can have a major negative impact on their quality of life. Opioid (morphine-like) medications are commonly used to treat moderate or severe cancer pain, and are recommended for this purpose in the World Health Organization (WHO) pain treatment ladder. Pain is not sufficiently relieved by opioid medications in 10% to 15% of people with cancer. In people with insufficient relief of cancer pain, new analgesics are needed to effectively and safely supplement or replace opioids.
To evaluate the benefits and harms of cannabis-based medicines, including medical cannabis, for treating pain and other symptoms in adults with cancer compared to placebo or any other established analgesic for cancer pain.
We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 26 January 2023.
We selected double-blind randomised, controlled trials (RCT) of medical cannabis, plant-derived and synthetic cannabis-based medicines against placebo or any other active treatment for cancer pain in adults, with any treatment duration and at least 10 participants per treatment arm.
We used standard Cochrane methods. The primary outcomes were 1. proportions of participants reporting no worse than mild pain; 2. Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) of much improved or very much improved and 3. withdrawals due to adverse events. Secondary outcomes were 4. number of participants who reported pain relief of 30% or greater and overall opioid use reduced or stable; 5. number of participants who reported pain relief of 30% or greater, or 50% or greater; 6. pain intensity; 7. sleep problems; 8. depression and anxiety; 9. daily maintenance and breakthrough opioid dosage; 10. dropouts due to lack of efficacy; 11. all central nervous system adverse events. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence for each outcome.
We identified 14 studies involving 1823 participants. No study assessed the proportions of participants reporting no worse than mild pain on treatment by 14 days after start of treatment. We found five RCTs assessing oromucosal nabiximols (tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD)) or THC alone involving 1539 participants with moderate or severe pain despite opioid therapy. The double-blind periods of the RCTs ranged between two and five weeks. Four studies with a parallel design and 1333 participants were available for meta-analysis. There was moderate-certainty evidence that there was no clinically relevant benefit for proportions of PGIC much or very much improved (risk difference (RD) 0.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 0.12; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 16, 95% CI 8 to 100). There was moderate-certainty evidence for no clinically relevant difference in the proportion of withdrawals due to adverse events (RD 0.04, 95% CI 0 to 0.08; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 25, 95% CI 16 to endless). There was moderate-certainty evidence for no difference between nabiximols or THC and placebo in the frequency of serious adverse events (RD 0.02, 95% CI −0.03 to 0.07). There was moderate-certainty evidence that nabiximols and THC used as add-on treatment for opioid-refractory cancer pain did not differ from placebo in reducing mean pain intensity (standardised mean difference (SMD) −0.19, 95% CI −0.40 to 0.02). There was low-certainty evidence that a synthetic THC analogue (nabilone) delivered over eight weeks was not superior to placebo in reducing pain associated with chemotherapy or radiochemotherapy in people with head and neck cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (2 studies, 89 participants, qualitative analysis). Analyses of tolerability and safety were not possible for these studies. There was low-certainty evidence that synthetic THC analogues were superior to placebo (SMD −0.98, 95% CI −1.36 to −0.60), but not superior to low-dose codeine (SMD 0.03, 95% CI −0.25 to 0.32; 5 single-dose trials; 126 participants) in reducing moderate-to-severe cancer pain after cessation of previous analgesic treatment for three to four and a half hours (2 single-dose trials; 66 participants). Analyses of tolerability and safety were not possible for these studies. There was low-certainty evidence that CBD oil did not add value to specialist palliative care alone in the reduction of pain intensity in people with advanced cancer. There was no difference in the number of dropouts due to adverse events and serious adverse events (1 study, 144 participants, qualitative analysis). We found no studies using herbal cannabis.
There is moderate-certainty evidence that oromucosal nabiximols and THC are ineffective in relieving moderate-to-severe opioid-refractory cancer pain. There is low-certainty evidence that nabilone is ineffective in reducing pain associated with (radio-) chemotherapy in people with head and neck cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. There is low-certainty evidence that a single dose of synthetic THC analogues is not superior to a single low-dose morphine equivalent in reducing moderate-to-severe cancer pain. There is low-certainty evidence that CBD does not add value to specialist palliative care alone in the reduction of pain in people with advanced cancer.","One person in two or three who gets cancer will have pain that becomes moderate or severe in intensity. The pain tends to get worse as the cancer progresses.
The WHO recommends taking morphine-like medicines for moderate-to-severe pain from cancer, but 1 in 6 to 10 people with cancer pain do not experience sufficient pain relief from morphine-like medicines. Several products based on the cannabis plant have been suggested as treatment for cancer pain. These products include inhaled or orally ingested herbal cannabis, and various oils, sprays or tablets containing active cannabis ingredients obtained from the plant, or made synthetically. Some people with cancer pain have reported that CbMs are effective for them, and that is often highlighted in the media.
If CbMs relieved cancer pain in people living with cancer.
If CbMs were associated with any unwanted or harmful effects.
We searched for clinical trials that examined CbMs compared to other medications to treat cancer pain in adults.
We summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as the methods and size of studies.
We found 14 studies involving 1823 people. The biggest study included 399 people and the smallest study included 10 people.
Studies were conducted in countries around the world; most (six) were based in North America.
Five studies used one dose of CbM and lasted less than one day. Other studies lasted between two and eight weeks.
Pharmaceutical companies funded seven studies.
Six studies compared a mouth spray with a plant-derived combination of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the principal psychoactive constituent of cannabis, and cannabidiol (CBD), an anti-inflammatory ingredient of cannabis, against a fake medication (placebo). Seven studies compared an artificial cannabinoid mimicking the effects of THC against placebo. Of these seven studies, two studies compared against a morphine-like medication (codeine), too. One study compared CBD against placebo.
We did not find studies with herbal cannabis.
Mouth spray with a plant-derived combination of THC and CBD was probably not better than placebo in reducing pain in people with moderate-to-severe cancer pain despite opioid treatment. Thirty-two out of 100 people reported to be much or very much improved by cannabis-based mouth spray and 23 out of 100 people with mouth spray with placebo. A total of 19 out of 100 people withdrew early because of side effects by cannabis-based mouth spray and 16 out of 100 people by mouth spray with placebo. There was no difference in serious side effects between the cannabis-based mouth spray and a placebo mouth spray.
Artificial cannabinoid mimicking the effects of THC may not be better than a fake medication in reducing pain associated with chemotherapy or radiochemotherapy in people with head and neck cancer and a certain type of lung cancer.
A single dose of an artificial cannabinoid mimicking the effects of THC may be better than a single dose of placebo, but may not differ from a single small dose of a morphine-like medication in reducing moderate-to-severe cancer pain after cessation of previous analgesic treatment for three to four and a half hours.
CBD may not add value to specialist palliative care alone in the reduction of pain in people with advanced cancer.
We found no studies with medical cannabis.
We are moderately confident in the evidence that a mouth spray with a plant-derived combination of THC and CBD does not reduce severe cancer pain despite opioid treatment because studies did not provide information about everything that we could have used.
We have little confidence in the evidence that an artificial cannabinoid mimicking the effects of THC (nabilone) does not reduce pain associated with chemotherapy or radiochemotherapy because the studies did not provide data about everything that we could have used, and because the studies were small.
We have little confidence in the evidence that artificial cannabinoids mimicking the effects of THC reduce cancer pain after the previous pain-relieving medication was stopped some hours before because the studies did not provide data about everything that we could have used, and because the studies were small.
We have little confidence in the evidence that CBD added to standard palliative care does not reduce cancer pain because there was only one study available.

langcao2@illinois.edu,static_2,Selenium for preventing cancer,"This review is the third update of the Cochrane review ""Selenium for preventing cancer"". Selenium is a naturally occurring element with both nutritional and toxicological properties. Higher selenium exposure and selenium supplements have been suggested to protect against several types of cancer.
To gather and present evidence needed to address two research questions: 1. What is the aetiological relationship between selenium exposure and cancer risk in humans?2. Describe the efficacy of selenium supplementation for cancer prevention in humans.
We updated electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 2), MEDLINE (Ovid, 2013 to January 2017, week 4), and Embase (2013 to 2017, week 6), as well as searches of clinical trial registries.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and longitudinal observational studies that enrolled adult participants.
We performed random-effects (RE) meta-analyses when two or more RCTs were available for a specific outcome. We conducted RE meta-analyses when five or more observational studies were available for a specific outcome. We assessed risk of bias in RCTs and in observational studies using Cochrane's risk assessment tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, respectively. We considered in the primary analysis data pooled from RCTs with low risk of bias. We assessed the certainty of evidence by using the GRADE approach.
We included 83 studies in this updated review: two additional RCTs (10 in total) and a few additional trial reports for previously included studies. RCTs involved 27,232 participants allocated to either selenium supplements or placebo. For analyses of RCTs with low risk of bias, the summary risk ratio (RR) for any cancer incidence was 1.01 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.10; 3 studies, 19,475 participants; high-certainty evidence). The RR for estimated cancer mortality was 1.02 (95% CI 0.80 to 1.30; 1 study, 17,448 participants). For the most frequently investigated site-specific cancers, investigators provided little evidence of any effect of selenium supplementation. Two RCTs with 19,009 participants indicated that colorectal cancer was unaffected by selenium administration (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.43), as were non-melanoma skin cancer (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.30 to 4.42; 2 studies, 2027 participants), lung cancer (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.50; 2 studies, 19,009 participants), breast cancer (RR 2.04, 95% CI 0.44 to 9.55; 1 study, 802 participants), bladder cancer (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.52; 2 studies, 19,009 participants), and prostate cancer (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.14; 4 studies, 18,942 participants). Certainty of the evidence was high for all of these cancer sites, except for breast cancer, which was of moderate certainty owing to imprecision, and non-melanoma skin cancer, which we judged as moderate certainty owing to high heterogeneity. RCTs with low risk of bias suggested increased melanoma risk. Results for most outcomes were similar when we included all RCTs in the meta-analysis, regardless of risk of bias. Selenium supplementation did not reduce overall cancer incidence (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.14; 5 studies, 21,860 participants) nor mortality (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.32; 2 studies, 18,698 participants). Summary RRs for site-specific cancers showed limited changes compared with estimates from high-quality studies alone, except for liver cancer, for which results were reversed. In the largest trial, the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Trial, selenium supplementation increased risks of alopecia and dermatitis, and for participants with highest background selenium status, supplementation also increased risk of high-grade prostate cancer. RCTs showed a slightly increased risk of type 2 diabetes associated with supplementation. A hypothesis generated by the Nutritional Prevention of Cancer Trial - that individuals with low blood selenium levels could reduce their risk of cancer (particularly prostate cancer) by increasing selenium intake - has not been confirmed. As RCT participants have been overwhelmingly male (88%), we could not assess the potential influence of sex or gender. We included 15 additional observational cohort studies (70 in total; over 2,360,000 participants). We found that lower cancer incidence (summary odds ratio (OR) 0.72, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.93; 7 studies, 76,239 participants) and lower cancer mortality (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.97; 7 studies, 183,863 participants) were associated with the highest category of selenium exposure compared with the lowest. Cancer incidence was lower in men (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.14, 4 studies, 29,365 men) than in women (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.77, 2 studies, 18,244 women). Data show a decrease in risk of site-specific cancers for stomach, colorectal, lung, breast, bladder, and prostate cancers. However, these studies have major weaknesses due to study design, exposure misclassification, and potential unmeasured confounding due to lifestyle or nutritional factors covarying with selenium exposure beyond those taken into account in multi-variable analyses. In addition, no evidence of a dose-response relation between selenium status and cancer risk emerged. Certainty of evidence was very low for each outcome. Some studies suggested that genetic factors might modify the relation between selenium and cancer risk - an issue that merits further investigation.
Well-designed and well-conducted RCTs have shown no beneficial effect of selenium supplements in reducing cancer risk (high certainty of evidence). Some RCTs have raised concerns by reporting a higher incidence of high-grade prostate cancer and type 2 diabetes in participants with selenium supplementation. No clear evidence of an influence of baseline participant selenium status on outcomes has emerged in these studies. Observational longitudinal studies have shown an inverse association between selenium exposure and risk of some cancer types, but null and direct relations have also been reported, and no systematic pattern suggesting dose-response relations has emerged. These studies suffer from limitations inherent to the observational design, including exposure misclassification and unmeasured confounding. Overall, there is no evidence to suggest that increasing selenium intake through diet or supplementation prevents cancer in humans. However, more research is needed to assess whether selenium may modify the risk of cancer in individuals with a specific genetic background or nutritional status, and to investigate possible differential effects of various forms of selenium.","We reviewed the evidence investigating the relation between selenium intake and cancer prevention. This review updates the most recent Cochrane review on this topic (Vinceti 2014, which was an update of Dennert 2011.
Selenium is a naturally occurring element that individuals are exposed to mainly through food consumption, although exposure can also occur through air, drinking water, and dietary supplements. Small amounts of selenium are essential for certain biological functions in humans, but slightly higher amounts can pose a toxicity risk, making selenium an element with a narrow, but as yet not well-defined, safe range of exposure. Selenium occurs in many different chemical forms with different biological activity. From the late 1960s, a few observational studies reported that people with high levels of selenium in their diet or in their body tissues had lower risk of cancer, and some laboratory studies showed that selenium could inhibit the growth of cancer cells. This led to widespread interest in selenium supplements and claims that taking such supplements could prevent cancer. Since that time, many more observational studies have been conducted to compare cancer rates among individuals with high and low selenium exposure. More recently, several randomised controlled trials designed to assess whether selenium supplementation can prevent cancer have been carried out. These trials played a major role in enhancing our understanding of the relation between selenium and cancer risk as a result of their stronger study design as compared with observational studies. The most recent trials in particular have shown high methodological quality and statistical power. Several trials focused on whether selenium could prevent prostate cancer.
This review includes 10 trials in which adults were randomly assigned to receive selenium supplements or placebo, and 70 observational studies in which adults were followed over time to determine whether their baseline selenium status was associated with their risk of cancer. The evidence is current to January 2017.
All of the high-quality randomised trials reported no effect of selenium on reducing overall risk of cancer or risk of particular cancers, including the most investigated outcome - prostate cancer. Some trials unexpectedly suggested that selenium may increase risks of high-grade prostate cancer, type 2 diabetes, and dermatological abnormalities.
Observational studies have yielded inconsistent evidence of a possible effect of selenium exposure on cancer risk, with no evidence of a dose-response relation. When we pooled results of these studies, overall they suggested an inverse relation between cancer exposure and subsequent incidence of any cancer or some specific cancers, such as colon and prostate cancer. However, observational studies have major weaknesses. The selenium exposure status of participants could have been misclassified owing to limitations of the indicators of selenium exposure used, as well as to uncertainty regarding the particular selenium species contributing to overall exposure. In addition, unmeasured confounding from lifestyle or nutritional factors - a major and well-known source of bias in nutritional epidemiology studies of observational design - could have been present. Therefore, the internal validity of these studies is limited.
Currently, the hypothesis that increasing selenium intake may reduce cancer risk is not supported by epidemiological evidence. Additional research is needed to assess whether selenium may affect the risk of cancer in individuals with specific genetic backgrounds or nutritional status, and to determine how the various chemical forms of selenium compounds may have different effects on cancer risk.",1025,"Selenium supplementation, Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), Cancer risk, Observational studies, High-certainty evidence, Site-specific cancers, Cancer incidence, Cancer prevention, Meta-analyses, Genetic factors.",What were the main research questions this study aimed to examine regarding selenium and cancer?,What methods did the study use to gather and analyze data related to selenium's effects on cancer prevention?,What were the key findings about the efficacy of selenium supplementation in reducing cancer risk according to the study?

Two review authors independently identified articles, extracted data, and carried out the 'Risk of bias' assessment. We conducted meta-analyses using a fixed-effect model unless there was substantial heterogeneity, in which case we also performed a random-effects analysis as a sensitivity analysis.
Twenty-two trials met the inclusion criteria. Ten of these exclusively recruited people with EGFR M+ NSCLC; the remainder recruited a mixed population and reported results for people with EGFR M+ NSCLC as subgroup analyses. The number of participants with EGFR M+ tumours totalled 3023, of whom approximately 2563 were of Asian origin. Overall survival (OS) data showed inconsistent results between the included trials that compared EGFR-targeted treatments against cytotoxic chemotherapy or placebo. Erlotinib was used in eight trials, gefitinib in nine trials, afatinib in two trials, cetuximab in two trials, and icotinib in one trial. The findings of FASTACT 2 suggested a clinical benefit for OS for participants treated with erlotinib plus cytotoxic chemotherapy when compared to cytotoxic chemotherapy alone, as did the Han 2017 trial for gefitinib plus cytotoxic chemotherapy, but both results were based on a small number of participants (n = 97 and 122, respectively). For progression-free survival (PFS), a pooled analysis of four trials showed evidence of clinical benefit for erlotinib compared with cytotoxic chemotherapy (hazard ratio (HR) 0.31; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25 to 0.39 ; 583 participants ; high-certainty evidence). A pooled analysis of two trials of gefitinib versus paclitaxel plus carboplatin showed evidence of clinical benefit for PFS for gefitinib (HR 0.39; 95% CI 0.32 to 0.48 ; 491 participants high-certainty evidence), and a pooled analysis of two trials of gefitinib versus pemetrexed plus carboplatin with pemetrexed maintenance also showed evidence of clinical benefit for PFS for gefitinib (HR 0.59; 95% CI 0.46 to 0.74, 371 participants ; moderate-certainty evidence). Afatinib showed evidence of clinical benefit for PFS when compared with chemotherapy in a pooled analysis of two trials (HR 0.42; 95% CI 0.34 to 0.53, 709 participants high-certainty evidence). All but one small trial showed a corresponding improvement in response rate with tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) compared to chemotherapy. Commonly reported grade 3/4 adverse events associated with afatinib, erlotinib, gefitinib and icotinib monotherapy were rash and diarrhoea. Myelosuppression was consistently worse in the chemotherapy arms; fatigue and anorexia were also associated with some chemotherapies. Seven trials reported on health-related quality of life and symptom improvement using different methodologies. For each of erlotinib, gefitinib, and afatinib, two trials showed improvement in one or more indices for the TKI compared to chemotherapy. The quality of evidence was high for the comparisons of erlotinib and gefitinib with cytotoxic chemotherapy and for the comparison of afatinib with cytotoxic chemotherapy.
Erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib and icotinib are all active agents in EGFR M+ NSCLC patients, and demonstrate an increased tumour response rate and prolonged PFS compared to cytotoxic chemotherapy. We found a beneficial effect of the TKI compared to cytotoxic chemotherapy in adverse effect and health-related quality of life. We found limited evidence for increased OS for the TKI when compared with standard chemotherapy, but the majority of the included trials allowed participants to switch treatments on disease progression, which will have a confounding effect on any OS analysis. Single agent-TKI remains the standard of care and the benefit of combining a TKI and chemotherapy remains uncertain as the evidence is based on small patient numbers. Cytotoxic chemotherapy is less effective in EGFR M+ NSCLC than erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib or icotinib and is associated with greater toxicity. There are no data supporting the use of monoclonal antibody therapy. Icotinib is not available outside China.","Lung cancer is the most common cancer in the world. It has often spread by the time it is diagnosed. Therefore, surgery is usually not possible and drug treatment, typically chemotherapy, is needed. The commonest type of lung cancer is non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Around 10% to 15% of people with NSCLC will have a specific kind of cancer known as epidermal growth factor receptor positive (EGFR M+), in which there are changes in the cancer cells to the genes controlling tumour growth. In this review, we looked at new treatments that can target EGFR M+ NSCLC to find out how well they work.
The purpose of this review was to find out whether people given treatments targeted at EGFR M+ NSCLC live longer and have a better health-related quality of life than people having standard chemotherapy.
We found 22 trials that looked at five different EGFR-targeted drugs and compared them with standard chemotherapy treatment: erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib, icotinib and the antibody cetuximab. We included trials reporting results up to 27 July 2020.
Our results showed that people given erlotinib, gefitinib,afatinib or icotinib have a longer time before the cancer progresses and experience fewer side effects than those people given standard chemotherapy. However, we could not be sure whether people given erlotinib, afatinib or icotinib live any longer than those given standard chemotherapy.
Erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib and icotinib delay further spread of EGFR M+ lung cancer and improve health-related quality of life.

langcao2@illinois.edu,interactive_3,Treatment options for people with recurrent and progressive glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly malignant brain tumour that almost always progresses or recurs after standard first-line treatment, and there is no consensus on the most effective therapy once the disease returns. This review evaluated available treatments for first and later recurrence in people previously treated with the standard Stupp protocol and included a brief economic commentary. Searches of major medical databases up to December 2019 identified 42 eligible studies (34 randomised trials and 8 non-randomised studies) involving 5236 participants. Most randomised trials had low risk of bias, while non-randomised studies had high risk of bias. Treatments included chemotherapy, re-operation, re-irradiation, and novel therapies used alone or in combination. For first recurrence, 11 treatments contributed to the overall survival network analysis and eight to the progression-free survival analysis, with lomustine (LOM/CCNU) used as the reference treatment. No included studies in the network meta-analysis evaluated surgery, re-irradiation, PCV, temozolomide (TMZ) rechallenge, or best supportive care, and quality-of-life data were sparse. Median overall survival ranged from 5.5 to 12.6 months and median progression-free survival from 1.5 to 4.2 months. No high-certainty evidence showed any treatment improved survival compared with lomustine. Bevacizumab plus lomustine probably resulted in little or no difference in survival compared with lomustine alone, though it may improve progression-free survival. Bevacizumab alone may offer little or no survival benefit, and evidence remains uncertain. Regorafenib may improve overall survival compared with lomustine but evidence certainty was low. Temozolomide plus Depatux-M (ABT414) may improve survival compared with lomustine or bevacizumab, possibly driven by the temozolomide component, but additional evidence is needed. Fotemustine may have similar effects to lomustine. Evidence for bevacizumab plus irinotecan was very uncertain, and it likely offers little benefit over bevacizumab alone. Ranking analyses placed fotemustine first, followed by bevacizumab plus lomustine, lomustine alone, bevacizumab plus irinotecan, and bevacizumab alone, though ranking does not reflect evidence certainty. Three studies examining re-operation suggested it may extend survival in carefully selected patients. One early-phase study suggested a potential role for a cannabinoid plus temozolomide. Evidence for treatment of second or later recurrence was limited; some heterogeneous studies suggested radiotherapy with or without bevacizumab may improve survival, while tumour-treating fields showed little difference compared with physician�s choice. No reliable evidence was found for best supportive care. Severe adverse events were significantly more common with bevacizumab plus lomustine than with lomustine alone and were similarly high with cediranib plus lomustine. Lomustine alone had the lowest rate of severe adverse events, followed by regorafenib. Combinations that added novel agents to bevacizumab generally increased toxicity. Overall, combination treatments for first recurrence did not improve survival compared with lomustine monotherapy and were often associated with more severe adverse events. Re-operation and re-irradiation may benefit selected individuals. Evidence for later recurrences remains sparse, and more high-quality research is needed.","Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a very aggressive brain tumour that often continues to grow even after surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, and almost always comes back. Many different treatments have been tested for tumour progression or recurrence, but there is no agreement on which option is best. This review evaluated treatments for people whose GBM progressed or recurred after receiving standard initial care. A total of 42 studies involving 5236 people were included. Treatments examined included chemotherapy, re-operation, re-irradiation, and newer therapies used alone or in combination. For first recurrence, none of the treatments showed clear evidence of being better than lomustine (CCNU). Adding bevacizumab to lomustine did not improve overall survival, and most other agents either had uncertain benefits or did not improve outcomes. Several commonly used treatments such as PCV and temozolomide re-challenge were not represented in the available evidence. Limited evidence suggested that a second surgery, with or without additional therapies, may offer some survival benefit in selected individuals. For second or later recurrence, evidence was too limited for statistical analysis, but radiotherapy with or without bevacizumab might offer some benefit, though this is uncertain. Serious side effects occurred with many treatments, and combining bevacizumab with lomustine resulted in more severe adverse events than lomustine alone. Overall, lomustine appears to be the most effective chemotherapy option for first recurrence, and other combination therapies generally carried higher risks without clear benefits. A second surgery or radiotherapy may be helpful for some individuals. For later recurrences, evidence is sparse and uncertain. More research is needed, especially for commonly used treatments not evaluated in the included studies.",1022,"Glioblastoma, Standard Stupp protocol, Overall survival, Progression-free survival, Lomustine, Bevacizumab, Regorafenib, Temozolomide, Re-operation, Re-irradiation",What was the objective of the review on treatments for glioblastoma recurrence?,What methods were utilized to evaluate the treatments for glioblastoma recurrence in the review?,What were the key findings regarding the effectiveness and safety of different treatments compared to lomustine for glioblastoma recurrence?
langcao2@illinois.edu,interactive_3,Exercise-based rehabilitation for coronary heart disease,"Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the most common cause of death globally. However, with falling CHD mortality rates, an increasing number of people living with CHD may need support to manage their symptoms and prognosis. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) aims to improve the health and outcomes of people with CHD. This is an update of a Cochrane Review previously published in 2016. To assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of exercise-based CR (exercise training alone or in combination with psychosocial or educational interventions) compared with 'no exercise' control, on mortality, morbidity and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in people with CHD. We updated searches from the previous Cochrane Review, by searching CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two other databases in September 2020. We also searched two clinical trials registers in June 2021. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of exercise-based interventions with at least six months� follow-up, compared with 'no exercise' control. The study population comprised adult men and women who have had a myocardial infarction (MI), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), or have angina pectoris, or coronary artery disease. We screened all identified references, extracted data and assessed risk of bias according to Cochrane methods. We stratified meta-analysis by duration of follow-up: short-term (6 to 12 months); medium-term (> 12 to 36 months); and long-term (> 3 years), and used meta-regression to explore potential treatment effect modifiers. We used GRADE for primary outcomes at 6 to 12 months (the most common follow-up time point). This review included 85 trials which randomised 23,430 people with CHD. This latest update identified 22 new trials (7795 participants). The population included predominantly post-MI and post-revascularisation patients, with a mean age ranging from 47 to 77 years. In the last decade, the median percentage of women with CHD has increased from 11% to 17%, but females still account for a similarly small percentage of participants recruited overall (< 15%). Twenty-one of the included trials were performed in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Overall trial reporting was poor, although there was evidence of an improvement in quality over the last decade. The median longest follow-up time was 12 months (range 6 months to 19 years). At short-term follow-up (6 to 12 months), exercise-based CR likely results in a slight reduction in all-cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 1.04; 25 trials; moderate certainty evidence), a large reduction in MI (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.93; 22 trials; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 75, 95% CI 47 to 298; high certainty evidence), and a large reduction in all-cause hospitalisation (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.77; 14 trials; NNTB 12, 95% CI 9 to 21; moderate certainty evidence). Exercise-based CR likely results in little to no difference in risk of cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.14; 15 trials; moderate certainty evidence), CABG (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.27; 20 trials; high certainty evidence), and PCI (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.19; 13 trials; moderate certainty evidence) up to 12 months' follow-up. We are uncertain about the effects of exercise-based CR on cardiovascular hospitalisation, with a wide confidence interval including considerable benefit as well as harm (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.59; low certainty evidence). There was evidence of substantial heterogeneity across trials for cardiovascular hospitalisations (I� = 53%), and of small study bias for all-cause hospitalisation, but not for all other outcomes. At medium-term follow-up, although there may be little to no difference in all-cause mortality (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.02; 15 trials), MI (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.27; 12 trials), PCI (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.35; 6 trials), CABG (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.23; 9 trials), and all-cause hospitalisation (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.03; 9 trials), a large reduction in cardiovascular mortality was found (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.93; 5 trials). Evidence is uncertain for difference in risk of cardiovascular hospitalisation (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.12; 3 trials). At long-term follow-up, although there may be little to no difference in all-cause mortality (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.10), exercise-based CR may result in a large reduction in cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.78; 8 trials) and MI (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.90; 10 trials). Evidence is uncertain for CABG (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.27; 4 trials), and PCI (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.20; 3 trials). Meta-regression showed benefits in outcomes were independent of CHD case mix, type of CR, exercise dose, follow-up length, publication year, CR setting, study location, sample size or risk of bias. There was evidence that exercise-based CR may slightly increase HRQoL across several subscales (SF-36 mental component, physical functioning, physical performance, general health, vitality, social functioning and mental health scores) up to 12 months' follow-up; however, these may not be clinically important differences. The eight trial-based economic evaluation studies showed exercise-based CR to be a potentially cost-effective use of resources in terms of gain in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). This updated Cochrane Review supports the conclusions of the previous version, that exercise-based CR provides important benefits to people with CHD, including reduced risk of MI, a likely small reduction in all-cause mortality, and a large reduction in all-cause hospitalisation, along with associated healthcare costs, and improved HRQoL up to 12 months' follow-up. Over longer-term follow-up, benefits may include reductions in cardiovascular mortality and MI. In the last decade, trials were more likely to include females, and be undertaken in LMICs, increasing the generalisability of findings. Well-designed, adequately-reported RCTs of CR in people with CHD more representative of usual clinical practice are still needed. Trials should explicitly report clinical outcomes, including mortality and hospital admissions, and include validated HRQoL outcome measures, especially over longer-term follow-up, and assess costs and cost-effectiveness.","Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the single most common cause of death globally. However, with falling CHD mortality rates, an increasing number of people live with CHD and may need support to manage their symptoms (such as angina, shortness of breath with physical activity, and fatigue) and reduce the chances of future problems, such as heart attacks. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (exercise training alone or in combination with psychological or educational interventions) aims to improve the health and outcomes of people with CHD. We searched the scientific literature for randomised controlled trials (experiments that randomly allocate participants to one of two or more treatment groups) looking at the effectiveness of exercise-based treatments compared with no exercise in people of all ages with CHD. The evidence is current to September 2020. This latest update identified an additional 22 trials (7795 participants). We included a total of 85 trials that studied 23,430 people with CHD, predominantly heart attack survivors and those who had undergone heart bypass surgery or angioplasty (a procedure which widens narrowed or obstructed arteries or veins). Thirty-eight (45%) of the trials involved exercise-only interventions and 47 (55%) involved interventions with exercise plus other components. The type of exercise most often included was stationary cycling, walking or circuit training. Twenty-one (25%) of the interventions were delivered in the participants' homes. The findings of this update are consistent with the previous (2016) version of this Cochrane Review, and show important benefits of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation that include a reduction in the risk of death due to any cause, heart attack, and hospital admission, and improvements in health-related quality of life, compared with not undertaking exercise. A small body of economic evidence was identified, indicating exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation to be cost-effective. Many of the studies identified in this current update were undertaken in low- and middle-income countries, which increases the generalisability of our results to these settings where levels of CHD are high and continue to increase. Although the reporting of methods has improved in recent trials, lack of reporting key methodological aspects made it difficult to assess the overall methodological quality and risk of possible bias of the evidence.",1031,"Coronary heart disease (CHD), exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR), all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), health-related quality of life (HRQoL), randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cardiovascular mortality, cost-effectiveness, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).",What was the study trying to examine regarding exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation in people with coronary heart disease?,What methods were used in the study to assess the effectiveness of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation?,What results were found in the study concerning the impact of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation on mortality and hospitalisation in people with coronary heart disease?
langcao2@illinois.edu,interactive_3,Biosimilar monoclonal antibodies for cancer treatment in adults,"Biosimilars are products that contain an approved biological medicine and are similar, but not identical, to the original version (the originator). In cancer, biosimilars have been developed from the monoclonal antibodies bevacizumab, rituximab, and trastuzumab, and they are now available for treating lung, colorectal, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and breast cancers. Because biological products cannot be made identically, it is important to evaluate the clinical effects of biosimilars compared with their originators to understand their benefits and harms. We evaluated the benefits and harms of biosimilar monoclonal antibodies versus their originators in adults with cancer. We searched major medical and clinical trial databases up to February 2024 for randomized controlled trials comparing biosimilars to originators. Standard Cochrane methods were used. The primary outcomes were progression-free survival, duration of response, overall survival, pathological complete response in breast cancer, serious adverse events, and health-related quality of life. We included 55 studies with 22,046 adults: 23 studies of bevacizumab involving 10,639 participants with colorectal or lung cancer, 17 studies of rituximab involving 4412 participants with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 15 studies of trastuzumab involving 6995 participants with breast cancer. Studies took place worldwide, were mostly multicentre, and all were funded by manufacturers. Participants ranged in age from 47 to 62 years, and the percentage of women ranged from 18% to 100%. Fifteen studies used non-inferiority designs and 40 used equivalence designs. Overall risk of bias was low, with most concerns related to incomplete outcome data and selective reporting. For bevacizumab in lung or colorectal cancer, progression-free survival was likely similar between biosimilars and originators, with equal numbers per 1000 at 12 months and a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.00. Duration of response and overall survival were also likely similar, and serious adverse events showed no important differences. Health-related quality of life was evaluated in only one colorectal cancer study and results were similar. Objective response and mortality were likely similar as well. For rituximab in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, biosimilars were likely similar to originators for progression-free survival, duration of response, overall survival, serious adverse events, objective response, and mortality. No studies reported quality of life. For trastuzumab in breast cancer, biosimilars were likely similar to originators for progression-free survival, duration of response, overall survival, serious adverse events, and objective response, and may be similar for pathological complete response. No studies reported quality of life. Across bevacizumab, rituximab, and trastuzumab, biosimilars were generally similar to their originators in progression-free survival, duration of response, overall survival, serious adverse events, objective response, and mortality. Evidence for pathological complete response (trastuzumab) and quality of life (bevacizumab) was limited. Overall, evidence certainty was moderate, with imprecision being the main reason for downgrading confidence.","Biological medicines used in cancer treatment are made from living organisms and work by killing cancer cells. Biosimilars are medicines that are similar to the original biological medicine, known as the originator. Although biosimilars have slightly different structures, they target cancer cells in the same way. Originator medicines, sometimes called reference or innovator medicines, receive approval before biosimilars. Unlike generic medicines, which are chemically derived and easier to replicate, originators and biosimilars are biological medicines, making it more difficult to create identical copies. However, biosimilars are often cheaper and could improve access to effective cancer treatment if they provide similar benefits and harms. We wanted to compare the benefits and harms of bevacizumab, rituximab, and trastuzumab biosimilars with their originators. Based on the input from five people with cancer, we considered several outcomes critical for clinical decisions: the length of time cancer does not grow or spread after treatment, the length of time people remain cancer-free, overall survival, the number of people whose breast cancer disappears in tissue removed during surgery, severe unwanted effects, and well-being. We also identified outcomes important for decision-making: the number of people whose cancer shrinks or disappears, death, and the time until cancer grows or spreads or until death. We searched for studies comparing biosimilars of bevacizumab, rituximab, or trastuzumab with the originators in people with lung, colorectal, non-Hodgkin�s lymphoma, and breast cancers, summarized the results, and rated our confidence in the evidence. We found 55 studies with 22,046 participants, including 10,639 receiving bevacizumab for advanced or metastatic lung cancer, 4412 receiving rituximab mainly for non-Hodgkin�s lymphoma, and 6995 receiving trastuzumab for advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Participants were 47 to 62 years old on average, and the studies took place across Asia, Europe, and North and South America. All studies were funded by the companies manufacturing the biosimilars. Receiving biosimilars or originator medicines led to similar results overall, and we are moderately confident that biosimilars are as effective as the originators in treating cancer. We set narrow criteria to judge whether results were sufficiently similar, and while most comparisons did not fall fully within this range, overall findings still support similarity. Most studies were well conducted, but a few may have allowed participants to know which treatment they received, and some studies did not report all outcomes of interest.",1018,"biosimilars, monoclonal antibodies, progression-free survival, overall survival, serious adverse events, health-related quality of life, pathological complete response, randomized controlled trials, duration of response, hazard ratio",What was the study attempting to examine with regard to biosimilar monoclonal antibodies and their originators in adults with cancer?,What methods were used to gather and analyze data in the study comparing biosimilars to originators?,"What were the findings of the study concerning the similarity between biosimilars and originators in progression-free survival, duration of response, and overall survival?"
langcao2@illinois.edu,interactive_4,Green tea for the prevention of cancer,"This review is an update of a previously published review in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009, Issue 3).Tea is one of the most commonly consumed beverages worldwide. Teas from the plant Camellia sinensis can be grouped into green, black and oolong tea, and drinking habits vary cross-culturally. C sinensis contains polyphenols, one subgroup being catechins. Catechins are powerful antioxidants, and laboratory studies have suggested that these compounds may inhibit cancer cell proliferation. Some experimental and nonexperimental epidemiological studies have suggested that green tea may have cancer-preventative effects.
To assess possible associations between green tea consumption and the risk of cancer incidence and mortality as primary outcomes, and safety data and quality of life as secondary outcomes.
We searched eligible studies up to January 2019 in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and reference lists of previous reviews and included studies.
We included all epidemiological studies, experimental (i.e. randomised controlled trials (RCTs)) and nonexperimental (non-randomised studies, i.e. observational studies with both cohort and case-control design) that investigated the association of green tea consumption with cancer risk or quality of life, or both.
Two or more review authors independently applied the study criteria, extracted data and assessed methodological quality of studies. We summarised the results according to diagnosis of cancer type.
In this review update, we included in total 142 completed studies (11 experimental and 131 nonexperimental) and two ongoing studies. This is an additional 10 experimental and 85 nonexperimental studies from those included in the previous version of the review. Eleven experimental studies allocated a total of 1795 participants to either green tea extract or placebo, all demonstrating an overall high methodological quality based on 'Risk of bias' assessment. For incident prostate cancer, the summary risk ratio (RR) in the green tea-supplemented participants was 0.50 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 1.36), based on three studies and involving 201 participants (low-certainty evidence). The summary RR for gynaecological cancer was 1.50 (95% CI 0.41 to 5.48; 2 studies, 1157 participants; low-certainty evidence). No evidence of effect of non-melanoma skin cancer emerged (summary RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.92; 1 study, 1075 participants; low-certainty evidence). In addition, adverse effects of green tea extract intake were reported, including gastrointestinal disorders, elevation of liver enzymes, and, more rarely, insomnia, raised blood pressure and skin/subcutaneous reactions. Consumption of green tea extracts induced a slight improvement in quality of life, compared with placebo, based on three experimental studies. In nonexperimental studies, we included over 1,100,000 participants from 46 cohort studies and 85 case-control studies, which were on average of intermediate to high methodological quality based on Newcastle-Ottawa Scale 'Risk of bias' assessment. When comparing the highest intake of green tea with the lowest, we found a lower overall cancer incidence (summary RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.07), based on three studies, involving 52,479 participants (low-certainty evidence). Conversely, we found no association between green tea consumption and cancer-related mortality (summary RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.07), based on eight studies and 504,366 participants (low-certainty evidence). For most of the site-specific cancers we observed a decreased RR in the highest category of green tea consumption compared with the lowest one. After stratifying the analysis according to study design, we found strongly conflicting results for some cancer sites: oesophageal, prostate and urinary tract cancer, and leukaemia showed an increased RR in cohort studies and a decreased RR or no difference in case-control studies.
Overall, findings from experimental and nonexperimental epidemiological studies yielded inconsistent results, thus providing limited evidence for the beneficial effect of green tea consumption on the overall risk of cancer or on specific cancer sites. Some evidence of a beneficial effect of green tea at some cancer sites emerged from the RCTs and from case-control studies, but their methodological limitations, such as the low number and size of the studies, and the inconsistencies with the results of cohort studies, limit the interpretability of the RR estimates. The studies also indicated the occurrence of several side effects associated with high intakes of green tea. In addition, the majority of included studies were carried out in Asian populations characterised by a high intake of green tea, thus limiting the generalisability of the findings to other populations. Well conducted and adequately powered RCTs would be needed to draw conclusions on the possible beneficial effects of green tea consumption on cancer risk.","There is a high consumption worldwide of green tea (Camellia sinensis), that contains polyphenols which have a powerful antioxidant activity that can prevent the formation of free radicals that may cause damage and cell death. Therefore it has been suggested that green tea might reduce cancer risk, a theory that has been tested through a number of studies on human populations, which examined the link between green tea consumption and cancer. We assessed the association between green tea consumption and the risk of developing cancer in epidemiologic studies. In this review we included 142 studies with more than 1.1 million participants looking for an association between green tea consumption and cancers of the digestive tract and the female reproductive system, breast, prostate, kidney and urinary tract, nasopharynx, lung, blood, skin, thyroid and brain. The majority of the studies were of medium to high quality in terms of how they were conducted. Overall, the evidence from the studies showed that the consumption of green tea to reduce the risk of cancer was inconsistent. Some studies suggested a beneficial effect on cancer risk, while others indicated no effect, and even suggested a slightly increased cancer risk. In particular, results from experimental studies suggested that green tea extract supplementation yielded a decreased risk for prostate cancer, but increased risk for gynaecological cancers. For non-melanoma skin cancer no difference in cancer cases emerged. Green tea supplementation seemed to slightly improve quality of life compared with placebo, although it was associated with some adverse effects including gastrointestinal disorders, higher levels of liver enzymes, and, more rarely, insomnia, raised blood pressure and skin reactions. In nonexperimental studies, comparing people consuming the highest amount of green tea to those in the lowest category of consumption, we found an indication of a lower occurrence of new cases of overall types of cancer, while no difference emerged for lethal cases. However, results according to the type of cancer and study design were inconsistent. A beneficial effect of green tea consumption on cancer prevention remains unproven so far. Caution is advised regarding supplementation with high-dose green tea extracts due to the possible adverse effects.",1028,"green tea consumption, cancer risk, epidemiological studies, randomised controlled trials, methodological quality, adverse effects, observational studies, summary risk ratio, cohort studies, case-control studies",What was the primary focus of this review and what outcomes were being assessed regarding green tea consumption?,What types of studies were included in the review to investigate the association between green tea consumption and cancer risk?,"What were the key findings regarding the relationship between green tea consumption and various types of cancer, as well as any reported side effects?"
langcao2@illinois.edu,interactive_4,Does yoga relieve cancer-related fatigue in people with cancer?,"Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is one of the most prevalent symptoms in individuals with cancer. Various types of exercise have shown beneficial effects. While previous systematic reviews suggest exercise may improve CRF and quality of life, evidence specifically about yoga's impact, as well as evidence on long-term effects, is limited. Previous syntheses offer promising but inconclusive findings on yoga’s effectiveness. This review is one of a suite of five reviews exploring exercise for cancer-related fatigue.
To assess the effects of yoga versus no yoga on cancer-related fatigue in people with cancer: • before, during, and after anticancer treatment;• in the short, medium, and long term;• and effects on quality of life (QoL), adverse events, depression, and anxiety.
We used CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, five other databases and two trials registers, together with reference checking, citation searching and contact with study authors to identify studies that are included in the review. The latest search date was October 2023.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing yoga to no yoga. We included studies in adults (aged 18 and older) with any type of cancer and anticancer therapy who received yoga before, during, or after anticancer therapy. We included trials evaluating at least one of the main outcomes (CRF or QoL). Yoga had to last for at least five sessions, and involve face-to-face instruction. We excluded trials with fewer than 20 participants randomised per group.
The outcomes of interest in this review are cancer-related fatigue (CRF), quality of life (QoL), adverse events, depression, and anxiety. We used standard methods expected by Cochrane. For analyses, we pooled results within the same period of outcome assessment (i.e. short, medium, and long term), and employed a random-effects model. We assessed risk of bias with the Cochrane risk of bias (RoB) 1 tool, and used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence.
We included 21 RCTs with 2041 people with cancer who received yoga during (13 studies) or after (eight studies) anticancer therapy; none examined yoga initiated before therapy. Here we present results on CRF and QoL; findings on adverse events, depression, and anxiety are in the full review. Yoga during anticancer therapy The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of yoga compared to no yoga on: short-term CRF (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.18 to 0.32; mean difference (MD) on Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI; lower values mean better outcome) of 0.16, 95% CI -0.41 to 0.71; 3 studies, 253 participants); medium-term CRF (MD on Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI; lower values mean better outcome) of -1.30, 95% CI -3.50 to 0.90; 1 study, 67 participants); and long-term CRF (MD 0.09 on BFI, 95% CI 1.16 to 0.98; 2 studies, 155 participants) (all very low-certainty evidence). Yoga may have a small beneficial effect or no effect compared to no yoga on short-term QoL (SMD 0.25, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.45; MD on Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30 (QLQ-C30; higher values mean better outcome) of 5.28, 95% CI 0.84 to 9.56; 4 studies, 374 participants) and medium-term QoL (MD on QLQ-C30 of 7.63, 95% CI 6.71 to 21.97; 2 studies, 151 participants), but the evidence is very uncertain (all very low-certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported long-term QoL. Yoga after anticancer therapy Yoga probably has a beneficial effect compared to no yoga on short-term CRF (SMD -0.26, 95% CI -0.42 to -0.09; MD 2.55, 95% CI 0.88 to 4.12; higher values mean better outcome; 5 studies, 602 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Yoga might have a beneficial effect or no effect compared to no yoga on medium-term CRF, but the evidence is very uncertain (MD 3.02, 95% CI -1.48 to 7.52; 1 study, 54 participants (higher values mean better outcome; very low-certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported long-term CRF. Yoga may have a small beneficial effect or no effect compared to no yoga on short-term QoL (SMD 0.19, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.47; MD -3.27, 95% CI -8.08 to 1.55; higher values mean better outcome; 4 studies, 275 participants) and medium term QoL (MD 7.06, 95% CI -1.38 to 15.50; 1 study, 54 participants; higher values mean better outcome), but the evidence is very uncertain (all very low-certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported long-term QoL. A key limitation of the review was the included studies' methodological constraints: participants' awareness of treatment assignments (yoga or control) potentially introduced bias. Additionally, sample sizes were too small to determine medium- and long-term effects conclusively. Further research is needed to evaluate the sustainability of yoga's impact on cancer-related fatigue, quality of life, and adverse events.
Our review provides uncertain evidence of the beneficial effects of yoga initiated during or after anticancer therapy compared to no yoga for people with cancer. Although there are indications supporting the use of yoga to address CRF, the uncertainty of the evidence underscores the need for caution in its implementation. Future RCTs should employ rigorous methodologies, enrol sufficient participants, and use appropriate controls.","Cancer-related fatigue is a feeling of extreme tiredness that lasts for a long time. It can be caused by cancer, cancer therapy, or both. Cancer-related fatigue affects the body and mood and makes it hard to perform regular activities. It is stronger than just being tired and does not go away by resting. Clinical guidelines recommend physical exercise to improve cancer-related fatigue. Physical exercise affects cancer-related fatigue by influencing biological and psychological processes, but it is unclear what types of exercise may be most beneficial. Yoga may reduce cancer-related fatigue and improve quality of life because it combines physical movement with breath control, mental focus, and body awareness. This review explored whether yoga improves cancer-related fatigue and quality of life in adults. We also examined whether any adverse events occurred in the studies. We investigated short-term (up to 12 weeks), medium-term (12 weeks to 6 months), and long-term (more than 6 months) effects. We searched for studies comparing yoga with no yoga in adults with any cancer, including yoga done before, during, or after anticancer therapy. Multiple types of yoga were included, such as Hatha and Dru yoga. We compared and summarised the results, assessed study quality, and considered differences based on type of yoga, cancer type, format of exercise (group vs individual; supervised vs unsupervised), and participant age. We found 21 studies involving 2041 participants with various cancers, mostly women with breast cancer. Yoga was initiated during anticancer therapy in 13 studies and after therapy in eight studies; no studies examined yoga before treatment. It is unclear whether yoga during anticancer therapy improves short-, medium-, or long-term cancer-related fatigue. Yoga during therapy may increase short- and medium-term quality of life, but the evidence is very uncertain, and no studies measured long-term quality of life. Only one study reported adverse events, so it is unclear whether yoga affects safety outcomes. No meaningful differences were found between different yoga types, training formats, supervision levels, or cancer types. Yoga after anticancer therapy probably reduces short-term cancer-related fatigue, but its effects on medium-term fatigue are unclear, and long-term fatigue was not measured. Yoga after therapy may slightly increase short- and medium-term quality of life, but evidence is very uncertain, and long-term outcomes were not assessed. It is also unclear whether yoga after therapy leads to adverse events, and no differences were found between yoga types, cancer types, or age groups. Limitations include lack of blinding, which may influence results, and small or insufficiently long studies for several outcomes. More research is needed to determine how sustainable the effects of yoga are on cancer-related fatigue, quality of life, and adverse events.",1014,"Cancer-related fatigue (CRF), quality of life (QoL), randomised controlled trials (RCTs), anticancer therapy, standardised mean difference (SMD), confidence interval (CI), Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI), Cochrane risk of bias (RoB), GRADE.",What was the study trying to examine in terms of yoga's impact on cancer-related fatigue?,What methods were used to identify and include studies in the review?,What were the results found regarding yoga's effect on short-term cancer-related fatigue (CRF) after anticancer therapy?
langcao2@illinois.edu,interactive_4,Drugs for preventing lung cancer in healthy people,"This is the second update of this Cochrane Review. Some studies have suggested a protective effect of antioxidant nutrients and higher dietary levels of fruits and vegetables on lung cancer. To determine whether vitamins and minerals and other potential agents, alone or in combination, reduce lung cancer incidence and lung cancer mortality in healthy populations. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase from 1974 to May 2019 and screened references included in published studies and reviews. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing vitamins or mineral supplements with placebo, administered to healthy people with the aim of preventing lung cancer. Four review authors independently selected the trials to be included in the review, assessed their methodological quality and extracted data. For dichotomous outcomes we calculated risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and pooled results using the random-effects model. We assessed the risk of bias using Cochrane's 'Risk of bias' assessment tool and certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. In this update, we identified three new trials for a total of 12 studies. Six analysed vitamin A, three vitamin C, three combined vitamin D3 + calcium, four vitamin E combined with other products, one selenium supplements and nine studied combinations of two or more products. Four studies included only men and five only women. Vitamin A results in little to no difference in lung cancer incidence (RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.19; 5 RCTs, 212314 participants; high-certainty evidence) and lung cancer mortality (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.38; 3 RCTs, 190118 participants; high-certainty evidence). But in smokers or asbestos workers vitamin A increases the risk of lung cancer incidence (RR 1.10, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.20; 3 RCTs, 43995 participants; high-certainty evidence), lung cancer mortality (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.38; 2 RCTs, 29426 participants; high-certainty evidence) and all-cause mortality (RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.13; 2 RCTs, 32883 participants; high-certainty evidence). Vitamin A increases the risk of minor side effects, such as yellowing of the skin and minor gastrointestinal symptoms (high-certainty evidence). Vitamin C likely results in little to no difference in lung cancer incidence (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.49; 2 RCTs, 14953 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). In women, vitamin C increases the risk of lung cancer incidence (RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.95; 1 RCT, 7627 participants; high-certainty evidence). In men, vitamin C results in little to no difference in mortality for lung cancer (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.23; 1 RCT, 7326 participants; high-certainty evidence). Vitamin D + calcium may result in little to no difference in lung cancer incidence in postmenopausal women (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.39 to 2.08; 3 RCTs, 37601 women; low-certainty evidence). Vitamin E results in little to no difference in lung cancer incidence (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.14; 3 RCTs, 36841 participants; high-certainty evidence) or to lung cancer mortality (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.18; 2 RCTs, 29214 participants; high-certainty evidence), but increases the risk of haemorrhagic strokes (hazard ratio (HR), 1.74, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.91; 1 RCT, 14641 participants; high-certainty evidence). Calcium results in little to no difference in lung cancer incidence in postmenopausal women (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.13 to 3.18; 1 RCT, 733 participants) or in risk of renal calculi (RR 1.94, 95% CI 0.20 to 18.57; 1 RCT, 733 participants; low-certainty evidence). Selenium in men results in little to no difference in lung cancer incidence (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.54; 1 RCT, 17448 participants; high-certainty evidence) and lung cancer mortality (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.66; 1 RCT, 17448 participants; high-certainty evidence) and increases the risk for grade 1 to 2 dermatitis (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.31; 1 RCT, 17448 participants; high-certainty evidence) and for alopecia (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.53; 1 RCT, 17448 participants; high-certainty evidence). The combination of vitamins A, C, E + selenium + zinc results in little to no difference in lung cancer incidence (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.48; 1 RCT, 12741 participants; high-certainty evidence). Well-designed RCTs have shown no beneficial effect of supplements for the prevention of lung cancer and lung cancer mortality in healthy people. Vitamin A supplements increase lung cancer incidence and mortality in smokers or persons exposed to asbestos. Vitamin C increases lung cancer incidence in women. Vitamin E increases the risk of haemorrhagic strokes.","We reviewed the evidence assessing the relationship between vitamins or antioxidant intake and lung cancer prevention, mortality and adverse events for that cancer. This review updates our Cochrane Review on this topic published in 2012. Lung cancer is among the leading causes of cancer death throughout the world, and its prevention has become a public health priority. It has been suggested that vitamin supplements and some antioxidants may prevent lung cancer. This review includes 12 studies in which healthy adults were randomly assigned to receive vitamin supplements or placebo (a substance that has no physical effects) and were followed over time to evaluate their risk of developing lung cancer. The evidence is current to May 2019. None of the treatments compared with placebo have shown a difference in the risk for lung cancer incidence or lung cancer mortality in healthy people. In smokers and people exposed to asbestos, vitamin A increases lung cancer incidence, lung cancer mortality and all-cause mortality. Vitamin C increases lung cancer incidence in women. Vitamin E increases the risk of haemorrhagic strokes. The certainty of the evidence is high for the following comparisons against placebo: vitamin A; vitamin E; selenium; and combinations of vitamins A, C, E, selenium and zinc.",1029,"randomised controlled trials, lung cancer incidence, lung cancer mortality, vitamin A, lung cancer, smokers or asbestos workers, confidence intervals, risk ratio, vitamin C, vitamin E",What was the primary aim of the study in the Cochrane Review update?,What research methods were employed in the study to compare vitamin and mineral supplements against placebo?,What were the key findings regarding the impact of vitamin A on lung cancer incidence and mortality in smokers or persons exposed to asbestos?
langcao2@illinois.edu,finetuned_5,Do social support interventions help people with heart disease?,"Globally, cardiovascular diseases (CVD, that is, coronary heart (CHD) and circulatory diseases combined) contribute to 31% of all deaths, more than any other cause. In line with guidance in the UK and globally, cardiac rehabilitation programmes are widely offered to people with heart disease, and include psychosocial, educational, health behaviour change, and risk management components. Social support and social network interventions have potential to improve outcomes of these programmes, but whether and how these interventions work is poorly understood.
To assess the effectiveness of social network and social support interventions to support cardiac rehabilitation and secondary prevention in the management of people with heart disease. The comparator was usual care with no element of social support (i.e. secondary prevention alone or with cardiac rehabilitation).
We undertook a systematic search of the following databases on 9 August 2022: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and the Web of Science. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP. We reviewed the reference lists of relevant systematic reviews and included primary studies, and we contacted experts to identify additional studies.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of social network or social support interventions for people with heart disease. We included studies regardless of their duration of follow-up, and included those reported as full text, published as abstract only, and unpublished data.
Using Covidence, two review authors independently screened all identified titles. We retrieved full-text study reports and publications marked ‘included’, and two review authors independently screened these, and conducted data extraction. Two authors independently assessed risk of bias, and assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular-related mortality, all-cause hospital admission, cardiovascular-related hospital admission, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) measured at > 12 months follow-up.
We included 54 RCTs (126 publications) reporting data for a total of 11,445 people with heart disease. The median follow-up was seven months and median sample size was 96 participants. Of included study participants, 6414 (56%) were male, and the mean age ranged from 48.6 to 76.3 years. Studies included heart failure (41%), mixed cardiac disease (31%), post-myocardial infarction (13%), post-revascularisation (7%), CHD (7%), and cardiac X syndrome (1%) patients. The median intervention duration was 12 weeks. We identified notable diversity in social network and social support interventions, across what was delivered, how, and by whom. We assessed risk of bias (RoB) in primary outcomes at > 12 months follow-up as either 'low' (2/15 studies), 'some concerns' (11/15), or 'high' (2/15). 'Some concerns' or 'high' RoB resulted from insufficient detail on blinding of outcome assessors, data missingness, and absence of pre-agreed statistical analysis plans. In particular, HRQoL outcomes were at high RoB. Using the GRADE method, we assessed the certainty of evidence as low or very low across outcomes. Social network or social support interventions had no clear effect on all-cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to 1.13, I2= 40%) or cardiovascular-related mortality (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.10, I2= 0%) at > 12 months follow-up. The evidence suggests that social network or social support interventions for heart disease may result in little to no difference in all-cause hospital admission (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.22, I2= 0%), or cardiovascular-related hospital admission (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.10, I2= 16%), with a low level of certainty. The evidence was very uncertain regarding the impact of social network interventions on HRQoL at > 12 months follow-up (SF-36 physical component score: mean difference (MD) 31.53, 95% CI -28.65 to 91.71, I2= 100%, 2 trials/comparisons, 166 participants; mental component score MD 30.62, 95% CI -33.88 to 95.13, I2= 100%, 2 trials/comparisons, 166 participants). Regarding secondary outcomes, there may be a decrease in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure with social network or social support interventions. There was no evidence of impact found on psychological well-being, smoking, cholesterol, myocardial infarction, revascularisation, return to work/education, social isolation or connectedness, patient satisfaction, or adverse events. Results of meta-regression did not suggest that the intervention effect was related to risk of bias, intervention type, duration, setting, and delivery mode, population type, study location, participant age, or percentage of male participants.
We found no strong evidence for the effectiveness of such interventions, although modest effects were identified in relation to blood pressure. While the data presented in this review are indicative of potential for positive effects, the review also highlights the lack of sufficient evidence to conclusively support such interventions for people with heart disease. Further high-quality, well-reported RCTs are required to fully explore the potential of social support interventions in this context. Future reporting of social network and social support interventions for people with heart disease needs to be significantly clearer, and more effectively theorised, in order to ascertain causal pathways and effect on outcomes.","The term 'heart disease' refers to a range of disorders affecting the heart, including: coronary heart disease (disease of the heart blood vessels); heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation); heart infections; and congenital heart defects. Common symptoms of heart disease are chest pain (angina) and heart attack (myocardial infarction). Heart disease is a common cause of early death worldwide. Modern cardiac rehabilitation programmes are typically designed to address physical, mental, and social factors, and so to support people with heart disease in their day-to-day life.
There is some evidence to suggest that low levels of social support and social isolation are linked to poor health for people with heart disease. Social network or social support interventions intentionally use social relationships to support healthy behaviours, and may involve partners, family members, friends, other peers, or caregivers. While some research suggests such programmes might contribute to improving health in people with heart disease, there has to date been no systematic review of the evidence.
We wanted to find out whether programmes designed to help people with heart disease, which include a clearly described component of social support, might improve:
- deaths (from heart disease, or any other cause);
- hospital admissions;
- health-related quality of life.
We also wanted to find out if they improved any other related factors, such as mental health and well-being, and social isolation.
We searched databases for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of social network or social support interventions for people with heart disease.
We compared and summarised the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.
We found 54 eligible studies involving 11,445 people with heart disease. We found wide variation in the kinds of interventions included in the review, in terms of what the programmes included, how and by whom they were delivered, and the clarity with which they were reported.
Most participants were male, with an average age ranging from 49 to 76 years. Studies included people with heart failure, post-myocardial infarction (heart attack), mixed heart disease, and post-revascularisation (procedures to widen blocked or narrowed arteries).
We found that social network or social support interventions had no clear effect on deaths, hospital admissions, or health-related quality of life.
The reporting of factors such as what programmes included, how they were delivered, and how they were tested was highly variable. This made it hard to assess the evidence presented.

langcao2@illinois.edu,finetuned_5,Bisphosphonates and denosumab for breast cancer,"Bone is the most common site of metastatic disease associated with breast cancer (BC). Bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, and novel targeted therapies such as denosumab inhibit other key bone metabolism pathways. We have studied these agents in both early breast cancer and advanced breast cancer settings. This is an update of the review originally published in 2002 and subsequently updated in 2005 and 2012.
To assess the effects of bisphosphonates and other bone agents in addition to anti-cancer treatment: (i) in women with early breast cancer (EBC); (ii) in women with advanced breast cancer without bone metastases (ABC); and (iii) in women with metastatic breast cancer and bone metastases (BCBM).
In this review update, we searched Cochrane Breast Cancer's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov on 19 September 2016.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing: (a) one treatment with a bisphosphonate/bone-acting agent with the same treatment without a bisphosphonate/bone-acting agent; (b) treatment with one bisphosphonate versus treatment with a different bisphosphonate; (c) treatment with a bisphosphonate versus another bone-acting agent of a different mechanism of action (e.g. denosumab); and (d) immediate treatment with a bisphosphonate/bone-acting agent versus delayed treatment of the same bisphosphonate/bone-acting agent.
Two review authors independently extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and quality of the evidence. The primary outcome measure was bone metastases for EBC and ABC, and a skeletal-related event (SRE) for BCBM. We derived risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and the meta-analyses used random-effects models. Secondary outcomes included overall survival and disease-free survival for EBC; we derived hazard ratios (HRs) for these time-to-event outcomes where possible. We collected toxicity and quality-of-life information. GRADE was used to assess the quality of evidence for the most important outcomes in each treatment setting.
We included 44 RCTs involving 37,302 women. In women with EBC, bisphosphonates were associated with a reduced risk of bone metastases compared to placebo/no bisphosphonate (RR 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75 to 0.99; P = 0.03, 11 studies; 15,005 women; moderate-quality evidence with no significant heterogeneity). Bisphosphonates provided an overall survival benefit with time-to-event data (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.99; P = 0.04; 9 studies; 13,949 women; high-quality evidence with evidence of heterogeneity). Subgroup analysis by menopausal status showed a survival benefit from bisphosphonates in postmenopausal women (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.90; P = 0.001; 4 studies; 6048 women; high-quality evidence with no evidence of heterogeneity) but no survival benefit for premenopausal women (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.22; P = 0.78; 2 studies; 3501 women; high-quality evidence with no heterogeneity). There was evidence of no effect of bisphosphonates on disease-free survival (HR 0.94, 95% 0.87 to 1.02; P = 0.13; 7 studies; 12,578 women; high-quality evidence with significant heterogeneity present) however subgroup analyses showed a disease-free survival benefit from bisphosphonates in postmenopausal women only (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.91; P < 0.001; 7 studies; 8314 women; high-quality evidence with no heterogeneity). Bisphosphonates did not significantly reduce the incidence of fractures when compared to placebo/no bisphosphonates (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.08, P = 0.13, 6 studies, 7602 women; moderate-quality evidence due to wide confidence intervals). We await mature overall survival and disease-free survival results for denosumab trials. In women with ABC without clinically evident bone metastases, there was no evidence of an effect of bisphosphonates on bone metastases (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.43; P = 0.86; 3 studies; 330 women; moderate-quality evidence with no heterogeneity) or overall survival (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.09; P = 0.28; 3 studies; 330 women; high-quality evidence with no heterogeneity) compared to placebo/no bisphosphonates however the confidence intervals were wide. One study reported a trend towards an extended period of time without a SRE with bisphosphonate compared to placebo (low-quality evidence). One study reported quality of life and there was no apparent difference in scores between bisphosphonate and placebo (moderate-quality evidence). In women with BCBM, bisphosphonates reduced the SRE risk by 14% (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.95; P = 0.003; 9 studies; 2810 women; high-quality evidence with evidence of heterogeneity) compared with placebo/no bisphosphonates. This benefit persisted when administering either intravenous or oral bisphosphonates versus placebo. Bisphosphonates delayed the median time to a SRE with a median ratio of 1.43 (95% CI 1.29 to 1.58; P < 0.00001; 9 studies; 2891 women; high-quality evidence with no heterogeneity) and reduced bone pain (in 6 out of 11 studies; moderate-quality evidence) compared to placebo/no bisphosphonate. Treatment with bisphosphonates did not appear to affect overall survival (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.11; P = 0.85; 7 studies; 1935 women; moderate-quality evidence with significant heterogeneity). Quality-of-life scores were slightly better with bisphosphonates than placebo at comparable time points (in three out of five studies; moderate-quality evidence) however scores decreased during the course of the studies. Denosumab reduced the risk of developing a SRE compared with bisphosphonates by 22% (RR 0.78, 0.72 to 0.85; P < 0.001; 3 studies, 2345 women). One study reported data on overall survival and observed no difference in survival between denosumab and bisphosphonate. Reported toxicities across all settings were generally mild. Osteonecrosis of the jaw was rare, occurring less than 0.5% in the adjuvant setting (high-quality evidence).
For women with EBC, bisphosphonates reduce the risk of bone metastases and provide an overall survival benefit compared to placebo or no bisphosphonates. There is preliminary evidence suggestive that bisphosphonates provide an overall survival and disease-free survival benefit in postmenopausal women only when compared to placebo or no bisphosphonate. This was not a planned subgroup for these early trials, and we await the completion of new large clinical trials assessing benefit for postmenopausal women. For women with BCBM, bisphosphonates reduce the risk of developing SREs, delay the median time to an SRE, and appear to reduce bone pain compared to placebo or no bisphosphonate.","Breast cancer may spread and recur in the bones. This may cause fractures, pain and high calcium in the bloodstream (known as complications).
Medicines for osteoporosis may prevent these complications and may help cure cancer by reducing cancer growth in the bone. These medicines are called 'bisphosphonates'. A newer type is called ‘denosumab’. Bisphosphonates or denosumab are given in addition to other cancer treatment medications. These may be given along with chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, or radiotherapy.
The goal of bisphosphonates and denosumab differs based on the women's breast cancer status.
We asked three main questions:
1. For women with early breast cancer (EBC) , can bisphosphonates or denosumab reduce the risk of the cancer spreading to the bone? Will adding this medicine to anticancer treatments allow women to live longer (improve survival)?
2. For women with advanced breast cancer which does not appear to involve the bone (ABC) , can bisphosphonates reduce the risk of the cancer spreading to the bone and improve survival? Will bisphosphonates reduce complications and improve quality of life?
3. For women with metastatic breast cancer that has spread to the bone (BCBM), can bisphosphonates or denosumab reduce the risk of complication, and improve quality of life and survival?
We found 44 studies involving 37,302 participants. We included studies published by September 2016.
For women with EBC, we included 17 studies with 26,129 participants. The women’s health was monitored for at least 12 months from the start of the study. Some studies monitored women for 10 years.
The studies tested different types of bisphosphonate drugs and denosumab, and different doses of these drugs. Some studies compared the drugs to no treatment. Some studies used oral medications. Other studies gave the medicine as an injection into a vein or under the skin.
Bisphosphonates probably lowered the risk of cancer spreading to the bone.
Bisphosphonates were found to improve survival, but the benefit in the whole group of women was small. Postmenopausal women had a benefit from bisphosphonates with improved survival and reduced risk of cancer returning. Premenopausal women did not have improved survival or reduced risk of the cancer returning. New studies that test bisphosphonates by the women's menopausal status are awaited.
We await the reporting of data on survival and other important outcomes from denosumab trials.
For women with ABC that had not spread to the bone, we included three studies enrolling 330 participants. All three studies compared oral bisphosphonates to no treatment.
Bisphosphonates did not reduce the risk of cancer spreading to the bone or improve survival. Very little information was available on complications and quality of life from only one study.
For women with BCBM, we included 24 studies enrolling 10,853 participants. Their health was monitored for at least 12 months. Some women were followed for 24 months. Most studies compared bisphosphonates to receiving no medication.
Bisphosphonates reduced complications (fractures and bone pain). Bisphosphonates did not appear to increase the length of time women survived. Quality of life scores were slightly better for women receiving bisphosphonates compared to similar women having no bisphosphonates.
Denosumab reduced the risk of complications compared to bisphosphonates in the three studies that collected these data. There was no benefit in survival from denosumab in the one study that collected data.
Side effects were uncommon and mild. There was a rare risk of damage to the jaw bone (“osteonecrosis of the jaw”).
Overall, most of the evidence was moderate to high-quality. This means that we are fairly confident in the findings.",1019,"bone metastases, bisphosphonates, skeletal-related event (SRE), advanced breast cancer (ABC), early breast cancer (EBC), postmenopausal women, disease-free survival, denosumab, randomised controlled trials (RCTs), overall survival",What were the specific effects being assessed of bisphosphonates and other bone agents on women with different stages of breast cancer?,What methodologies were employed by the researchers to gather and assess data in the study?,What were the key findings regarding the impact of bisphosphonates on survival and metastases risk in women with early breast cancer compared to placebo?
langcao2@illinois.edu,finetuned_5,Medicines to prevent breast cancer in women at above-average risk of developing breast cancer,"Breast cancer is the most frequently occurring malignancy and the second cause of death for cancer in women. Cancer prevention agents (CPAs) are a promising approach to reduce the burden of breast cancer. Currently, two main types of CPAs are available: selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs, such as tamoxifen and raloxifene) and aromatase inhibitors (AIs, such as exemestane and anastrozole).
To assess the efficacy and acceptability of single CPAs for the prevention of primary breast cancer, in unaffected women, at an above-average risk of developing breast cancer. Using a network meta-analysis, to rank single CPAs, based on their efficacy and acceptability (an endpoint that is defined as the inverse of CPA-related toxicity).
We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), and ClinicalTrials.gov on 17 August 2018. We handsearched reference lists to identify additional relevant studies.
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that enrolled women without a personal history of breast cancer but with an above-average risk of developing a tumor. Women had to be treated with a CPA and followed up to record the occurrence of breast cancer and adverse events.
Two review authors independently extracted data and conducted risk of bias assessments of the included studies, and assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. Outcome data included incidence of breast carcinoma (both invasive and in situ carcinoma) and adverse events (both overall and severe toxicity). We performed a conventional meta-analysis (for direct comparisons of a single CPA with placebo or a different CPA) and network meta-analysis (for indirect comparisons).
We included six studies enrolling 50,927 women randomized to receive one CPA (SERMs: tamoxifen or raloxifene, or AIs: exemestane or anastrozole) or placebo. Three studies compared tamoxifen and placebo, two studies compared AIs (exemestane or anastrozole) versus placebo, and one study compared tamoxifen versus raloxifene. The risk of bias was low for all RCTs. For the tamoxifen versus placebo comparison, tamoxifen likely resulted in a lower risk of developing breast cancer compared to placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 0.76; 3 studies, 22,832 women; moderate-certainty evidence). In terms of adverse events, tamoxifen likely increased the risk of severe toxicity compared to placebo (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.47; 2 studies, 20,361 women; moderate-certainty evidence). In particular, women randomized to receive tamoxifen experienced a higher incidence of both endometrial carcinoma (RR 2.26, 95% CI 1.52 to 3.38; high-certainty evidence) and thromboembolism (RR 2.10, 95% CI 1.14 to 3.89; high-certainty evidence) compared to women who received placebo. For the AIs versus placebo comparison, AIs (exemestane or anastrozole) reduced the risk of breast cancer by 53% (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.63; 2 studies, 8424 women; high-certainty evidence). In terms of adverse events, AIs increased the risk of severe toxicity by 18% (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.28; 2 studies, 8352 women; high-certainty evidence). These differences were sustained especially by endocrine (e.g. hot flashes), gastrointestinal (e.g. diarrhea), and musculoskeletal (e.g. arthralgia) adverse events, while there were no differences in endometrial cancer or thromboembolism rates between AIs and placebo. For the tamoxifen versus raloxifene comparison, raloxifene probably performed worse than tamoxifen in terms of breast cancer incidence reduction (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.43; 1 study, 19,490 women; moderate-certainty evidence), but its use was associated with lower toxicity rates (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.95; 1 study, 19,490 women; moderate-certainty evidence), particularly relating to incidence of endometrial cancer and thromboembolism. An indirect comparison of treatment effects allowed us to compare the SERMs and AIs in this review. In terms of efficacy, AIs (exemestane or anastrozole) may have reduced breast cancer incidence slightly compared to tamoxifen (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.98; 5 RCTs, 31,256 women); however, the certainty of evidence was low. A lack of model convergence did not allow us to analyze toxicity data.
For women with an above-average risk of developing breast cancer, CPAs can reduce the incidence of this disease. AIs appear to be more effective than SERMs (tamoxifen) in reducing the risk of developing breast cancer. AIs are not associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer and thromboembolic events. However, long-term data on toxicities from tamoxifen are available while the follow-up toxicity data on unaffected women taking AIs is relatively short. Additional data from direct comparisons are needed to fully address the issues of breast cancer prevention by risk-reducing medications, with special regards to acceptability (i.e. the benefit/harm ratio).","Breast cancer is the most frequent type of cancer and the second cause of death by cancer in women. Therefore, any strategy which can reduce its burden is eagerly awaited. Cancer prevention agents (CPAs) are medicines that might fulfil this need. Currently, two main types of CPAs are available to combat breast cancer: selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs, such as tamoxifen and raloxifene) and aromatase inhibitors (such as exemestane and anastrozole). Women without personal history of breast cancer, but with above-average risk of developing this disease (that is, with a lifetime risk greater than 17%) represent the usual target population for CPAs.
This Cochrane Review aimed to summarize the evidence on the efficacy and toxicity of CPAs for the prevention of primary breast cancer.
The review authors found six studies enrolling 50,927 women to receive one CPA or placebo (a pretend treatment, e.g. a sugar pill). Three studies involving 23,013 women compared tamoxifen and placebo, two studies involving 8424 women compared aromatase inhibitors (exemestane or anastrozole) and placebo, and one study involving 19,490 women that compared tamoxifen and raloxifene.
Based on the three studies that compared tamoxifen to placebo, tamoxifen probably reduced the risk of developing breast cancer by 32% compared to placebo. However, tamoxifen was associated with a 28% increased risk of severe side effects compared to placebo based on two studies involving 20,361 women. In particular, women taking tamoxifen experienced higher incidence of endometrial cancer and thromboembolism than women having no medicine.
For women who received either an aromatase inhibitor (exemestane or anastrozole) or placebo, aromatase inhibitors reduced the risk of breast cancer by 53% compared to placebo. Data from two studies involving 8352 women indicated that aromatase inhibitors increased the risk of severe side effects by 18% compared to placebo. These differences were sustained especially by endocrine (hormonal; e.g. hot flashes), gastrointestinal (e.g. diarrhea), and musculoskeletal (e.g. joint pain) side effects, whereas there were no differences in either endometrial cancer or thromboembolism rates.
For women who received either tamoxifen or raloxifene, raloxifene probably performed worse than tamoxifen in terms of breast cancer incidence reduction, but its use was associated with a 13% reduction of toxicity rates especially endometrial cancer and thromboembolism.
A specialized method named a 'network meta-analysis' allowed us to compare medications never directly compared to each other in a study. Based on this network meta-analysis, aromatase inhibitors may have led to a 23% additional risk reduction of developing breast cancer compared to tamoxifen. However, the reliability of the evidence was low meaning that further research is likely to have an impact on our confidence in this result. This analysis could not be performed on toxicity data.

langcao2@illinois.edu,finetuned_6,Which exercise is better for reducing fatigue caused by cancer: cardiovascular or resistance training?,"With prevalence estimates between 50% and 90% of people with cancer, cancer-related fatigue is one of the most common morbidities related to cancer and its treatment. Exercise is beneficial for the treatment of cancer-related fatigue. However, the efficacy of different types of exercise (i.e. cardiovascular training and resistance training) have not yet been investigated systematically and compared directly in a meta-analysis.
To compare the benefits and harms of cardiovascular training versus resistance training for treatment or prevention of cancer-related fatigue in people with cancer.
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and five other databases in January 2023. We searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials. We integrated results from update searches of previously published Cochrane reviews. In total, our searches included trials from inception to October 2023.
We included randomised controlled trials investigating cardiovascular training compared with resistance training, with exercise as the main component. We included studies on adults with cancer (aged 18 years and older), with or without a diagnosis of cancer-related fatigue, for any type of cancer and any type of cancer treatment, with the intervention starting before, during, or after treatment. We included trials evaluating at least one of our primary outcomes (cancer-related fatigue or quality of life). We excluded combined cardiovascular and resistance interventions, yoga, and mindfulness-based interventions. Our primary outcomes were cancer-related fatigue and quality of life. Our secondary outcomes were adverse events, anxiety, and depression.
We used standard Cochrane methodology. For analyses, we pooled results within the same period of outcome assessment (i.e. short term (up to and including 12 weeks' follow-up), medium term (more than 12 weeks' to less than six months' follow-up), and long term (six months' follow-up or longer)). We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane RoB 1 tool, and certainty of the evidence using GRADE.
We included six studies with 447 participants with prostate, breast, or lung cancer who received radiotherapy or chemotherapy, had surgery, or a combination of these. All studies had a high risk of bias due to lack of blinding. Three studies had an additional high risk of bias domain; one study for attrition bias, and two studies for selection bias. Interventions in the cardiovascular training groups included training on a cycle ergometer, treadmill, an elliptical trainer, or indoor bike. Interventions in the resistance training group included a varying number of exercises using bodyweight, weights, or resistance bands. Interventions varied in frequency, intensity, and duration. None of the included studies reported including participants with a confirmed cancer-related fatigue diagnosis. The interventions in four studies started during cancer treatment and in two studies after cancer treatment. Before treatment No studies reported interventions starting before cancer treatment. During treatment The evidence was very uncertain about the effect of cardiovascular training compared with resistance training for short-term cancer-related fatigue (mean difference (MD) −0.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) −2.52 to 1.84; 4 studies, 311 participants; Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy – Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue) scale where higher values indicate better outcome; very low-certainty evidence) and long-term cancer-related fatigue (MD 1.30, 95% CI −2.17 to 4.77; 1 study, 141 participants; FACIT-Fatigue scale; very low-certainty evidence). The evidence was very uncertain about the effect of cardiovascular training compared with resistance training for short-term quality of life (MD 1.47, 95% CI −1.47 to 4.42; 4 studies, 319 participants; Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy – General scale where higher values indicate better outcome; very low-certainty evidence) and for long-term quality of life (MD 3.40, 95% CI −4.85 to 11.65; 1 study, 141 participants; Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy – Anemia scale where higher values indicate better outcome; very low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of cardiovascular training compared with resistance training on the occurrence of adverse events at any follow-up (risk ratio (RR) 2.00, 95% CI 0.19 to 21.18; 2 studies, 128 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No studies reported medium-term cancer-related fatigue or quality of life. After treatment The evidence was very uncertain about the effect of cardiovascular training compared with resistance training for short-term cancer-related fatigue (MD 1.47, 95% CI −0.09 to 3.03; 1 study, 95 participants; Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory-20 General Fatigue subscale where higher values indicate worse outcome; very low-certainty evidence). Resistance training may improve short-term quality of life compared to cardiovascular training, but the evidence is very uncertain (MD −10.96, 95% CI −17.77 to −4.15; 1 study, 95 participants; European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30 Global Health subscale where higher values indicate better outcome; very low-certainty evidence). No studies reported outcomes at medium-term or long-term follow-up.
The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of cardiovascular training compared with resistance training on treatment of cancer-related fatigue in people with cancer. Larger, well-conducted studies including people with different cancer types receiving different treatments are needed to increase the certainty in the evidence and to better understand who may benefit most from cardiovascular or resistance training. Moreover, studies comparing the effects of cardiovascular and resistance training initiated before as well as after cancer treatment are needed to understand the prophylactic and rehabilitative effects of these exercise types on cancer-related fatigue.","Fatigue caused by cancer is a feeling of extreme tiredness that lasts for a long time. It is related to cancer or cancer treatment, or both. It affects both the body and feelings, and can make it difficult to do regular activities. Fatigue caused by cancer is a lot worse than regular tiredness, and it does not go away with more sleep or rest.
We wanted to find out if there are differences between cardiovascular training and resistance training for the treatment and prevention of fatigue caused by cancer, well-being (also known as quality of life), and unwanted effects. Cardiovascular training involves exercise such as walking, running, swimming, and cycling, whereas resistance training includes exercise using one's own bodyweight, weights, or elastic therapy bands.
We searched for studies that compared cardiovascular training and resistance training in people with any type of cancer. Training could have been started before, during, or after cancer treatment.
We summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.
We found six studies that involved 447 people with breast cancer, prostate cancer (a small gland in the pelvis that is part of the male reproductive system), or lung cancer. These studies did not report if people already had fatigue caused by cancer before starting to exercise. People in these studies were treated with chemotherapy (medicines to kill the cancer), radiotherapy (radiation directed at the cancer to reduce or kill it), surgery (to remove the cancer), or a combination of these. The cardiovascular or resistance training started during or after cancer treatment. Most studies looked at short-term results (up to and including 12 weeks of monitoring), only one study had long-term results (six months or longer of monitoring). Studies were supported by research grants and took place in Canada, Belgium, the USA, and Germany.
The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of cardiovascular and resistance training on fatigue caused by cancer, well-being, and unwanted effects in the short or long term.
Our confidence in the evidence is very low. We found only a few studies including low numbers of people. We also found problems in the methods of the studies. For example, people in the studies knew which training they received. This could have influenced the results.

langcao2@illinois.edu,finetuned_6,Helicobacter pylori treatment for the prevention of stomach cancer,"Gastric cancer is the third most common cause of cancer death worldwide. Individuals infected with Helicobacter pylori have a higher likelihood of developing gastric cancer than individuals who are not infected. Eradication of H. pylori in healthy asymptomatic individuals in the general population may reduce the incidence of gastric cancer, but the magnitude of this effect is unclear.
To assess the effectiveness of eradication of H. pylori in healthy asymptomatic individuals in the general population in reducing the incidence of gastric cancer.
We identified trials by searching the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2020, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1946 to February 2020), and EMBASE (1974 to February 2020). We handsearched reference lists from trials selected by electronic searching to identify further relevant trials. We handsearched published abstracts from conference proceedings from the United European Gastroenterology Week (published in Gut) and Digestive Disease Week (published in Gastroenterology) between 2001 and 2019. We contacted members of the Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Diseases Review Group and experts in the field and asked them to provide details of outstanding clinical trials and any relevant unpublished materials.
We analysed randomised controlled trials comparing at least one week of H. pylori therapy with placebo or no treatment in preventing subsequent development of gastric cancer in otherwise healthy and asymptomatic H. pylori-positive adults. Trials had to follow up participants for at least two years and needed to have at least two participants with gastric cancer as an outcome. We defined gastric cancer as any gastric adenocarcinoma, including intestinal (differentiated) or diffuse (undifferentiated) type, with or without specified histology.
We collected data on incidence of gastric cancer, incidence of oesophageal cancer, deaths from gastric cancer, deaths from any cause, and adverse effects arising due to therapy.
Six trials met all our eligibility criteria and provided extractable data in the previous version. Following our updated search, one new RCT was identified, meaning that seven trials were included in this updated review. In addition, one previously included trial provided fully published data out to 10 years, and another previously included trial provided fully published data out to 22 years of follow-up. Four trials were at low risk of bias, one trial was at unclear risk, and two trials were at high risk of bias. Six trials were conducted in Asian populations. In preventing development of subsequent gastric cancer, H. pylori eradication therapy was superior to placebo or no treatment (RR 0.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 0.72, 7 trials, 8323 participants, moderate certainty evidence). Only two trials reported the effect of eradication of H. pylori on the development of subsequent oesophageal cancer. Sixteen (0.8%) of 1947 participants assigned to eradication therapy subsequently developed oesophageal cancer compared with 13 (0.7%) of 1941 participants allocated to placebo (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.59 to 2.54, moderate certainty evidence). H. pylori eradication reduced mortality from gastric cancer compared with placebo or no treatment (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.92, 4 trials, 6301 participants, moderate certainty evidence). There was little or no evidence in all-cause mortality (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.12, 5 trials, 7079 participants, moderate certainty evidence). Adverse events data were poorly reported.
We found moderate certainty evidence that searching for and eradicating H. pylori reduces the incidence of gastric cancer and death from gastric cancer in healthy asymptomatic infected Asian individuals, but we cannot necessarily extrapolate this data to other populations.","Whether testing healthy people for Helicobacter pylori and treating those infected with a course of antibiotics decreases the number of new cases of gastric cancer. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a bacteria that lives in the lining of the stomach with people usually not aware they are carrying the infection. People with H. pylori infection are more likely to develop gastric cancer than people who are not infected with the bacterium. For this reason, H. pylori is classed as carcinogenic (causing cancer) to humans. Many people worldwide die of gastric cancer every year, because by the time those affected seek the opinion of a doctor, the condition is often advanced. However, H. pylori infection is easily treatable with a one-week course of antibiotics. A literature search up to 02 Feburary 2020 found seven trials (containing 8323 participants, four trials at low risk of bias). Six of the studies were based in Asia. We found that antibiotics for H. pylori have a small benefit in preventing gastric cancer (68 (1.6%) of 4206 participants given treatment developed gastric cancer subsequently, compared with 125 (3.0%) of 4117 given no treatment or a placebo), and in decreasing the number of deaths from gastric cancer (36 (1.1%) of 3154, compared with 59 (1.9%) of 3147); but it is unclear whether or not they increase or decrease the number of deaths due to any cause, or increase or decrease the number of cases of oesophageal cancer. Data about side effects of treatment were poorly reported. Four trials were at low risk of bias, one trial was at unclear risk, and two trials were at high risk of bias. One study was at high risk of bias because no placebo was used for the active eradication therapy regimen, and so this part of the trial was unblinded, and the other study was at high risk of bias due to inconsistencies in data reporting at the two points of follow-up. We were unable to resolve this discrepancy despite contacting the original authors. As a result, we downgraded the quality of evidence from high to moderate due to serious risk of bias.",1030,"Gastric cancer, Helicobacter pylori, H. pylori eradication therapy, Randomised controlled trials, Incidence of gastric cancer, Moderate certainty evidence, Confidence interval, Bias, Oesophageal cancer, Mortality from gastric cancer",What was the main objective or focus of the study regarding Helicobacter pylori?,What methods were employed in this study to assess the effectiveness of H. pylori eradication?,What were the significant findings related to the effect of H. pylori eradication on gastric cancer and mortality in the study?
langcao2@illinois.edu,finetuned_6,"Thymic peptides for treatment of cancer patients in addition to chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or both","Purified thymus extracts (pTE) and synthetic thymic peptides (sTP) are thought to enhance the immune system of cancer patients to help fight tumour growth and reduce infections caused by disease-related or treatment-related immunosuppression. This review evaluated the effectiveness of pTE and sTP for cancer management. Researchers searched major medical databases up to February 2010 for randomized trials in adult cancer patients where pTE or sTP were added to chemotherapy or radiotherapy and compared with the same regimen alone or with placebo. Data were independently extracted by two authors, and odds ratios were calculated for overall survival, disease-free survival, tumour response, and adverse effects. A random-effects model was used. Twenty-six trials involving 2736 patients were identified: 20 trials investigated pTE (thymostimulin or thymosin fraction 5) and six investigated sTP (thymopentin or thymosin ?1). Twenty-one trials reported overall survival, six reported disease-free survival, 14 reported tumour response, nine reported adverse effects, and 10 reported safety. Adding pTE showed no benefit for overall survival (RR 1.00), disease-free survival (RR 0.97), or tumour response (RR 1.07), with moderate to high heterogeneity. For thymosin ?1, the pooled RR for overall survival was 1.21 and for disease-free survival was 3.37, though neither result reached statistical significance. pTE reduced the risk of severe infectious complications (RR 0.54), and thymostimulin showed a non-significant trend toward reduced severe neutropenia. Both pTE and sTP were generally well tolerated. Many trials had at least moderate risk of bias. Overall, there is no clear evidence that adding pTE to cancer treatment improves survival or tumour response, although thymosin ?1 showed a possible trend toward benefit. There is preliminary evidence that pTE may reduce severe infectious complications during chemotherapy or radiotherapy.","The immune system plays a key role in the body�s own defences against cancer cells. The thymus gland plays a central part in this and modifies T-cells, a subset of lymphocytes. Studies with thymic peptides have shown a variety of effects on the immune system. There are two groups of thymic peptides available for use in treatment: purified extracts from animal (mostly calf) thymus glands and synthetically produced thymus gland peptides.
This review aims to answer the question whether having thymic peptides can improve the response to and tolerability of standard chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or combined treatment. Further questions are whether the peptides inhibit or reduce the progression and recurrence of disease, whether they prolong the life of cancer patients and whether quality of life is improved. This review looked at the evidence from 26 clinical trials with a total of 2736 adult cancer patients. Many of the trials were small and of moderate quality. Only three studies were less than 10 years old. Thymosin ?1 is a synthetic peptide that shows some promise as a treatment option for patients with metastatic melanoma when used in addition to chemotherapy. Severe problems occur during chemotherapy and radiotherapy due to low white blood cell counts and infections. These were reduced by using purified thymus extracts. However, the use of purified thymus extracts should be investigated more thoroughly before the extracts are used routinely in patients. The findings were not conclusive and caution is advised. Overall, thymic peptides seem to be well tolerated.",1021,"purified thymus extracts, synthetic thymic peptides, thymosin ?1, overall survival, disease-free survival, tumour response, severe infectious complications, risk of bias, random-effects model, chemotherapy",What was the primary objective of the study in relation to pTE and sTP for cancer management?,"What methods did the study employ to evaluate the effectiveness of pTE and sTP, including the type of trials and the data extraction process?","What were the main findings regarding the impact of pTE and sTP on overall survival, disease-free survival, tumor response, and adverse effects?"
