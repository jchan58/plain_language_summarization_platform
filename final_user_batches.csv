63eda5a4a87d8bd73853fa8e,static_1,Omega-6 fats to prevent and treat heart and circulatory diseases,"Omega-6 fats are essential polyunsaturated fats involved in many normal body functions, but there has long been debate about whether increasing omega-6 intake helps prevent cardiovascular disease. This review assessed whether raising dietary omega-6 fats mainly linoleic acid (LA) and gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) reduces the risk of death, heart disease, or stroke, and whether it affects cholesterol levels, body weight, or other risk factors. We included 19 randomised controlled trials involving 6461 adults from a range of populations, followed for one to eight years. Most trials asked participants to replace saturated or monounsaturated fats with omega-6 fats, and seven used supplemental GLA while twelve increased dietary LA. No studies specifically investigated other omega-6 fats such as DGLA or AA. Only three of the included trials were judged to be at low overall risk of bias.
Across trials, increasing omega-6 intake probably makes little or no difference to the risk of dying from any cause (risk ratio 1.00, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.12) or to the overall risk of cardiovascular events such as heart attacks and strokes (risk ratio 0.97, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.15). Evidence for effects on cardiovascular death, coronary heart disease events, major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events, and stroke was very uncertain due to low trial quality and wide confidence intervals. No clear effect of dose or duration was seen, although there was a hint that people who started with the lowest omega-6 intake may have experienced slightly greater protection.

Increasing omega-6 fats may slightly reduce the risk of myocardial infarction (risk ratio 0.88, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.02), suggesting that roughly 53 people may need to increase their omega-6 intake to prevent one heart attack, although this estimate remains uncertain. High-quality evidence showed that increasing omega-6 intake consistently lowers total cholesterol by a small amount (about 0.33 mmol/L on average), and this effect was stronger at higher doses. However, omega-6 intake appears to have little or no meaningful effect on triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, body weight, or body mass index.

Overall, current evidence does not show that increasing omega-6 fats meaningfully reduces major cardiovascular outcomes, other than a possible small reduction in heart attack risk. Omega-6 intake does modestly lower total cholesterol, but it does not appear to improve other blood fats or reduce body weight. While increasing omega-6 fats may still be helpful for people at higher risk of myocardial infarction, stronger and higher-quality evidence is needed to determine whether omega-6 fats provide meaningful long-term cardiovascular benefits.","We reviewed randomised trials (participants had an equal chance to be assigned to either treatment) examining effects of higher omega-6 fats compared to lower omega-6 fats on deaths and heart and circulatory diseases (cardiovascular diseases (CVD), which include heart attacks and strokes).
Omega-6 fats are essential, we must obtain some from food. They are important for regulating energy production (part of metabolism), bone, skin and hair health. Many foods contain omega-6 fats, particularly vegetable oils and nuts. Omega-6 fats include linoleic acid (LA), gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) and arachidonic acid (AA).
Some evidence suggests that a higher intake of omega-6 fats, along with a lower intake of saturated fat (from animal sources such as meat and cheese) can reduce coronary heart disease. In contrast, there is concern that high levels of omega-6 fats may worsen cardiovascular risk by increasing inflammation. Overall, there is no conclusive evidence on the benefits or harms of omega-6 fat intake on heart and circulatory diseases or on other health outcomes.
Evidence in this review is current to May 2017. We found 19 studies recruiting 6461 adults. These studies assessed the effects of higher compared to lower omega-6 fat intake on heart and circulatory diseases as well as deaths. We found that three trials were highly trustworthy (with good designs that produce reliable evidence). Studies took place in North America, Asia, Europe and Australia, and eight were funded only by national or charitable agencies.

63eda5a4a87d8bd73853fa8e,static_2,Which exercise is better for reducing fatigue caused by cancer: cardiovascular or resistance training?,"With prevalence estimates between 50% and 90% of people with cancer, cancer-related fatigue is one of the most common morbidities related to cancer and its treatment. Exercise is beneficial for the treatment of cancer-related fatigue. However, the efficacy of different types of exercise (i.e. cardiovascular training and resistance training) have not yet been investigated systematically and compared directly in a meta-analysis.
To compare the benefits and harms of cardiovascular training versus resistance training for treatment or prevention of cancer-related fatigue in people with cancer.
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and five other databases in January 2023. We searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials. We integrated results from update searches of previously published Cochrane reviews. In total, our searches included trials from inception to October 2023.
We included randomised controlled trials investigating cardiovascular training compared with resistance training, with exercise as the main component. We included studies on adults with cancer (aged 18 years and older), with or without a diagnosis of cancer-related fatigue, for any type of cancer and any type of cancer treatment, with the intervention starting before, during, or after treatment. We included trials evaluating at least one of our primary outcomes (cancer-related fatigue or quality of life). We excluded combined cardiovascular and resistance interventions, yoga, and mindfulness-based interventions. Our primary outcomes were cancer-related fatigue and quality of life. Our secondary outcomes were adverse events, anxiety, and depression.
We used standard Cochrane methodology. For analyses, we pooled results within the same period of outcome assessment (i.e. short term (up to and including 12 weeks' follow-up), medium term (more than 12 weeks' to less than six months' follow-up), and long term (six months' follow-up or longer)). We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane RoB 1 tool, and certainty of the evidence using GRADE.
We included six studies with 447 participants with prostate, breast, or lung cancer who received radiotherapy or chemotherapy, had surgery, or a combination of these. All studies had a high risk of bias due to lack of blinding. Three studies had an additional high risk of bias domain; one study for attrition bias, and two studies for selection bias. Interventions in the cardiovascular training groups included training on a cycle ergometer, treadmill, an elliptical trainer, or indoor bike. Interventions in the resistance training group included a varying number of exercises using bodyweight, weights, or resistance bands. Interventions varied in frequency, intensity, and duration. None of the included studies reported including participants with a confirmed cancer-related fatigue diagnosis. The interventions in four studies started during cancer treatment and in two studies after cancer treatment. Before treatment No studies reported interventions starting before cancer treatment. During treatment the evidence was very uncertain about the effect of cardiovascular training compared with resistance training for short-term cancer-related fatigue (mean difference (MD)-0.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.52 to 1.84; 4 studies, 311 participants; Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue) scale where higher values indicate better outcome; very low-certainty evidence) and long-term cancer-related fatigue (MD 1.30, 95% CI: 2.17 to 4.77; 1 study, 141 participants; FACIT-Fatigue scale; very low-certainty evidence). The evidence was very uncertain about the effect of cardiovascular training compared with resistance training for short-term quality of life (MD 1.47, 95% CI -1.47 to 4.42; 4 studies, 319 participants; Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy General scale where higher values indicate better outcome; very low-certainty evidence) and for long-term quality of life (MD 3.40, 95% CI -4.85 to 11.65; 1 study, 141 participants; Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Anemia scale where higher values indicate better outcome; very low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of cardiovascular training compared with resistance training on the occurrence of adverse events at any follow-up (risk ratio (RR) 2.00, 95% CI 0.19 to 21.18; 2 studies, 128 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No studies reported medium-term cancer-related fatigue or quality of life. After treatment, the evidence was very uncertain about the effect of cardiovascular training compared with resistance training for short-term cancer-related fatigue (MD 1.47, 95% CI -0.09 to 3.03; 1 study, 95 participants; Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory 20 General Fatigue subscale where higher values indicate worse outcome; very low-certainty evidence). Resistance training may improve short-term quality of life compared to cardiovascular training, but the evidence is very uncertain (MD -10.96, 95% CI -17.77 to -4.15; 1 study, 95 participants; European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30 Global Health subscale where higher values indicate better outcome; very low-certainty evidence). No studies reported outcomes at medium-term or long-term follow-up. Overall, the evidence is very uncertain about the effects of cardiovascular training compared with resistance training on treatment of cancer-related fatigue in people with cancer. Larger, well-conducted studies including people with different cancer types receiving different treatments are needed to increase the certainty in the evidence and to better understand who may benefit most from cardiovascular or resistance training. Moreover, studies comparing the effects of cardiovascular and resistance training initiated before as well as after cancer treatment are needed to understand the prophylactic and rehabilitative effects of these exercise types on cancer-related fatigue.","Fatigue caused by cancer is a feeling of extreme tiredness that lasts for a long time. It is related to cancer or cancer treatment, or both. It affects both the body and feelings, and can make it difficult to do regular activities. Fatigue caused by cancer is a lot worse than regular tiredness, and it does not go away with more sleep or rest.
We wanted to find out if there are differences between cardiovascular training and resistance training for the treatment and prevention of fatigue caused by cancer, well-being (also known as quality of life), and unwanted effects. Cardiovascular training involves exercise such as walking, running, swimming, and cycling, whereas resistance training includes exercise using one's own bodyweight, weights, or elastic therapy bands.
We searched for studies that compared cardiovascular training and resistance training in people with any type of cancer. Training could have been started before, during, or after cancer treatment.
We summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.
We found six studies that involved 447 people with breast cancer, prostate cancer (a small gland in the pelvis that is part of the male reproductive system), or lung cancer. These studies did not report if people already had fatigue caused by cancer before starting to exercise. People in these studies were treated with chemotherapy (medicines to kill the cancer), radiotherapy (radiation directed at the cancer to reduce or kill it), surgery (to remove the cancer), or a combination of these. The cardiovascular or resistance training started during or after cancer treatment. Most studies looked at short-term results (up to and including 12 weeks of monitoring), only one study had long-term results (six months or longer of monitoring). Studies were supported by research grants and took place in Canada, Belgium, the USA, and Germany.
The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of cardiovascular and resistance training on fatigue caused by cancer, well-being, and unwanted effects in the short or long term.
Our confidence in the evidence is very low. We found only a few studies including low numbers of people. We also found problems in the methods of the studies.

63eda5a4a87d8bd73853fa8e,static_2,Does treating the coronary arteries of the heart help prevent heart attacks during major blood vessels surgeries?,"Postoperative myocardial infarction (POMI) is associated with major surgeries and remains the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in people undergoing vascular surgery, with an incidence rate ranging from 5% to 20%. Preoperative coronary interventions, such as coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI), may help prevent acute myocardial infarction in the perioperative period of major vascular surgery when used in addition to routine perioperative drugs (e.g. statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and antiplatelet agents), CABG by creating new blood circulation routes that bypass the blockages in the coronary vessels, and PCI by opening up blocked blood vessels. There is currently uncertainty around the benefits and harms of preoperative coronary interventions.
To assess the effects of preoperative coronary interventions for preventing acute myocardial infarction in the perioperative period of major open vascular or endovascular surgery.
We searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, LILACS, and CINAHL EBSCO on 13 March 2023. We also searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov.
We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs that compared the use of preoperative coronary interventions plus usual care versus usual care for preventing acute myocardial infarction during major open vascular or endovascular surgery. We included participants of any sex or any age undergoing major open vascular surgery, major endovascular surgery, or hybrid vascular surgery.
We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes of interest were acute myocardial infarction, all-cause mortality, and adverse events resulting from preoperative coronary interventions. Our secondary outcomes were cardiovascular mortality, quality of life, vessel or graft secondary patency, and length of hospital stay. We reported perioperative and long-term outcomes (more than 30 days after intervention). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.
We included three RCTs (1144 participants). Participants were randomised to receive either preoperative coronary revascularisation with PCI or CABG plus usual care or only usual care before major vascular surgery. One trial enrolled participants if they had no apparent evidence of coronary artery disease. Another trial selected participants classified as high risk for coronary disease through preoperative clinical and laboratorial testing. We excluded one trial from the meta-analysis because participants from both the control and the intervention groups were eligible to undergo preoperative coronary revascularisation. We identified a high risk of performance bias in all included trials, with one trial displaying a high risk of other bias. However, the risk of bias was either low or unclear in other domains. We observed no difference between groups for perioperative acute myocardial infarction, but the evidence is very uncertain (risk ratio (RR) 0.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 4.57; 2 trials, 888 participants; very low-certainty evidence). One trial showed a reduction in incidence of long-term (> 30 days) acute myocardial infarction in participants allocated to the preoperative coronary interventions plus usual care group, but the evidence was very uncertain (RR 0.09, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.28; 1 trial, 426 participants; very low-certainty evidence). There was little to no effect on all-cause mortality in the perioperative period when comparing the preoperative coronary intervention plus usual care group to usual care alone, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.31 to 2.04; 2 trials, 888 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of preoperative coronary interventions on long-term (follow up: 2.7 to 6.2 years) all-cause mortality (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.80; 2 trials, 888 participants; very low-certainty evidence). One study reported no adverse effects related to coronary angiography, whereas the other two studies reported five deaths due to revascularisations. There may be no effect on cardiovascular mortality when comparing preoperative coronary revascularisation plus usual care to usual care in the short term (RR 0.07, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.32; 1 trial, 426 participants; low-certainty evidence). Preoperative coronary interventions plus usual care in the short term may reduce length of hospital stay slightly when compared to usual care alone (mean difference -1.17 days, 95% CI -2.05 to -0.28; 1 trial, 462 participants; low-certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence due to concerns about risk of bias, imprecision, and inconsistency. None of the included trials reported on quality of life or vessel graft patency at either time point, and no study reported on adverse effects, cardiovascular mortality, or length of hospital stay at long-term follow-up.
Preoperative coronary interventions plus usual care may have little or no effect on preventing perioperative acute myocardial infarction and reducing perioperative all-cause mortality compared to usual care, but the evidence is very uncertain. Similarly, limited, very low-certainty evidence shows that preoperative coronary interventions may have little or no effect on reducing long-term all-cause mortality. There is very low-certainty evidence that preoperative coronary interventions plus usual care may prevent long-term myocardial infarction, and low-certainty evidence that they may reduce length of hospital stay slightly, but not cardiovascular mortality in the short term, when compared to usual care alone. Adverse effects of preoperative coronary interventions were poorly reported in trials. Quality of life and vessel or graft patency were not reported. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence most frequently for high risk of bias, inconsistency, or imprecision. None of the analysed trials provided significant data on subgroups of patients who could potentially experience more substantial benefits from preoperative coronary intervention (e.g. altered ventricular ejection fraction). There is a need for evidence from larger and homogeneous RCTs to provide adequate statistical power to assess the role of preoperative coronary interventions for preventing acute myocardial infarction in the perioperative period of major open vascular or endovascular surgery.","Heart attacks are an important complication after surgery (postoperative myocardial infarction). This complication plays a large role in major vascular surgeries. Postoperative myocardial infarction is the leading cause of morbidity (illness) and mortality (death) after major vascular surgeries. Coronary artery disease is a condition that affects the blood vessels of the heart (coronary arteries) and occurs when these vessels are narrowed by a plaque (atherosclerosis), usually made of cholesterol. This disease is the main cause of myocardial infarction (when the narrowing progresses to a blockage of the vessel). Atherosclerosis could explain the association between postoperative myocardial infarction and major vascular surgery, as it is the most common cause of both diseases.
We wanted to find out whether treating the coronary arteries prior to major vascular surgery (preoperative coronary interventions) can prevent postoperative myocardial infarction. Treatments to the coronary arteries consist of placing a catheter (thin tube) into an artery, usually in the leg or arm (percutaneous coronary intervention) and inserting it until it reaches the heart where a dye is injected to see if there is a narrowing of the coronary arteries (coronary angiography). Then, if a narrowing is identified, stents are used to open the blood vessels again bringing back the blood flow (coronary revascularisation). Another option for coronary revascularisation is coronary artery bypass graft (a surgical procedure used to bypass blockages in the coronary arteries). We wanted to know if identifying and treating people with severe coronary artery disease before vascular surgery decreases the number of heart attacks after vascular surgery.
We searched for trials that compared one group that received coronary treatments before major vascular surgery plus standard preoperative care (medical management or usual care) versus another group that received standard preoperative care (medical management or usual care) without coronary interventions. We wanted to know if there was a difference between groups in rates of heart attacks, mortality, or adverse outcomes. We compared these outcomes among trials and summarised our findings and then looked at whether the evidence was less or more reliable.
We found three trials involving 1144 participants. The trials compared either coronary angiography or coronary revascularisation, or both, before vascular surgery plus usual care to usual care alone (e.g. statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and antiplatelet agents). The studies used different criteria to select their participants, for example including only those at high risk for coronary artery disease, or also including individuals at low risk. We were not able to combine data from one trial in our summary because a large number of participants in the usual care group also underwent coronary treatments.
We found that treating the coronary arteries before vascular surgery may decrease the long-term rate of heart attacks, but we are very uncertain about the results. Further, they may reduce length of hospital stay slightly in the short term compared to usual care alone. We did not find any difference between groups in short- and long-term mortality and in short-term heart attack rate. None of the trials reported all the outcomes that we were interested in. Adverse events were poorly reported in trials: one study reported no deaths due to coronary angiography, whereas the other two studies reported five deaths due to coronary revascularisation.
We have little confidence in the results because participants and researchers were aware of which groups participants had been assigned to, which could have influenced the results. In addition, trials used different criteria to select their participants and used different methods, making it difficult to compare results. Finally, the overall results included the likelihood of having both benefit or harm from treatment to the coronary arteries before vascular surgery. None of the analysed trials provided information on subgroups of patients who could potentially experience greater benefits from the treatments under study, such as those with altered ventricular ejection fraction (ability of the heart to pump blood).",1038,Postoperative myocardial infarction; preoperative coronary interventions; coronary artery bypass grafting; percutaneous coronary interventions; coronary revascularisation; coronary artery disease; major vascular surgery; cardiovascular mortality; vessel graft patency; coronary angiography,How do the results address the effectiveness of preoperative coronary interventions in reducing long-term myocardial infarction?,What limitations did the study encounter in assessing the adverse events of preoperative coronary interventions?,Select all of the following that are colors,Identify the main reason for conducting the study on preoperative coronary interventions.,Summarize the study's findings on the effect of preoperative coronary interventions on short-term mortality rates.,"The results definitively show a reduction in long-term myocardial infarction; The results suggest a possible reduction, but with very low certainty; The results clearly indicate no effect on long-term myocardial infarction","The results suggest a possible reduction, but with very low certainty",Adverse events were frequently recorded in great detail; Adverse events were poorly reported in the trials; The study focused solely on adverse events,Adverse events were poorly reported in the trials,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,To determine if these interventions prevent postoperative myocardial infarctions; To develop new surgical techniques; To compare different medications for coronary artery disease,To determine if these interventions prevent postoperative myocardial infarctions,There is no difference between groups in short-term mortality rates; Short-term mortality rates significantly decrease; Short-term mortality rates significantly increase,There is no difference between groups in short-term mortality rates
63eda5a4a87d8bd73853fa8e,interactive_3,Vitamin and mineral supplementation for preventing dementia or delaying cognitive decline in people with mild cognitive impairment,"Vitamins and minerals have many functions in the nervous system which are important for brain health. It has been suggested that various different vitamin and mineral supplements might be useful in maintaining cognitive function and delaying the onset of dementia. In this review, we sought to examine the evidence for this in people who already had mild cognitive impairment (MCI). To evaluate the effects of vitamin and mineral supplementation on cognitive function and the incidence of dementia in people with mild cognitive impairment. We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Groups (CDCIG) specialised register, as well as MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CENTRAL, CINAHL, LILACs, Web of Science Core Collection, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO Portal/ICTRP, from inception to 25 January 2018. We included randomised or quasi-randomised, placebo-controlled trials which evaluated orally administered vitamin or mineral supplements in participants with a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment and which assessed the incidence of dementia or cognitive outcomes, or both. We were interested in studies applicable to the general population of older people and therefore excluded studies in which participants had severe vitamin or mineral deficiencies. We sought data on our primary outcomes of dementia incidence and overall cognitive function and on secondary outcomes of episodic memory, executive function, speed of processing, quality of life, functional performance, clinical global impression, adverse events, and mortality. We conducted data collection and analysis according to standard Cochrane systematic review methods. We assessed the risk of bias of included studies using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' assessment tool. We grouped vitamins and minerals according to their putative mechanism of action and, where we considered it to be clinically appropriate, we pooled data using random-effects methods. We used GRADE methods to assess the overall quality of evidence for each comparison and outcome. We included five trials with 879 participants which investigated B vitamin supplements. In four trials, the intervention was a combination of vitamins B6, B12, and folic acid; in one, it was folic acid only. Doses varied. We considered there to be some risks of performance and attrition bias and of selective outcome reporting among these trials. Our primary efficacy outcomes were the incidence of dementia and scores on measures of overall cognitive function. None of the trials reported the incidence of dementia and the evidence on overall cognitive function was of very low-quality. There was probably little or no effect of B vitamins taken for six to 24 months on episodic memory, executive function, speed of processing, or quality of life. The evidence on our other secondary clinical outcomes, including harms, was very sparse or very low-quality. There was evidence from one study that there may be a slower rate of brain atrophy over two years in participants taking B vitamins. The same study reported subgroup analyses based on the level of serum homocysteine (tHcy) at baseline and found evidence that B vitamins may improve episodic memory in those with tHcy above the median at baseline. We included one trial (n = 516) of vitamin E supplementation. Vitamin E was given as 1000 IU of alpha-tocopherol twice daily. We considered this trial to be at risk of attrition and selective reporting bias. There was probably no effect of vitamin E on the probability of progression from MCI to Alzheimer's dementia over three years (HR 1.02; 95% CI 0.74 to 1.41; n = 516; 1 study, moderate-quality evidence). There was also no evidence of an effect at intermediate time points. The available data did not allow us to conduct analyses, but the authors reported no significant effect of three years of supplementation with vitamin E on overall cognitive function, episodic memory, speed of processing, clinical global impression, functional performance, adverse events, or mortality (five deaths in each group). We considered this to be low-quality evidence. We included one trial (n = 256) of combined vitamin E and vitamin C supplementation and one trial (n = 26) of supplementation with chromium picolinate. In both cases, there was a single eligible cognitive outcome, but we considered the evidence to be very low-quality and so could not be sure of any effects. The evidence on vitamin and mineral supplements as treatments for MCI is very limited. Three years of treatment with high-dose vitamin E probably does not reduce the risk of progression to dementia, but we have no data on this outcome for other supplements. Only B vitamins have been assessed in more than one RCT. There is no evidence for beneficial effects on cognition of supplementation with B vitamins for six to 24 months. Evidence from a single study of a reduced rate of brain atrophy in participants taking vitamin B and a beneficial effect of vitamin B on episodic memory in those with higher tHcy at baseline warrants attempted replication.","This review investigated whether people with mild cognitive impairment can reduce their risk of developing dementia, or can prevent their memory or other thinking skills from deteriorating further, by taking vitamin or mineral supplements. Slight changes in memory and thinking skills are common as people get older. When these changes are worse than can be expected in normal ageing, but are not bad enough to make a person's usual activities difficult to manage, then the person is said to have mild cognitive impairment (MCI). People with MCI are at increased risk of developing dementia in the future.
Vitamins and minerals are naturally occurring substances which are needed in the diet to maintain health. They have lots of different functions in the body and many are essential to keep the brain working properly. It has been suggested that supplementing a person's normal diet with extra doses of these vitamins or minerals might help to maintain thinking skills or prevent dementia.
We found eight randomised controlled trials (RCTs), which investigated four different types of vitamin or mineral pills by comparing them to a placebo (a dummy pill). The vitamins tested were B vitamins (vitamin B6, vitamin B12 and folic acid), vitamin E, and vitamin E and C given together. The only mineral tested was chromium. The amount and quality of research evidence about vitamin and mineral supplements for treating MCI in people without nutritional deficiency is limited. At the moment, it is not possible to identify any supplements which can reduce the risk of people with MCI developing dementia or which can effectively treat their symptoms.",1129,mild cognitive impairment; dementia; B vitamins; brain atrophy; episodic memory; executive function; speed of processing; functional performance; alpha-tocopherol; homocysteine level,What conclusions can be drawn from the study regarding the efficacy of B vitamins on overall cognitive function in people with mild cognitive impairment?,How does the evidence from the review support or refute the use of vitamin E in preventing progression to Alzheimer's dementia over three years?,Select the items that are animals,What factors would need to be addressed in future research to improve the reliability of findings related to vitamin supplementation and cognitive outcomes?,What was the primary focus of the study?,B vitamins significantly improve overall cognitive function.; B vitamins have little or no effect on overall cognitive function.; B vitamins show potential for improving overall cognitive function.,B vitamins have little or no effect on overall cognitive function.,Vitamin E has no significant effect on the progression to Alzheimer's dementia.; Vitamin E significantly reduces the risk of AlzheimerÃ¢ÂÂs dementia.; Vitamin E may have a potential impact on delaying AlzheimerÃ¢ÂÂs dementia.,Vitamin E has no significant effect on the progression to Alzheimer's dementia.,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,Increased sample sizes and long-term studies.; Exclusive focus on vitamin D supplementation.; Only testing on participants with severe deficiencies.,Increased sample sizes and long-term studies.,Reducing the risk of developing dementia with supplements; Developing new vitamin supplements; Improving physical fitness in the elderly,Reducing the risk of developing dementia with supplements
63eda5a4a87d8bd73853fa8e,interactive_4,Is molnupiravir (an antiviral medicine) safe and effective in treating people with COVID-19?,"To assess the effects of molnupiravir in people with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and mild to moderate symptoms. We identified all relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) by searching the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, Science Citation Index Expanded, the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Literature on Coronavirus Disease database, and the COVID Network Meta-Analysis database with no language restrictions up to 26 April 2024. In outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19, molnupiravir 800 mg taken orally every 12 hours for five days probably results in little to no difference in all-cause mortality and may result in little to no difference in rates of hospitalisation and symptom resolution. There is evidence of increased viral clearance by day 5, but the clinical relevance of this finding is unclear. There is probably little to no difference in adverse events, and there is little to no difference in serious adverse events, with molnupiravir versus placebo or standard care. Inpatient data are lacking, and there is no evidence of benefit of molnupiravir in this population. Further research involving inpatients may change this.","Molnupiravir is a pill used to treat COVID-19 in people who are at high risk of developing severe illness. It works by interfering with the ability of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) to reproduce, helping the body to fight off the infection. We wanted to find out how molnupiravir compares to no treatment, placebo (dummy treatment), or standard of care in decreasing death and hospitalisation in people with COVID-19; speeding up recovery (time to symptom resolution); clearing the virus that causes COVID-19 (viral clearance); safety, by looking at all unwanted events and serious unwanted events. We searched for studies that evaluated molnupiravir compared with no treatment, placebo, or standard of care in people with confirmed COVID-19. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods. The types of studies we looked at were randomised controlled trials, which assign people randomly to two or more treatment groups. This is the best way to ensure that study groups are similar, and that investigators and participants don't know who is in which group. The review included 11 studies with 31,272 participants, mostly outpatients (people not admitted to hospital) with mild to moderate COVID-19. When we combined results from studies that recruited outpatients (people not admitted to hospital) with mild to moderate COVID-19, we found the following key results: Molnupiravir probably results in little to no difference in the risk of death. Compared with people receiving placebo or standard of care, between four and 10 fewer people receiving molnupiravir will die within one month for every 10,000 people treated. We considered this reduction clinically insignificant. Molnupiravir may not reduce hospitalisations, meaning it may not prevent people from getting sicker or needing hospital care. There was evidence of increased viral clearance with molnupiravir by day 5, but this effect diminished by day 14, and we are not sure if it makes any real difference for patients. Molnupiravir may have little to no effect on the probability of having no symptoms by day 14 or day 28. Molnupiravir probably results in little to no difference in adverse events, and results in little to no difference in serious adverse events. There are too few data to draw clear conclusions about molnupiravir's effects in people admitted to hospital with severe COVID-19. Most evidence comes from studies conducted in outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19, so the results may not apply to people with severe illness who are hospitalised. The studies provided scarce evidence on long-term outcomes such as quality of life after recovery or how long the virus stays in the body. We were unable to analyse whether molnupiravir had a different effect in certain groups of people, like those with severe pre-existing conditions or people from low- or middle-income countries.",1106,molnupiravir; SARS-CoV-2; mild to moderate COVID-19; all-cause mortality; symptom resolution; viral clearance; clinical relevance; adverse events,What reasoning could justify the conclusion that molnupiravir has little effect on hospitalisations in mild COVID-19 cases?,How might the design of future studies be improved to better assess molnupiravir's effectiveness in severe COVID-19 cases?,Select the items that are animals,What conclusions might be drawn from the evidence of increased viral clearance by day 5 with no significant impact on symptoms?,What challenges could arise in interpreting the clinical relevance of viral clearance associated with molnupiravir?,No significant difference in hospitalisation rates compared to placebo; Possible misinterpretation of viral clearance as recovery; Bias introduced by non-randomized study designs,No significant difference in hospitalisation rates compared to placebo,Including a larger sample of hospitalised patients; Excluding all outpatients to reduce variability; Focusing on participants from higher-income countries,Including a larger sample of hospitalised patients,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,Viral clearance may not correlate directly with clinical outcomes; The study possibly had errors in measuring viral load; Molnupiravir has a durable effect lasting beyond day 5,Viral clearance may not correlate directly with clinical outcomes,Lack of alignment between viral clearance and patient recovery; Overstated results from non-peer-reviewed studies; Underrepresentation of severe cases in the data,Lack of alignment between viral clearance and patient recovery
63eda5a4a87d8bd73853fa8e,interactive_4,Does the DASH diet help people with or at risk of cardiovascular diseases?,"The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet is designed to lower blood pressure and improve cardiovascular health by reducing sodium and unhealthy fats while increasing nutrients such as potassium, calcium, magnesium, and fibre. While evidence supports its benefits for managing cardiovascular risk factors, gaps remain in understanding its long-term impact on preventing cardiovascular disease, particularly major outcomes like myocardial infarction and stroke. This review assessed the effects of the DASH diet for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. We used standard Cochrane search methods, with the latest search conducted in May 2024. We included randomised controlled trials comparing DASH diet interventions to no intervention, minimal intervention (brief dietary advice or informational leaflets without a structured programme), or other dietary interventions, with adult participants who had or did not have cardiovascular disease. Interventions lasted at least eight weeks, with a minimum follow-up of three months. Primary outcomes were myocardial infarction, heart failure, and stroke; secondary outcomes included revascularisation procedures, all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, changes in blood pressure and blood lipids, incidence of type 2 diabetes, health-related quality of life, and adverse effects. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence. Five trials involving 1397 participants met inclusion criteria; all were primary prevention trials involving generally healthy adults without diagnosed cardiovascular disease. Intervention durations ranged from 16 weeks to 12 months, with follow-up periods up to 18 months. Trials were conducted in the USA and Poland, funded by public institutions. In comparisons of the DASH diet versus no intervention, one small trial reported no myocardial infarctions, strokes, or deaths, with low or very low certainty due to high or unclear risk of bias and imprecision. No data were available for heart failure or revascularisation procedures. In comparisons of the DASH diet versus minimal intervention, two trials reported very few myocardial infarctions and no strokes, with no clear differences between groups (RR for myocardial infarction 2.99, 95% CI 0.12 to 73.04), and no data for heart failure, mortality, or revascularisation outcomes. In comparisons of the DASH diet versus another dietary intervention, one trial reported no clear difference in all-cause mortality (RR 2.98, 95% CI 0.12 to 72.42), with very low certainty of evidence. Across comparisons, the DASH diet may lower blood pressure, total cholesterol, and triglycerides and increase HDL cholesterol relative to no intervention or usual care, but appears to have little to no effect on LDL cholesterol. Reported adverse effects were minimal, though the absence of long-term safety data limits conclusions. Overall, the effects of the DASH diet on major cardiovascular outcomes myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality remain uncertain due to the limited number of trials, small sample sizes, high risk of bias, and short follow-up durations. All included studies evaluated primary prevention, with no evidence for secondary prevention. Well-designed, long-term randomised controlled trials are needed to determine the DASH diets true impact on major cardiovascular events, its role in secondary prevention, and its long-term safety.","Cardiovascular disease refers to conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels, usually caused by a build-up of fatty deposits inside the vessels that can narrow them and lead to blood clots. These clots may block blood flow to the heart and cause a heart attack, or cut off blood supply to the brain and cause a stroke. Cardiovascular disease is a major cause of death and disability, but many cases can be prevented through healthy lifestyle choices. Diet is one of the most important and well-known risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The DASH diet was developed to help lower high blood pressure, a key contributor to heart disease. It focuses on eating fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins, while reducing salt, red meat, and sugar. There is strong evidence that the DASH diet can lower blood pressure, which might help prevent heart disease, but its effects on preventing heart attacks and strokes are not yet fully understood. Prevention can be primary (preventing the first event) or secondary (preventing another event in people who already have heart disease). We wanted to find out whether the DASH diet can prevent cardiovascular diseases in people with or without existing heart disease, and whether it causes any unwanted effects. To answer this, we searched for studies comparing the DASH diet with a regular diet, a minimal intervention (such as general advice or information leaflets), or another structured diet programme like the Mediterranean diet. We summarised the findings and assessed how confident we could be in the evidence. We found five studies involving 1397 people, all of whom did not have cardiovascular disease, meaning the studies assessed the DASH diet for primary prevention only. No studies looked at people who already had cardiovascular disease. The studies lasted between 16 weeks and 18 months and were funded by public or nonprofit organisations, including the US National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute, and the Institute of Cardiology in Poland. Overall, the evidence remains unclear on whether the DASH diet reduces the risk of major cardiovascular events such as heart attacks, strokes, the need for heart procedures, or death from cardiovascular disease. The DASH diet may not cause harmful effects, but the evidence is limited, so we cannot be certain. There were several limitations to the evidence. People in some studies may have known which diet they were following, which could influence results. All studies included participants without cardiovascular disease, leaving us unable to assess whether the DASH diet helps people who already have heart disease. Studies were also small and relatively short, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions about long-term benefits or safety. Larger, well-designed studies with longer follow-up are needed to clarify how effective the DASH diet is at preventing serious heart problems and whether it is safe over the long term.",1046,DASH diet; cardiovascular health; hypertension; myocardial infarction; stroke; cardiovascular disease; primary prevention; secondary prevention; revascularisation procedures; LDL cholesterol,What does the absence of data on secondary prevention reveal about the study's scope regarding cardiovascular disease?,What was the primary focus of the review related to the DASH diet?,Select all of the following that are colors,What are examples of unhealthy dietary components reduced by the DASH diet?,What dietary elements does the DASH diet focus on increasing?,The study provides comprehensive insights into DASH diet effects for all patients.; It highlights a gap in understanding the DASH diet's impact on those with existing heart disease.; The study intentionally excluded secondary prevention for focus on initial prevention.,It highlights a gap in understanding the DASH diet's impact on those with existing heart disease.,Evaluating weight loss results; Preventing cardiovascular diseases; Increasing muscular strength,Preventing cardiovascular diseases,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,"Sodium, red meat, sugar; Fruits and vegetables; Calcium and magnesium","Sodium, red meat, sugar","Fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins; Dairy products and processed foods; Fried foods and sweets","Fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins"
63eda5a4a87d8bd73853fa8e,finetuned_5,Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor agonists for acute stroke,"Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor agonists have been shown to have a neuroprotectant effect in reducing infarct size and improving functional outcome in animal models of cerebrovascular disease. However, the sedative effects of GABA receptor agonists have limited their wider application in people with acute stroke, due to the potential risk of stupor. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2013, and previously updated in 2014 and 2016. To determine the efficacy and safety of GABA receptor agonists in the treatment of acute stroke. We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (accessed May 2018), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) 2018, Issue 4 (accessed May 2018), MEDLINE (from 1949 to May 2018), Embase (from 1980 to May 2018), CINAHL (from 1982 to May 2018), AMED (from 1985 to May 2018), and 11 Chinese databases (accessed May 2018). In an effort to identify further published, unpublished, and ongoing trials we searched ongoing trial registers, reference lists, and relevant conference proceedings, and contacted authors and pharmaceutical companies. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating GABA receptor agonists versus placebo for people with acute stroke (within 12 hours after stroke onset), with the primary outcomes of efficacy and safety. Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of identified records, selected studies for inclusion, extracted eligible data, cross-checked the data for accuracy, and assessed the risk of bias. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence. We included five trials with 3838 participants (acute ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke patients, 3758 analyzed). Most of the participants recruited had acute ischaemic stroke, with limited data available from participants with other stroke subtypes, including total anterior circulation syndrome (TACS). The methodological quality of the included trials was generally good, with an unclear risk for selection bias only. For death and dependency at three months, pooled results did not find a significant difference for chlormethiazole versus placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96 to 1.11; four trials; 2909 participants; moderate-quality evidence) and for diazepam versus placebo (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.07; one trial; 849 participants; moderate-quality evidence). The most frequent adverse events related to chlormethiazole were somnolence (RR 4.56, 95% CI 3.50 to 5.95; two trials; 2527 participants; moderate-quality evidence) and rhinitis (RR 4.75, 95% CI 2.67 to 8.46; two trials; 2527 participants; moderate-quality evidence). This review provides moderate-quality evidence that fails to support the use of GABA receptor agonists (chlormethiazole or diazepam) for the treatment of people with acute stroke. More well-designed RCTs with large samples of participants with total anterior circulation syndrome are required to determine if there are benefits for this subgroup. Somnolence and rhinitis are frequent adverse events related to chlormethiazole.","Background : GABA receptor agonists are a type of drug that may help protect the brain in acute stroke. This group of drugs, which includes diazepam and chlormethiazole, has been used as traditional sedatives for several decades, and have been found to be beneficial in stroke studies in animals. However, the sedative effect of GABA receptor agonists could be harmful for people with acute stroke. Study characteristics : We identified five studies to May 2018 that met our inclusion criteria; they randomized 3838 participants (acute ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke patients) and analyzed 3758. The quality of all the studies was generally good, with a low risk of bias. One study tested the effects and safety of diazepam for acute stroke in 849 participants within 12 hours of stroke onset. Four studies tested the effects and safety of chlormethiazole in 2909 participants with acute stroke, within 12 hours of stroke onset; 95 participants had stroke caused by bleeding and were analyzed separately. Key results : All five trials reported death and dependency at three months. There was no significant difference between the chlormethiazole and placebo groups or between the diazepam and placebo groups. The most frequent side effects caused by chlormethiazole were drowsiness and nasal irritation.

63eda5a4a87d8bd73853fa8e,finetuned_6,Oral Class I and III antiarrhythmic drugs for maintaining sinus rhythm after catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation,"Recurrence of atrial tachyarrhythmias (ATa) following catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common problem. Antiarrhythmic drugs have been used shortly after ablation in an attempt to maintain sinus rhythm, particularly Class I and III agents. However, it still needs to be established if the use of Class I or III antiarrhythmic medications, or both, reduce the risk of recurrence of ATa.
To assess the effects of oral Class I and III antiarrhythmic drugs versus control (standard medical therapy without Class I or III antiarrhythmics, or placebo) for maintaining sinus rhythm in people undergoing catheter ablation for AF.
We systematically searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science Core Collection, and two clinical trial registers without restrictions on language or date to 5 August 2022.
We sought published, unpublished, and ongoing parallel-design, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving adult participants undergoing ablation for AF, with subsequent comparison of Class I and/or III antiarrhythmic use versus control (standard medical therapy or non-Class I and/or III antiarrhythmic use).
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane and performed meta-analyses with risk ratios (RR) and Peto odds ratios (Peto OR). Our primary outcomes were recurrence of atrial tachyarrhythmias; adverse events: thromboembolic events; adverse events: myocardial infarction; adverse events: new diagnosis of heart failure; and adverse events: requirement for one or more hospitalisations for atrial tachyarrhythmia. Our secondary outcomes were: all-cause mortality; and requirement for one or more repeat ablations. Where possible, we performed comparison analysis by Class I and/or III antiarrhythmic and divided follow-up periods for our primary outcome. We performed comprehensive assessments of risk of bias and certainty of evidence applying the GRADE methodology.
We included nine RCTs involving a total of 3269 participants. Participants were on average 59.3 years old; 71.0% were male; and 72.9% and 27.4% had paroxysmal and persistent AF, respectively. Class I and/or III antiarrhythmics may reduce recurrence of ATa at 0 to 3 months postablation (risk ratio (RR) 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 0.94, 8 trials, 3046 participants, low-certainty evidence) and likely reduce recurrence at > 3 to 6 months, our a priori primary time point (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.93, 5 trials, 2591 participants, moderate-certainty evidence). Beyond six months the evidence is very uncertain, and the benefit of antiarrhythmics may not persist (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.55, 4 trials, 2244 participants, very low-certainty evidence). The evidence suggests that Class I and/or III antiarrhythmics may not increase the risk of thromboembolic events, myocardial infarction, all-cause mortality, or requirement for repeat ablation, at 0 to 3, > 3 to 6, and > 6 months (where data were available; low- to very low-certainty evidence). The use of Class I and/or III antiarrhythmics postablation likely reduces hospitalisations for ATa by approximately 57% at 0 to 3 months (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.64, moderate-certainty evidence). No data were available beyond three months. No data were available on new diagnoses of heart failure. Fewer data were available for Class I and III antiarrhythmics individually. Based on only one and two trials (n = 125 to 309), Class I antiarrhythmics may have little effect on recurrence of ATa at 0 to 3, > 3 to 6, and > 6 months (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.20, 2 trials, 309 participants; RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.19, 1 trial, 125 participants; RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.32, 1 trial, 125 participants; low-certainty evidence throughout); requirement for hospitalisation for ATa at 0 to 3 months (low-certainty evidence); or requirement for repeat ablation at 0 to 3 months (low-certainty evidence). No data were available for thromboembolic events, myocardial infarction, new diagnosis of heart failure, or all-cause mortality at any time points, or hospitalisation or repeat ablation beyond three months. Class III antiarrhythmics may have little effect on recurrence of ATa at up to 3 months and at > 3 to 6 months (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.16, 4 trials, 599 participants, low-certainty evidence; RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.09, 2 trials, 318 participants, low-certainty evidence), and beyond 6 months one trial reported a possible increase in recurrence of ATa (RR 1.95, 95% CI 1.29 to 2.94, 1 trial, 112 participants, low-certainty evidence). Class III antiarrhythmics likely reduce hospitalisations for ATa at 0 to 3 months (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.63, moderate-certainty evidence), and may have little effect on all-cause mortality (low- to very low-certainty evidence). The effect of Class III antiarrhythmics on thromboembolic events and requirement for repeat ablation was uncertain (very low-certainty evidence for both outcomes). No data were available for myocardial infarction or new diagnosis of heart failure at any time point, outcomes other than recurrence beyond 6 months, or for hospitalisation and repeat ablation > 3 to 6 months. We assessed the majority of included trials as at low or unclear risk of bias. One trial reported an error in the randomisation process, raising the potential risk of selection bias; most of the included trials were non-blinded; and two trials were at high risk of attrition bias.
We found evidence to suggest that the use of Class I and/or III antiarrhythmics up to 3 months after ablation is associated with a reduced recurrence of ATa 0 to 6 months after ablation, which may not persist beyond 6 months, and an immediate reduction in hospitalisation for ATa 0 to 3 months after ablation. The evidence suggests there is no difference in rates of all-cause mortality, thromboembolic events, or myocardial infarction between Class I and/or III antiarrhythmics versus control.","We wanted to find out how effective certain classes of antiarrhythmic drugs (medications used to prevent or treat an irregular heart rhythm) are for maintaining sinus rhythm (normal heart rhythm) in people after catheter ablation (a technique using catheters to create controlled burns in the heart to prevent and treat arrhythmia occurrence) for atrial fibrillation (a common type of irregular heart rhythm), compared to catheter ablation alone.
The most common abnormal heart rhythm, atrial fibrillation can cause the upper two chambers of the heart (atria) to beat very rapidly leading to symptoms such as palpitations, dizziness, and shortness of breath. Treatment of atrial fibrillation typically includes medications to control the heart rate and reduce the risk of stroke. However, in some people, restoring the normal heart rhythm to control symptoms is achieved by creating controlled burns with ablation catheters to eliminate atrial fibrillation. Patients often revert back to atrial fibrillation despite ablation, and certain antiarrhythmic drugs (of which we were only interested in Class I and III) are given to reduce the risk of recurrence of arrhythmia.
We performed a thorough search of databases for all trials including atrial fibrillation and all individual Class I and Class III antiarrhythmic drugs including, for example, flecainide, propafenone, amiodarone, dronedarone, and sotalol.
We conducted the search on 5 August 2022, and identified 4682 citations (papers), out of which nine were eligible randomised controlled trials (a type of study where people are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups). The studies included a total of 3269 participants from six countries, who were assigned to either Class I or III antiarrhythmics (or both) or placebo (sugar pill)/standard treatment. People taking part in the studies were on average 59 years old, and 71% were male. Most people had paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (meaning they were not in atrial fibrillation all the time and alternated with normal rhythms).
We found that the effect of Class I and/or III antiarrhythmic drugs given up to around 3 months after ablation may reduce recurrence of arrhythmia at 0 to 3 months, and likely reduces recurrence at greater than 3 to 6 months, although the benefit does not appear to continue beyond 6 months (the evidence for this last result was very uncertain). We also looked at adverse outcomes (i.e. complications). We found that the use of antiarrhythmics was probably associated with a reduction in hospitalisation at 0 to 3 months. We also found evidence suggesting that antiarrhythmics are not associated with different rates of thromboembolic events (clots in the brain, lungs, or legs), heart attacks, death due to any cause, or requirement for repeat ablation compared with control or standard treatment.
Our confidence in the evidence was low for recurrence of arrhythmias at 0 to 3 months, moderate at 3 to 6 months, and very low at greater than 6 months.

63eda5a4a87d8bd73853fa8e,finetuned_6,Immunosuppressive treatment for focal segmental glomerulosclerosis in adults,"Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) can result from primary, genetic, or secondary causes; primary disease typically leads to nephrotic syndrome, while genetic and secondary forms may present with asymptomatic proteinuria or with nephrotic syndrome. Only about 20% of patients achieve partial or complete remission with treatment, and roughly half progress to kidney failure. This updated review assessed treatments for adults with FSGS and included 15 studies with 560 participants, all of whom had steroid-resistant disease since no trials evaluated corticosteroids versus placebo despite guidelines recommending steroids as first-line therapy. Five studies compared cyclosporin, with or without prednisone, to various treatments including no specific therapy, prednisone, methylprednisolone, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and dexamethasone. Other small single trials evaluated monoclonal antibodies such as adalimumab and fresolimumab, rituximab versus tacrolimus, cyclosporin plus valsartan versus cyclosporin alone, MMF versus prednisone, chlorambucil with steroids versus no treatment, different dexamethasone regimens, CCX140-B versus placebo, and one larger study compared sparsentan to irbesartan. Evidence for cyclosporin suggested it may increase the likelihood of complete remission and of combined complete or partial remission, though results were imprecise and based on few small trials. Cyclosporin showed little to no difference in preventing chronic kidney disease progression or kidney failure, and its effects on hypertension or infection remained uncertain. MMF appeared to offer little or no difference compared to prednisone for remission outcomes or kidney function, and most other interventions had very low certainty evidence, preventing firm conclusions. It is also uncertain whether sparsentan reduces proteinuria more effectively than irbesartan. Overall, no trials evaluated the recommended first-line therapy of corticosteroids, and the available evidence applies only to steroid-resistant FSGS. Cyclosporin may improve remission rates when given for at least six months, but confidence in these findings is limited by the small size and variability of the studies. Future trials must more clearly define patient populations distinguishing primary, genetic, and secondary FSGS to support stronger treatment recommendations.","Nephrotic syndrome is a condition where the kidneys leak protein from the blood into the urine. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) defined on kidney biopsy is an uncommon cause of nephrotic syndrome disease but it progresses to kidney failure in about half of all cases. It can be divided into three groups - primary FSGS (thought to be due to a factor circulating in the blood that damages the kidneys), genetic (secondary to mutations in one or more genes), and secondary to other causes, including certain infections. Treatments aim to reduce the amount of protein in the urine completely or partly to increase the time before kidney failure develops.
We looked at all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which examined therapy with prednisone or other agents which affect the immune system such as cyclosporin and mycophenolate mofetil and other agents with or without steroid therapy. We found 15 studies involving 553 participants. In five studies cyclosporin was compared with different treatments. Combining four studies (231 participants) showed that cyclosporin was more effective than these other treatments in achieving complete remission of nephrotic syndrome. The studies were too small and lasted for too short a time to determine if cyclosporin reduced the risk of kidney failure. Nine small studies examined different medicines that suppress the body's immune system. None of these treatments reduced the amount of protein in the urine.
We found limited information that cyclosporin may reduce the amount of protein in the urine in some people with FSGS but the data are uncertain because the studies enrolled too few participants.

5ff07b5ee7a1d23e719e421e,static_1,Antidepressants for prevention of winter depression,"Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a seasonal pattern of recurrent major depressive episodes that most commonly occurs during autumn or winter and remits in spring. The prevalence of SAD ranges from 1.5% to 9%, depending on latitude. The predictable seasonal aspect of SAD provides a promising opportunity for prevention. This review - one of four reviews on efficacy and safety of interventions to prevent SAD - focuses on second-generation antidepressants (SGAs). To assess the efficacy and safety of SGAs (in comparison with other SGAs, placebo, light therapy, melatonin or agomelatine, psychological therapies or lifestyle interventions) in preventing SAD and improving patient-centred outcomes among adults with a history of SAD. We searched Ovid MEDLINE (1950- ), Embase (1974- ), PsycINFO (1967- ) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to 19 June 2018. An earlier search of these databases was conducted via the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trial Register (CCMD-CTR) (all years to 11 August 2015). Furthermore, we searched the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database and international trial registers (to 19 June 2018). We also conducted a grey literature search and handsearched the reference lists of included studies and pertinent review articles. For efficacy, we included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on adults with a history of winter-type SAD who were free of symptoms at the beginning of the study. For adverse events, we planned to include non-randomised studies. Eligible studies compared a SGA versus another SGA, placebo, light therapy, psychological therapy, melatonin, agomelatine or lifestyle changes. We also intended to compare SGAs in combination with any of the comparator interventions versus placebo or the same comparator intervention as monotherapy. Two review authors independently screened abstracts and full-text publications, extracted data and assessed risk of bias of included studies. When data were sufficient, we conducted random-effects (Mantel-Haenszel) meta-analyses. We assessed statistical heterogeneity by calculating the Chi2 statistic and the Cochran Q. We used the I2 statistic to estimate the magnitude of heterogeneity. We assessed publication bias by using funnel plots. We rated the strength of the evidence using the system developed by the GRADE Working Group. We identified 3745 citations after de-duplication of search results and excluded 3619 records during title and abstract reviews. We assessed 126 full-text papers for inclusion in the review, of which four publications (on three RCTs) providing data from 1100 people met eligibility criteria for this review. All three RCTs had methodological limitations due to high attrition rates. Overall, moderate-quality evidence indicates that bupropion XL is an efficacious intervention for prevention of recurrence of depressive episodes in people with a history of SAD (risk ratio (RR) 0.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 0.72; 3 RCTs, 1100 participants). However, bupropion XL leads to greater risk of headaches (moderate-quality evidence), insomnia and nausea (both low-quality evidence) when compared with placebo. Numbers needed to treat for additional beneficial outcomes (NNTBs) vary by baseline risks. For a population with a yearly recurrence rate of 30%, the NNTB is 8 (95% CI 6 to 12). For populations with yearly recurrence rates of 50% and 60%, NNTBs are 5 (95% CI 4 to 7) and 4 (95% CI 3 to 6), respectively. We could find no studies on other SGAs and no studies comparing SGAs with other interventions of interest, such as light therapy, psychological therapies, melatonin or agomelatine. Available evidence indicates that bupropion XL is an effective intervention for prevention of recurrence of SAD. Nevertheless, even in a high-risk population, three out of four people will not benefit from preventive treatment with bupropion XL and will be at risk for harm. Clinicians need to discuss with patients advantages and disadvantages of preventive SGA treatment, and might want to consider offering other potentially efficacious interventions, which might confer a lower risk of adverse events. Given the lack of comparative evidence, the decision for or against initiating preventive treatment of SAD and the treatment selected should be strongly based on patient preferences. Future researchers need to assess the effectiveness and risk of harms of SGAs other than bupropion for prevention of SAD. Investigators also need to compare benefits and harms of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions.","Why is this review important? Many people in northern latitudes suffer from winter blues, which occurs as a reaction to reduced sunlight. Three-quarters of those affected are women. Lethargy, overeating, craving for carbohydrates and depressed mood are common symptoms. In some people, winter blues becomes depression, which seriously affects their daily lives. Up to two-thirds experience depressive symptoms every winter. Who will be interested in this review? Anyone who has experienced winter depression. Relatives and friends of people who have experienced winter depression. General practitioners, psychiatrists and pharmacists.  Professionals working in adult mental health services. What questions does this review aim to answer? In light of the seasonal pattern and the high rate of recurrence, beginning antidepressant therapy in early autumn (fall) when people are still free of depressive symptoms can prevent the onset of depressed mood. The goal of this review is to examine whether benefits outweigh harms of antidepressants when they are used in healthy people with a history of winter depression to prevent onset of depression the next winter. To date, this question has not been examined in a systematic way. Which studies were included in the review? We searched databases up to June 2018 for studies on antidepressants given to prevent winter depression. Of 3745 records, we found three randomised controlled studies including 1100 people who received bupropion extended-release (only one of many available antidepressants, but the only one licensed for prevention of winter depression) or placebo. We found no studies on other antidepressants. What does evidence from the review reveal? In populations with a high risk of developing a new depressive episode in the next winter, results show that antidepressants can prevent winter depression in about one in four people. In populations with a lower risk of recurrence, antidepressants can prevent a new depressive episode in one of eight people. The other seven people suffer from winter depression despite treatment or would not have suffered from winter depression anyway. People using antidepressants are at slightly higher risk of experiencing headaches, nausea or insomnia when compared with people not taking antidepressants. Doctors need to discuss with patients the advantages and disadvantages of antidepressants and other potentially preventive treatments for winter depression, such as light treatment, psychological therapies or lifestyle interventions. As no available studies have compared these treatments, the decision for or against preventive treatment of SAD and the treatment selected should be strongly based on patient preferences. What should happen next? Review authors recommend that future studies should directly compare antidepressants against other treatments, such as light therapy, psychological therapies or other drugs to determine the best treatment for preventing winter depression.",1120,Seasonal affective disorder; second-generation antidepressants; bupropion XL; moderate-quality evidence; recurrence of depressive episodes; melatonin; agomelatine; psychological therapies; pharmacological interventions; non-pharmacological interventions,What inference can be made about the population that most benefits from bupropion XL in preventing winter depression?,How does the review suggest doctors should navigate treatment options for SAD?,Select all of the following that are fruits,What conclusion can be drawn about the comparative efficacy of bupropion XL versus other SGAs based on the review findings?,"In the review, which antidepressant was examined for preventing winter depression?",Populations with a yearly recurrence rate of 60%.; Patients who have never experienced depressive symptoms.; Individuals who are symptom-free during spring and summer.,Populations with a yearly recurrence rate of 60%.,By prioritizing drugs like bupropion XL over all other treatments.; By heavily considering patient preferences in treatment decisions.; By providing a one-size-fits-all treatment approach based on clinical guidelines.,By heavily considering patient preferences in treatment decisions.,dog; blue; grape,grape,Bupropion XL is the only SGA proven to prevent winter depression.; There is insufficient evidence to compare bupropion XL to other SGAs.; Other SGAs are less effective than bupropion XL.,There is insufficient evidence to compare bupropion XL to other SGAs.,Fluoxetine; Bupropion extended-release; Sertraline,Bupropion extended-release
5ff07b5ee7a1d23e719e421e,static_2,Bisphosphonates and denosumab for breast cancer,"Bone is the most common site of metastatic disease associated with breast cancer (BC). Bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, and novel targeted therapies such as denosumab inhibit other key bone metabolism pathways. We have studied these agents in both early breast cancer and advanced breast cancer settings. This is an update of the review originally published in 2002 and subsequently updated in 2005 and 2012.
To assess the effects of bisphosphonates and other bone agents in addition to anti-cancer treatment: (i) in women with early breast cancer (EBC); (ii) in women with advanced breast cancer without bone metastases (ABC); and (iii) in women with metastatic breast cancer and bone metastases (BCBM).
In this review update, we searched Cochrane Breast Cancer's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov on 19 September 2016.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing: (a) one treatment with a bisphosphonate/bone-acting agent with the same treatment without a bisphosphonate/bone-acting agent; (b) treatment with one bisphosphonate versus treatment with a different bisphosphonate; (c) treatment with a bisphosphonate versus another bone-acting agent of a different mechanism of action (e.g. denosumab); and (d) immediate treatment with a bisphosphonate/bone-acting agent versus delayed treatment of the same bisphosphonate/bone-acting agent.
Two review authors independently extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and quality of the evidence. The primary outcome measure was bone metastases for EBC and ABC, and a skeletal-related event (SRE) for BCBM. We derived risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and the meta-analyses used random-effects models. Secondary outcomes included overall survival and disease-free survival for EBC; we derived hazard ratios (HRs) for these time-to-event outcomes where possible. We collected toxicity and quality-of-life information. GRADE was used to assess the quality of evidence for the most important outcomes in each treatment setting.
We included 44 RCTs involving 37,302 women. In women with EBC, bisphosphonates were associated with a reduced risk of bone metastases compared to placebo/no bisphosphonate (RR 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75 to 0.99; P = 0.03, 11 studies; 15,005 women; moderate-quality evidence with no significant heterogeneity). Bisphosphonates provided an overall survival benefit with time-to-event data (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.99; P = 0.04; 9 studies; 13,949 women; high-quality evidence with evidence of heterogeneity). Subgroup analysis by menopausal status showed a survival benefit from bisphosphonates in postmenopausal women (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.90; P = 0.001; 4 studies; 6048 women; high-quality evidence with no evidence of heterogeneity) but no survival benefit for premenopausal women (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.22; P = 0.78; 2 studies; 3501 women; high-quality evidence with no heterogeneity). There was evidence of no effect of bisphosphonates on disease-free survival (HR 0.94, 95% 0.87 to 1.02; P = 0.13; 7 studies; 12,578 women; high-quality evidence with significant heterogeneity present) however subgroup analyses showed a disease-free survival benefit from bisphosphonates in postmenopausal women only (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.91; P < 0.001; 7 studies; 8314 women; high-quality evidence with no heterogeneity). Bisphosphonates did not significantly reduce the incidence of fractures when compared to placebo/no bisphosphonates (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.08, P = 0.13, 6 studies, 7602 women; moderate-quality evidence due to wide confidence intervals). We await mature overall survival and disease-free survival results for denosumab trials. In women with ABC without clinically evident bone metastases, there was no evidence of an effect of bisphosphonates on bone metastases (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.43; P = 0.86; 3 studies; 330 women; moderate-quality evidence with no heterogeneity) or overall survival (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.09; P = 0.28; 3 studies; 330 women; high-quality evidence with no heterogeneity) compared to placebo/no bisphosphonates however the confidence intervals were wide. One study reported a trend towards an extended period of time without a SRE with bisphosphonate compared to placebo (low-quality evidence). One study reported quality of life and there was no apparent difference in scores between bisphosphonate and placebo (moderate-quality evidence). In women with BCBM, bisphosphonates reduced the SRE risk by 14% (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.95; P = 0.003; 9 studies; 2810 women; high-quality evidence with evidence of heterogeneity) compared with placebo/no bisphosphonates. This benefit persisted when administering either intravenous or oral bisphosphonates versus placebo. Bisphosphonates delayed the median time to a SRE with a median ratio of 1.43 (95% CI 1.29 to 1.58; P < 0.00001; 9 studies; 2891 women; high-quality evidence with no heterogeneity) and reduced bone pain (in 6 out of 11 studies; moderate-quality evidence) compared to placebo/no bisphosphonate. Treatment with bisphosphonates did not appear to affect overall survival (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.11; P = 0.85; 7 studies; 1935 women; moderate-quality evidence with significant heterogeneity). Quality-of-life scores were slightly better with bisphosphonates than placebo at comparable time points (in three out of five studies; moderate-quality evidence) however scores decreased during the course of the studies. Denosumab reduced the risk of developing a SRE compared with bisphosphonates by 22% (RR 0.78, 0.72 to 0.85; P < 0.001; 3 studies, 2345 women). One study reported data on overall survival and observed no difference in survival between denosumab and bisphosphonate. Reported toxicities across all settings were generally mild. Osteonecrosis of the jaw was rare, occurring less than 0.5% in the adjuvant setting (high-quality evidence).
For women with EBC, bisphosphonates reduce the risk of bone metastases and provide an overall survival benefit compared to placebo or no bisphosphonates. There is preliminary evidence suggestive that bisphosphonates provide an overall survival and disease-free survival benefit in postmenopausal women only when compared to placebo or no bisphosphonate. This was not a planned subgroup for these early trials, and we await the completion of new large clinical trials assessing benefit for postmenopausal women. For women with BCBM, bisphosphonates reduce the risk of developing SREs, delay the median time to an SRE, and appear to reduce bone pain compared to placebo or no bisphosphonate.","Breast cancer may spread and recur in the bones. This may cause fractures, pain and high calcium in the bloodstream (known as complications).
Medicines for osteoporosis may prevent these complications and may help cure cancer by reducing cancer growth in the bone. These medicines are called 'bisphosphonates'. A newer type is called  denosumab. Bisphosphonates or denosumab are given in addition to other cancer treatment medications. These may be given along with chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, or radiotherapy.
The goal of bisphosphonates and denosumab differs based on the women's breast cancer status.
We asked three main questions:
1. For women with early breast cancer (EBC) , can bisphosphonates or denosumab reduce the risk of the cancer spreading to the bone? Will adding this medicine to anticancer treatments allow women to live longer (improve survival)?
2. For women with advanced breast cancer which does not appear to involve the bone (ABC) , can bisphosphonates reduce the risk of the cancer spreading to the bone and improve survival? Will bisphosphonates reduce complications and improve quality of life?
3. For women with metastatic breast cancer that has spread to the bone (BCBM), can bisphosphonates or denosumab reduce the risk of complication, and improve quality of life and survival?
We found 44 studies involving 37,302 participants. We included studies published by September 2016.
For women with EBC, we included 17 studies with 26,129 participants. The women's health was monitored for at least 12 months from the start of the study. Some studies monitored women for 10 years.
The studies tested different types of bisphosphonate drugs and denosumab, and different doses of these drugs. Some studies compared the drugs to no treatment. Some studies used oral medications. Other studies gave the medicine as an injection into a vein or under the skin.
Bisphosphonates probably lowered the risk of cancer spreading to the bone.
Bisphosphonates were found to improve survival, but the benefit in the whole group of women was small. Postmenopausal women had a benefit from bisphosphonates with improved survival and reduced risk of cancer returning. Premenopausal women did not have improved survival or reduced risk of the cancer returning. New studies that test bisphosphonates by the women's menopausal status are awaited.
We await the reporting of data on survival and other important outcomes from denosumab trials.
For women with ABC that had not spread to the bone, we included three studies enrolling 330 participants. All three studies compared oral bisphosphonates to no treatment.
Bisphosphonates did not reduce the risk of cancer spreading to the bone or improve survival. Very little information was available on complications and quality of life from only one study.
For women with BCBM, we included 24 studies enrolling 10,853 participants. Their health was monitored for at least 12 months. Some women were followed for 24 months. Most studies compared bisphosphonates to receiving no medication.
Bisphosphonates reduced complications (fractures and bone pain). Bisphosphonates did not appear to increase the length of time women survived. Quality of life scores were slightly better for women receiving bisphosphonates compared to similar women having no bisphosphonates.
Denosumab reduced the risk of complications compared to bisphosphonates in the three studies that collected these data. There was no benefit in survival from denosumab in the one study that collected data.
Side effects were uncommon and mild. There was a rare risk of damage to the jaw bone (osteonecrosis of the jaw).

5ff07b5ee7a1d23e719e421e,static_2,Acetylcysteine and carbocysteine to treat acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections in children without chronic broncho-pulmonary disease,"Acetylcysteine and carbocysteine are the most commonly prescribed mucolytic drugs in Brazil and many European and African countries. To our knowledge, no systematic review has been published on their efficacy and safety for acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections (RTIs) in children without chronic broncho-pulmonary disease. The objective was to assess the efficacy and safety and to establish a benefit-risk ratio of acetylcysteine and carbocysteine as symptomatic treatments for acute upper and lower RTIs in paediatric patients without chronic broncho-pulmonary disease. We searched CENTRAL (2013, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 to February week 3, 2013), EMBASE (1980 to March 2013), Micromedex (2010), Pascal (1987 to 2004) and Science Citation Index (1974 to March 2013). To study efficacy, we used randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the use of acetylcysteine or carbocysteine versus placebo, either alone or as an add-on therapy. To study safety, we used trials comparing acetylcysteine or carbocysteine versus active treatment or no treatment and case reports. In this review update two review authors (YD, MC), with help from a colleague, extracted data and assessed trial quality. We performed a subgroup analysis of children younger than two years of age. We included six trials involving 497 participants to study efficacy. They showed some benefit (e.g. reduction of cough at day seven) from mucolytic agents, although differences were of little clinical relevance. No conclusion was drawn about the subgroup of infants younger than two years because data were unavailable. Thirty-four studies, including the previous six trials involving 2064 children, were eligible to study safety. Overall safety was good but very few data were available to evaluate safety in infants younger than two years. However, 59 cases of paradoxically increased bronchorrhoea observed in infants were reported to the French pharmacovigilance system. The results have to be interpreted with caution because they are based on a limited number of participants included in studies whose methodological quality is questionable. Acetylcysteine and carbocysteine seem to have a limited efficacy and appear to be safe in children older than two years. These results should take into consideration the fact that acetylcysteine and carbocysteine are prescribed for self limiting diseases (for example, acute cough, bronchitis). Given strong concerns about safety, these drugs should only be used for acute upper and lower RTIs in the context of a RCT with regards to children younger than two years.","Acetylcysteine and carbocysteine are the most commonly prescribed drugs intended to modify the structure of bronchial secretions. This systematic review evaluated their efficacy and safety for treating acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections in children without chronic broncho-pulmonary disease, with particular attention to children younger than two years of age. Forty-nine trials met the inclusion criteria. Six trials involving 497 participants were used to assess efficacy, comparing acetylcysteine or carbocysteine with placebo. Thirty-four trials, including those six, were eligible to assess safety and involved 2064 paediatric patients. The results suggest that acetylcysteine and carbocysteine have real but limited efficacy, such as reducing cough by day seven, and appear generally safe aside from rare mild gastrointestinal side effects in children older than two years. However, these conclusions are limited by the small number of participants and questionable methodological quality. Their use should also be considered in light of the fact that these drugs are prescribed for self-limiting illnesses such as acute cough and bronchitis. In children younger than two years, due to strong concerns about safety including the possibility of increased rather than decreased bronchial secretions these drugs should only be used for acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections within the context of a randomized controlled trial.",1075,mucolytic drugs; acetylcysteine; carbocysteine; respiratory tract infections; chronic broncho-pulmonary disease; add-on therapy; pharmacovigilance system; bronchorrhoea; clinical relevance; symptomatic treatments,What was the primary objective of the systematic review on acetylcysteine and carbocysteine in children?,Which age group was given particular attention in the study of acetylcysteine and carbocysteine?,Select all of the following that are colors,"According to the summary, what is a noted effect of acetylcysteine and carbocysteine in children older than two years?",Why should acetylcysteine and carbocysteine only be used in children under two years in a controlled trial?,To assess the safety and efficacy for acute RTIs; To study their long-term impact on chronic diseases; To compare them with antibiotics,To assess the safety and efficacy for acute RTIs,Children older than two years; Children younger than two years; Adolescents,Children younger than two years,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Significant reduction of fever; Limited efficacy with mild gastrointestinal side effects; Complete resolution of respiratory infections,Limited efficacy with mild gastrointestinal side effects,Due to strong concerns about safety; They are ineffective in this age group; They have severe side effects in older children,Due to strong concerns about safety
5ff07b5ee7a1d23e719e421e,interactive_3,Does galantamine help people with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease and people with mild cognitive impairment?,"Dementia leads to progressive cognitive decline, and represents a significant health and societal burden. Its prevalence is growing, with Alzheimer's disease as the leading cause. There is no cure for Alzheimer's disease, but there are regulatory-approved pharmacological interventions, such as galantamine, for symptomatic relief.  To assess the clinical effects, including adverse effects, of galantamine in people with probable or possible Alzheimer's disease or mild cognitive impairment, and to investigate potential moderators of effect. We systematically searched the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialised Register on 14 December 2022 using the term 'galantamine'. The Register contains records of clinical trials identified from major electronic databases (including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase), trial registries, grey literature sources, and conference proceedings. We manually searched reference lists and collected information from US Food and Drug Administration documents and unpublished trial reports. We imposed no language restrictions. We included double-blind, parallel-group, randomised controlled trials comparing oral galantamine with placebo for a treatment duration exceeding four weeks in people with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease or with mild cognitive impairment. Working independently, two review authors selected studies for inclusion, assessed their quality, and extracted data. Outcomes of interest included cognitive function, change in global function, activities of daily living, functional disability, behavioural function, and adverse events. We used a fixed-effect model for meta-analytic synthesis, and presented results as Peto odds ratios (OR) or weighted mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals. We used Cochrane's original risk of bias tool (RoB 1) to assess the risk of bias in the included studies. We included 21 studies with a total of 10,990 participants. The average age of participants was 74 years, and 37% were male. The studies' durations ranged from eight weeks to two years, with 24 weeks being the most common duration. One newly included study assessed the effects of galantamine at two years, and another newly included study involved participants with severe Alzheimer's disease. Nineteen studies with 10,497 participants contributed data to the meta-analysis. All studies had low to unclear risk of bias for randomisation, allocation concealment, and blinding. We judged four studies to be at high risk of bias due to attrition and two due to selective outcome reporting. Galantamine for dementia due to Alzheimer's disease We summarise only the results for galantamine given at 8 to 12 mg twice daily (total galantamine 16 mg to 24 mg/day), assessed at six months. See the full review for results of other dosing regimens and assessment time points. There is high-certainty evidence that, compared to placebo, galantamine improves: cognitive function, as assessed with the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-cog) (MD-2.86, 95% CI -3.29 to -2.43; 6 studies, 3049 participants; minimum clinically important effect (MCID) = 2.6- to 4-point change); functional disability, as assessed with the Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD) scale (MD 2.12, 95% CI 0.75 to 3.49; 3 studies, 1275 participants); and behavioural function, as assessed with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) (MD -1.63, 95% CI -3.07 to -0.20; 2 studies, 1043 participants) at six months. Galantamine may improve global function at six months, as assessed with the Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change plus Caregiver Input (CIBIC-plus) (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.36 to 1.84; 6 studies, 3002 participants; low-certainty evidence). Participants who received galantamine were more likely than placebo-treated participants to discontinue prematurely (22.7% versus 17.2%) (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.68; 6 studies, 3336 participants; high-certainty evidence), and experience nausea (20.9% versus 8.4%) (OR 2.89, 95% CI 2.40 to 3.49; 7 studies, 3616 participants; high-certainty evidence) during the studies. Galantamine reduced death rates at six months: 1.3% of participants in the galantamine groups had died compared to 2.3% in the placebo groups (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.96; 6 studies, 3493 participants; high-certainty evidence). Galantamine for mild cognitive impairment We summarise results, assessed at two years, from two studies that gave participants galantamine at 8 to 12 mg twice daily (total galantamine 16 mg to 24 mg/day). Compared to placebo, galantamine may not improve cognitive function, as assessed with the expanded ADAS-cog for mild cognitive impairment (MD -0.21, 95% CI -0.78 to 0.37; 2 studies, 1901 participants; low-certainty evidence) or activities of daily living, assessed with the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living scale for mild cognitive impairment (MD 0.30, 95% CI -0.26 to 0.86; 2 studies, 1901 participants; low-certainty evidence). Participants who received galantamine were probably more likely to discontinue prematurely than placebo-treated participants (40.7% versus 28.6%) (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.42 to 2.05; 2 studies, 2057 participants) and to experience nausea (29.4% versus 10.7%) (OR 3.49, 95% CI 2.75 to 4.44; 2 studies, 2057 participants), both with moderate-certainty evidence. Galantamine may not reduce death rates at 24 months compared to placebo (0.5% versus 0.1%) (OR 5.03, 95% CI 0.87 to 29.10; 2 studies, 2057 participants; low-certainty evidence). Results from subgroup analysis and meta-regression suggest that an imbalance in discontinuation rates between galantamine and placebo groups, together with the use of the 'last observation carried forward' approach to outcome assessment, may potentially bias cognitive outcomes in favour of galantamine. Compared to placebo, galantamine (when given at a total dose of 16 mg to 24 mg/day) slows the decline in cognitive function, functional ability, and behaviour at six months in people with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. Galantamine probably also slows declines in global function at six months. The changes observed in cognition, assessed with the ADAS-cog scale, were clinically meaningful. Gastrointestinal-related adverse events are the primary concerns associated with galantamine use in people with dementia, which may limit its tolerability. Although death rates were generally low, participants in the galantamine groups had a reduced risk of death compared to those in the placebo groups. There is no evidence to support the use of galantamine in people with mild cognitive impairment.","Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia among older people that causes problems with memory, thinking, and behaviour. The disease worsens over time to the extent that it affects a person's ability to carry out day-to-day tasks. For people with mild cognitive impairment, symptoms affecting thinking and memory are mild and usually not serious enough to interfere with daily life and activities. Currently, there is no cure for Alzheimer's disease, but medications that can help with symptoms are available. Galantamine is one of the three cholinesterase inhibitor medications approved by the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Galantamine works by increasing the levels of a chemical in the brain, acetylcholine, that transmits signals, which may help with symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. There are no medications currently approved by regulatory bodies as treatments for mild cognitive impairment. We wanted to know whether galantamine is effective and helpful in improving the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment, in terms of memory, ability to carry out self-care, and behaviour. We also wanted to find out if galantamine causes any unwanted effects. We searched for studies that compared galantamine given by mouth to placebo (which does not contain any active ingredients but is given in the same way as the active medication) in people with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, or with mild cognitive impairment. We chose studies in which people were assigned randomly (like a flip of a coin) to receive galantamine or placebo for at least 4 weeks. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 21 studies that involved 10,990 people with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, or with mild cognitive impairment. Their average age was 74 years. Treatment durations ranged from 8 weeks to 2 years. Most studies included people with dementia due to mild or moderate Alzheimer's disease; one study involved people with severe Alzheimer's disease. Three studies included people with mild cognitive impairment. Pharmaceutical companies (Janssen / Johnson & Johnson) sponsored 16 of the 21 included studies. After 6 months of treatment, participants with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease who received galantamine had better memory, ability to do self-care activities, and behaviour than those who received placebo. Importantly, the memory improvements we observed were considered clinically meaningful according to standards set by experts. This same group of participants probably had better overall improvement than those who received placebo. In people with mild cognitive impairment, galantamine, compared to placebo, may make little to no difference in improving memory or the ability to do self-care activities. However, participants who received galantamine probably had a lower risk of progression to dementia after 2 years of treatment. Compared to those taking placebo, people on galantamine were three times more likely to experience gastrointestinal side effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea). The number of deaths was low, and there was no evidence that galantamine caused more deaths than placebo. Many people in the studies (ranging from 17% to 40%) stopped taking their assigned medication early, more so in the galantamine groups than the placebo groups.

5ff07b5ee7a1d23e719e421e,interactive_4,Donepezil for people with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia in older people. One approach to symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease is to enhance cholinergic neurotransmission in the brain by blocking the action of the enzyme responsible for the breakdown of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. This can be done by a group of drugs known as cholinesterase inhibitors. Donepezil is a cholinesterase inhibitor. This review is an updated version of a review first published in 1998. To assess the clinical efficacy and safety of donepezil in people with mild, moderate or severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease; to compare the efficacy and safety of different doses of donepezil; and to assess the effect of donepezil on healthcare resource use and costs. We searched Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvements Specialized Register, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and a number of other sources on 20 May 2017 to ensure that the search was as comprehensive and up-to-date as possible. In addition, we contacted members of the Donepezil Study Group and Eisai Inc. We included all double-blind, randomised controlled trials in which treatment with donepezil was administered to people with mild, moderate or severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease for 12 weeks or more and its effects compared with those of placebo in a parallel group of patients, or where two different doses of donepezil were compared. One reviewer (JSB) extracted data on cognitive function, activities of daily living, behavioural symptoms, global clinical state, quality of life, adverse events, deaths and healthcare resource costs. Where appropriate and possible, we estimated pooled treatment effects. We used GRADE methods to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome. Thirty studies involving 8257 participants met the inclusion criteria of the review, of which 28 studies reported results in sufficient detail for the meta-analyses. Most studies were of six months' duration or less. Only one small trial lasted 52 weeks. The studies tested mainly donepezil capsules at a dose of 5 mg/day or 10 mg/day. Two studies tested a slow-release oral formulation that delivered 23 mg/day. Participants in 21 studies had mild to moderate disease, in five studies moderate to severe, and in four severe disease. Seventeen studies were industry funded or sponsored, four studies were funded independently of industry and for nine studies there was no information on source of funding. Our main analysis compared the safety and efficacy of donepezil 10 mg/day with placebo at 24 to 26 weeks of treatment. Thirteen studies contributed data from 3396 participants to this analysis. Eleven of these studies were multicentre studies. Seven studies recruited patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease, two with moderate to severe, and four with severe Alzheimer's disease, with a mean age of about 75 years. Almost all evidence was of moderate quality, downgraded due to study limitations. After 26 weeks of treatment, donepezil compared with placebo was associated with better outcomes for cognitive function measured with the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-Cog, range 0 to 70) (mean difference (MD) -2.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.31 to -2.02, 1130 participants, 5 studies), the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score (MD 1.05, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.37, 1757 participants, 7 studies) and the Severe Impairment Battery (SIB, range 0 to 100) (MD 5.92, 95% CI 4.53 to 7.31, 1348 participants, 5 studies). Donepezil was also associated with better function measured with the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study activities of daily living score for severe Alzheimer's disease (ADCS-ADL-sev) (MD 1.03, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.85, 733 participants, 3 studies). A higher proportion of participants treated with donepezil experienced improvement on the clinician-rated global impression of change scale (odds ratio (OR) 1.92, 95% CI 1.54 to 2.39, 1674 participants, 6 studies). There was no difference between donepezil and placebo for behavioural symptoms measured by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) (MD -1.62, 95% CI -3.43 to 0.19, 1035 participants, 4 studies) or by the Behavioural Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease (BEHAVE-AD) scale (MD 0.4, 95% CI -1.28 to 2.08, 194 participants, 1 study). There was also no difference between donepezil and placebo for Quality of Life (QoL) (MD -2.79, 95% CI -8.15 to 2.56, 815 participants, 2 studies). Participants receiving donepezil were more likely to withdraw from the studies before the end of treatment (24% versus 20%, OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.50, 2846 participants, 12 studies) or to experience an adverse event during the studies (72% vs 65%, OR 1.59, 95% 1.31 to 1.95, 2500 participants, 10 studies). There was no evidence of a difference between donepezil and placebo for patient total healthcare resource utilisation. Three studies compared donepezil 10 mg/day to donepezil 5 mg/day over 26 weeks. The 5 mg dose was associated with slightly worse cognitive function on the ADAS-Cog, but not on the MMSE or SIB, with slightly better QoL and with fewer adverse events and withdrawals from treatment. Two studies compared donepezil 10 mg/day to donepezil 23 mg/day. There were no differences on efficacy outcomes, but fewer participants on 10 mg/day experienced adverse events or withdrew from treatment. There is moderate-quality evidence that people with mild, moderate or severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease treated for periods of 12 or 24 weeks with donepezil experience small benefits in cognitive function, activities of daily living and clinician-rated global clinical state. There is some evidence that use of donepezil is neither more nor less expensive compared with placebo when assessing total healthcare resource costs. Benefits on 23 mg/day were no greater than on 10 mg/day, and benefits on the 10 mg/day dose were marginally larger than on the 5 mg/day dose, but the rates of withdrawal and of adverse events before end of treatment were higher the higher the dose.","Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia. As the disease progresses, people lose the ability to remember, communicate, think clearly and perform the activities of daily living. Their behaviour may also change. In severe Alzheimer's disease people lose the ability to care for themselves. The most commonly used treatment for Alzheimer's disease are medicines known as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Donepezil is one of these medicines. It is taken as a pill once a day. In Alzheimer's disease, one of the changes in the brain is a reduced number of nerve cells called cholinergic neurones. These are nerve cells that signal to other cells using a chemical called acetylcholine. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as donepezil, work by preventing acetylcholine from being broken down. This may improve the symptoms of dementia. However, acetylcholine is also found elsewhere in the body and so drugs of this type may have unwanted effects. In this review we examined evidence about benefits and harms from studies that compared donepezil, taken for at least 12 weeks, to placebo (a dummy pill), or that compared different doses of donepezil. The studies had to be double-blind and randomised, that is, the decision whether people taking part got donepezil or placebo had to be made randomly and neither they nor the researchers should have known which treatment they were getting while the trial was going on. This was to make the comparison as unbiased, or fair, as possible. We searched for studies up to May 2017. We assessed the quality of all the studies we included. When it was sensible to do so, we analysed the results of studies together to get an overall result. In general, we thought that the quality of the evidence was moderate. The main factor reducing our confidence was concern that the results of some studies might have been biased by the way they were done. We cannot be sure that the results apply to treatment longer than six months. After six months of treatment, there are benefits of donepezil that are large enough to measure in studies. It is associated with side effects that are mainly mild, but that may cause people to stop treatment. Being able to stabilise cognitive performance or ability to maintain activities of daily living may be important clinically. In terms of total healthcare costs the use of donepezil appears cost neutral. However, there does not appear to be an effect on quality of life. More data are still required from longer-term clinical studies examining measures of disease progression or time to needing full time care.",1127,Alzheimer's disease; dementia; cholinergic neurotransmission; cholinesterase inhibitors; donepezil; acetylcholine,What motivations likely influenced the research focus on the efficacy and safety of donepezil in Alzheimer's treatment?,"In evaluating the effects of different doses of donepezil, what criteria were used to assess its impact?",Select all of the following that are colors,What are the potential limitations in interpreting the study's findings about donepezil's efficacy?,Judge the appropriateness of using donepezil as a treatment in patients with severe Alzheimer's disease based on study outcomes.,The prevalence of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors as a treatment for Alzheimer's.; Need to determine the cost-effectiveness of donepezil compared to other medications.; The potential for donepezil to replace all other Alzheimer's treatments.,The prevalence of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors as a treatment for Alzheimer's.; Need to determine the cost-effectiveness of donepezil compared to other medications.,Cognitive function improvements.; Comparison of behavioral changes between groups.; Differences in patient weight gain.,Cognitive function improvements.; Comparison of behavioral changes between groups.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Evidence based mainly on short-term studies.; Conflict of interest due to industry funding.; Absence of control groups in trials.,Evidence based mainly on short-term studies.; Conflict of interest due to industry funding.,Appropriate due to measurable benefits in cognitive stability.; Inappropriate due to significant adverse effects.; Inappropriate because it leads to rapid disease progression.,Appropriate due to measurable benefits in cognitive stability.
5ff07b5ee7a1d23e719e421e,interactive_4,How accurate are alternative laboratory-based molecular tests (to RT-PCR with prior RNA extraction/purification) for identifying people infected by SARS-CoV-2?,"Diagnosing people with a SARS-CoV-2 infection played a critical role in managing the COVID-19 pandemic and remains a priority for the transition to long-term management of COVID-19. Initial shortages of extraction and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) reagents impaired the desired upscaling of testing in many countries, which led to the search for alternatives to RNA extraction/purification and RT-PCR testing. Reference standard methods for diagnosing the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection rely primarily on real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Alternatives to RT-PCR could, if sufficiently accurate, have a positive impact by expanding the range of diagnostic tools available for the timely identification of people infected by SARS-CoV-2, access to testing and the use of resources. We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of alternative (to RT-PCR assays) laboratory-based molecular tests for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection. We searched the COVID-19 Open Access Project living evidence database from the University of Bern until 30 September 2020 and the WHO COVID-19 Research Database until 31 October 2022, with no language restrictions. We included studies of people with suspected or known SARS-CoV-2 infection, or where tests were used to screen for infection, and studies evaluating commercially developed laboratory-based molecular tests for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection considered as alternatives to RT-PCR testing, and we included all reference standards to define the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2, including RT-PCR tests and established clinical diagnostic criteria. Two authors independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and applicability using the QUADAS-2 tool. We presented sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals for each test using paired forest plots and summarised results using average sensitivity and specificity with a bivariate random-effects meta-analysis, illustrating the findings per index test category and assay brand compared to the WHO's acceptable sensitivity and specificity thresholds for nucleic acid tests. We included data from 64 studies reporting 94 cohorts of participants and 105 index test evaluations, with 74,753 samples and 7517 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases. We did not identify any published or preprint reports of accuracy for a considerable number of commercially produced NAAT assays. Most cohorts were judged at unclear or high risk of bias in more than three QUADAS-2 domains; around half were at high risk of selection bias because of recruitment based on COVID status; and three quarters were at high risk of bias in the reference standard domain due to reliance on a single RT-PCR result or unclear diagnostic timing, missing results, or absent participant flow diagrams. For test categories with four or more evaluations allowing summary estimates, RT-PCR assays designed to omit/adapt RNA extraction/purification had average sensitivity of 95.1% (95% CI 91.1% to 97.3%) and specificity of 99.7% (95% CI 98.5% to 99.9%; 27 evaluations, 2834 samples and 1178 cases); RT-LAMP assays had average sensitivity of 88.4% (95% CI 83.1% to 92.2%) and specificity of 99.7% (95% CI 98.7% to 99.9%; 24 evaluations, 29,496 samples and 2255 cases); TMA assays had average sensitivity of 97.6% (95% CI 95.2% to 98.8%) and specificity of 99.4% (95% CI 94.9% to 99.9%; 14 evaluations, 2196 samples and 942 cases); digital PCR assays had average sensitivity of 98.5% (95% CI 95.2% to 99.5%) and specificity of 91.4% (95% CI 60.4% to 98.7%; 5 evaluations, 703 samples and 354 cases); RT-LAMP assays omitting/adapting RNA extraction had average sensitivity of 73.1% (95% CI 58.4% to 84%) and specificity of 100% (95% CI 98% to 100%; 24 evaluations, 14,342 samples and 1502 cases). Only two index categories fulfilled WHO-acceptable requirements: RT-PCR assays designed to omit/adapt RNA extraction/purification and TMA assays. At 5% prevalence in a cohort of 1000 people, the positive predictive value of RT-PCR assays omitting/adapting extraction is 94%, with three false positives among 51 positive results and about two missed cases; for TMA assays, positive predictive value is 89%, with six false positives among 55 positive results and around one missed case. Alternative laboratory-based molecular tests aim to enhance testing capacity by reducing time, steps, and resource requirements. Several technologies with potential advantages have not been evaluated or were assessed by few low-quality studies, so performance remains undetermined. Only RT-PCR assays designed to omit/adapt RNA extraction/purification and TMA assays fulfil WHO accuracy standards and may be suitable alternatives when RT-PCR is inaccessible. However, findings must be interpreted with caution due to limitations, including reliance on retrospective samples without symptom information, dominant representation of specific high-performing brands (21/26 and 12/14 studies), and methodological weaknesses. Although we used comprehensive searches and broad inclusion criteria, further research is needed to evaluate alternative COVID-19 tests and their role in pandemic management.","Laboratory-based molecular assays (tests) aim to confirm or rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection in people. Alternatives to RT-PCR assays have been developed to minimise the steps needed to process samples in the laboratory or use fewer resources to obtain the same valid results. For this review, we focus on tests commercially developed by a manufacturer, providing instructions for their professional use. People with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection should know if they are infected to self-isolate, receive treatment, and inform close contacts. Failure to detect SARS-CoV-2 when it is present risks spreading infection and results in missed opportunities for prevention. Diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection when it is not present may lead to unnecessary self-isolation and testing of close contacts. Currently, testing to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection relies on a laboratory molecular test called RT-PCR. This requires specialist equipment and can take 24 hours to produce a result. If assays that take less time or use readily available resources were sufficiently accurate to replace RT-PCR testing, this could increase the number of tests that could be done, allow faster diagnosis and enable people to take appropriate action more quickly. We wanted to know whether commercially developed, alternative laboratory-based molecular tests are accurate enough to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to RT-PCR. We looked for studies investigating these tests in people (or samples) that were also tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection using RT-PCR which modified RT-PCR by removing or altering components of this testing process. We included 105 evaluations evaluating alternatives to RT-PCR in the review. The main results are based on 74,753 samples, and SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed in 7517 of these samples. Most evaluations (27/105) concerned various test types specifically designed to omit/adapt RNA extraction/purification. Twenty-four of 105 evaluations concerned various test types operating at one temperature (isothermal tests) rather than cycling through different temperatures. Twenty-four of 105 evaluations were concerned with various test types that combined these two alternative approaches. Only tests specifically designed to omit/adapt RNA extraction/purification and TMA assays with RNA extraction (a type of isothermal test) met WHO-acceptable standards for confirming and ruling out SARS-CoV-2. For illustration, the results of these studies indicate that in a group of 1000 people, 50 of whom (5%) actually have SARS-CoV-2: for tests specifically designed to omit/adapt RNA extraction/purification, 51 people would test positive for SARS-CoV-2, of these, three people (6%) would not have SARS-CoV-2 (false-positive result), and 949 people would test negative for SARS-CoV-2, of these, two people (0.2%) would actually have SARS-CoV-2 (false-negative result); for TMA tests with RNA extraction, 55 people would test positive for SARS-CoV-2, of these, six people (10%) would not have SARS-CoV-2 (false-positive result), and 945 people would test negative for SARS-CoV-2, of these, one person (0.1%) would actually have SARS-CoV-2 (false-negative result). Most included studies did not provide information on participants who underwent testing, such as whether they had symptoms or were close contacts of a SARS-CoV-2 case. We also had concerns about the method of recruiting participants for the majority of included studies, which may have resulted in an overestimation of the accuracy of these methods. In addition, the method used to determine whether individuals did not have SARS-CoV-2 infection was not considered reliable for most studies, which may have resulted in underestimating the accuracy of these methods. Some studies did not follow the manufacturers' instructions for using the test. Results from different test brands using the same technique varied. The studies included in this review suggest that two laboratory-based molecular tests might be accurate enough to replace or supplement RT-PCR tests with prior RNA extraction/purification for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection: RT-PCR tests developed to omit or adapt RNA extraction or purification and TMA isothermal tests (retaining an RNA extraction step). Other alternative tests to RT-PCR were assessed just by a few studies of limited methodological quality, and their performance should be evaluated by additional studies. Furthermore, data in these studies mostly relied on samples acquired in the past (compared to current or future samples), thus further evaluation of these tests in real clinical practice scenarios is required. Also, decisions on the optimal test for a specific setting will be driven not only by diagnostic accuracy, but also by other factors such as test complexity, time to result, acceptability to those being tested, and the setting in which the tests are to be used.",1112,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5ff07b5ee7a1d23e719e421e,finetuned_5,Helicobacter pylori treatment for the prevention of stomach cancer,"Gastric cancer is the third most common cause of cancer death worldwide. Individuals infected with Helicobacter pylori have a higher likelihood of developing gastric cancer than individuals who are not infected. Eradication of H. pylori in healthy asymptomatic individuals in the general population may reduce the incidence of gastric cancer, but the magnitude of this effect is unclear.
To assess the effectiveness of eradication of H. pylori in healthy asymptomatic individuals in the general population in reducing the incidence of gastric cancer.
We identified trials by searching the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2020, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1946 to February 2020), and EMBASE (1974 to February 2020). We handsearched reference lists from trials selected by electronic searching to identify further relevant trials. We handsearched published abstracts from conference proceedings from the United European Gastroenterology Week (published in Gut) and Digestive Disease Week (published in Gastroenterology) between 2001 and 2019. We contacted members of the Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Diseases Review Group and experts in the field and asked them to provide details of outstanding clinical trials and any relevant unpublished materials.
We analysed randomised controlled trials comparing at least one week of H. pylori therapy with placebo or no treatment in preventing subsequent development of gastric cancer in otherwise healthy and asymptomatic H. pylori-positive adults. Trials had to follow up participants for at least two years and needed to have at least two participants with gastric cancer as an outcome. We defined gastric cancer as any gastric adenocarcinoma, including intestinal (differentiated) or diffuse (undifferentiated) type, with or without specified histology.
We collected data on incidence of gastric cancer, incidence of oesophageal cancer, deaths from gastric cancer, deaths from any cause, and adverse effects arising due to therapy.
Six trials met all our eligibility criteria and provided extractable data in the previous version. Following our updated search, one new RCT was identified, meaning that seven trials were included in this updated review. In addition, one previously included trial provided fully published data out to 10 years, and another previously included trial provided fully published data out to 22 years of follow-up. Four trials were at low risk of bias, one trial was at unclear risk, and two trials were at high risk of bias. Six trials were conducted in Asian populations. In preventing development of subsequent gastric cancer, H. pylori eradication therapy was superior to placebo or no treatment (RR 0.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 0.72, 7 trials, 8323 participants, moderate certainty evidence). Only two trials reported the effect of eradication of H. pylori on the development of subsequent oesophageal cancer. Sixteen (0.8%) of 1947 participants assigned to eradication therapy subsequently developed oesophageal cancer compared with 13 (0.7%) of 1941 participants allocated to placebo (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.59 to 2.54, moderate certainty evidence). H. pylori eradication reduced mortality from gastric cancer compared with placebo or no treatment (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.92, 4 trials, 6301 participants, moderate certainty evidence). There was little or no evidence in all-cause mortality (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.12, 5 trials, 7079 participants, moderate certainty evidence). Adverse events data were poorly reported.
We found moderate certainty evidence that searching for and eradicating H. pylori reduces the incidence of gastric cancer and death from gastric cancer in healthy asymptomatic infected Asian individuals, but we cannot necessarily extrapolate this data to other populations.","Whether testing healthy people for Helicobacter pylori and treating those infected with a course of antibiotics decreases the number of new cases of gastric cancer. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a bacteria that lives in the lining of the stomach with people usually not aware they are carrying the infection. People with H. pylori infection are more likely to develop gastric cancer than people who are not infected with the bacterium. For this reason, H. pylori is classed as carcinogenic (causing cancer) to humans. Many people worldwide die of gastric cancer every year, because by the time those affected seek the opinion of a doctor, the condition is often advanced. However, H. pylori infection is easily treatable with a one-week course of antibiotics. A literature search up to 02 Feburary 2020 found seven trials (containing 8323 participants, four trials at low risk of bias). Six of the studies were based in Asia. We found that antibiotics for H. pylori have a small benefit in preventing gastric cancer (68 (1.6%) of 4206 participants given treatment developed gastric cancer subsequently, compared with 125 (3.0%) of 4117 given no treatment or a placebo), and in decreasing the number of deaths from gastric cancer (36 (1.1%) of 3154, compared with 59 (1.9%) of 3147); but it is unclear whether or not they increase or decrease the number of deaths due to any cause, or increase or decrease the number of cases of oesophageal cancer. Data about side effects of treatment were poorly reported. Four trials were at low risk of bias, one trial was at unclear risk, and two trials were at high risk of bias. One study was at high risk of bias because no placebo was used for the active eradication therapy regimen, and so this part of the trial was unblinded, and the other study was at high risk of bias due to inconsistencies in data reporting at the two points of follow-up. We were unable to resolve this discrepancy despite contacting the original authors. As a result, we downgraded the quality of evidence from high to moderate due to serious risk of bias.",1030,H. pylori eradication therapy; Helicobacter pylori; gastric adenocarcinoma; asymptomatic individuals; incidence of gastric cancer; oesophageal cancer; placebo; mortality from gastric cancer; adverse effects,What reasoning might explain the moderate certainty evidence regarding H. pylori eradication reducing gastric cancer incidence in the study population?,"Considering the study's findings, what might be deduced about the potential reduction in gastric cancer mortality through H. pylori eradication?",Select all of the following that are colors,What bacterium is associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer?,"In the context of the study, describe the reported benefit of using antibiotics for H. pylori.",The trials had varying levels of bias affecting the outcomes.; The population sample size was too small for adequate analysis.; The intervention period was shorter than necessary to observe long-term effects.,The trials had varying levels of bias affecting the outcomes.,Gastric cancer mortality can be significantly reduced with eradication efforts.; Gastric cancer mortality rates are unaffected by H. pylori treatment.; Mortality reduction is specific to the Asian population studied.,Gastric cancer mortality can be significantly reduced with eradication efforts.; Mortality reduction is specific to the Asian population studied.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Helicobacter pylori; Escherichia coli; Staphylococcus aureus,Helicobacter pylori,Decreases the incidence of gastric cancer; Increases overall life expectancy; Eliminates all types of cancer,Decreases the incidence of gastric cancer
5ff07b5ee7a1d23e719e421e,finetuned_6,Do education programmes improve outcomes in people with both chronic kidney disease and diabetes?,"Adherence to complex regimens for people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes is often poor. Interventions to enhance adherence require intensive education and behavioural counselling. However, whether the existing evidence is scientifically rigorous and can support recommendations for routine use of educational programmes in people with CKD and diabetes is still unknown. This is an update of a review first published in 2011.
To evaluate the benefits and harms of education programmes for people with CKD and diabetes. We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 19 July 2024 using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs investigating the benefits and harms of educational programmes (information and behavioural instructions and advice given by a healthcare provider, who could be a nurse, pharmacist, educator, health professional, medical practitioner, or healthcare provider, through verbal, written, audio-recording, or computer-aided modalities) for people 18 years and older with CKD and diabetes.
Two authors independently screened the literature, determined study eligibility, assessed quality, and extracted and entered data. We expressed dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and continuous data as mean difference (MD) with 95% CI. Data were pooled using the random-effects model. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Eight studies (13 reports, 840 randomised participants) were included. The overall risk of bias was low for objective outcomes and attrition bias, unclear for selection bias, reporting bias and other biases, and high for subjective outcomes. Education programmes compared to routine care alone probably decrease glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) (4 studies, 467 participants: MD -0.42%, 95% CI -0.53 to -0.31; moderate certainty evidence; 13.5 months follow-up) and may decrease total cholesterol (179 participants: MD -0.35 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.63 to -00.07; low certainty evidence) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (179 participants: MD -0.40 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.65 to -0.14; low certainty evidence) at 18 months of follow-up. One study (83 participants) reported education programmes for people receiving dialysis who have diabetes may improve the diabetes knowledge of diagnosis, monitoring, hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia, medication with insulin, oral medication, personal health habits, diet, exercise, chronic complications, and living with diabetes and coping with stress (all low certainty evidence). There may be an improvement in the general knowledge of diabetes at the end of the intervention and at the end of the three-month follow-up (one study, 97 participants; low certainty evidence) in people with diabetes and moderately increased albuminuria (A2). In participants with diabetes and moderately increased albuminuria (A2) (one study, 97 participants), education programmes may improve a participantÃÆÃÆÃâÃÂ¢ÃÆÃâÃâÃâ¬ÃÆÃâÃâÃâ¢s beliefs in treatment effectiveness and total self-efficacy at the end of five weeks compared to routine care (low certainty evidence). Self-efficacy for in-home blood glucose monitoring and beliefs in personal control may increase at the end of the three-month follow-up (low certainty evidence). There were no differences in other self-efficacy measures. One study (100 participants) reported an education programme may increase change in behaviour for general diet, specific diet and home blood glucose monitoring at the end of treatment (low certainty evidence); however, at the end of three months of follow-up, there may be no difference in any behaviour change outcomes (all low certainty evidence). There were uncertain effects on death, serious hypoglycaemia, and kidney failure due to very low certainty evidence. No data was available for changes in kidney function (creatinine clearance, serum creatinine, doubling of serum creatinine or proteinuria). For an education programme plus multidisciplinary, co-ordinated care compared to routine care, there may be little or no difference in HbA1c, kidney failure, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), systolic or diastolic blood pressure, hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia, and LDL and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (all low certainty evidence in participants with type-2 diabetes mellitus and documented advanced diabetic nephropathy). There were no data for death, patient-orientated measures, change in kidney function (other than eGFR and albuminuria), cardiovascular disease morbidity, quality of life, or adverse events. Education programmes may improve knowledge of some areas related to diabetes care and some self-management practices. Education programmes probably decrease HbA1c in people with CKD and diabetes, but the effect on other clinical outcomes is unclear. This review only included eight studies with small sample sizes. Therefore, more randomised studies are needed to examine the efficacy of education programmes on important clinical outcomes in people with CKD and diabetes.","Chronic kidney disease (a long-term condition where the kidneys do not work effectively) and diabetes (a lifelong condition that causes a person's blood sugar level to become too high) are chronic conditions that bring on many challenges for people, particularly when they have to manage both at the same time. Diabetes can accelerate the development of kidney disease and is the leading cause of kidney failure (a condition where the kidneys no longer function well enough to keep a person alive). While sticking to complex treatment plans can be challenging, successful self-management in the early stages of kidney disease can improve outcomes later in life and delay the need for dialysis or a kidney transplant. Education programmes are any set of planned activities designed to improve a person's ability to manage their condition and delay the progression of their kidney disease. These activities can aim to improve a person's knowledge of their disease, self-care activities, and their ability to self-monitor the disease, thus encouraging and motivating them to create healthy lifestyle changes, improve their treatment compliance, and improve quality of life. We wanted to find out whether an education programme designed for people with both kidney disease and diabetes helps them understand their condition and recognise the importance of strategies aimed at slowing its progression and preventing long-term complications. We searched for randomised studies (studies in which participants are assigned randomly to two or more treatment groups) that compared education programmes to usual care for people with both kidney disease and diabetes. We compared and summarised the results and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and sizes.
We included eight studies involving 840 people 18 years or older with both kidney disease and diabetes. Four studies were undertaken in multiple centres, and four studies were performed in single centres. The duration of follow-up ranged from 12 weeks to four years. Most of the education programmes were designed to increase a person's knowledge of their condition and improve self-management behaviours. One study focused on reducing stress using mindfulness (a person's ability to be aware of where they are and what they are doing), and it was adapted to include practices for complex thoughts and feelings related to diabetes, and one study used a co-ordinated medical care approach with multiple practitioners involved in a person's care. Overall, education programmes probably lower blood glucose levels and may lower total cholesterol and blood pressure, but may make little or no difference to kidney function, abnormally low or high blood sugar, and cardiovascular disease (disorders of the heart and blood vessels). For people with diabetes on dialysis (a procedure to remove waste products and excess fluid from the blood when the kidneys stop working properly), an education programme may improve their knowledge of diabetes, self-management behaviour for checking their feet, using lotion, wearing appropriate shoes and socks, and coping with stress. For people with moderately increased protein in the urine, there may be an improvement in their general knowledge of diabetes, their confidence in monitoring their blood sugar levels at home, their beliefs in their personal control, as well as behavioural changes to their diet. There may be no behavioural changes to exercise, foot care, or quitting smoking.
We have low confidence in education programmes improving the understanding of diabetes in people with kidney disease. This is because the number of studies reporting outcomes of interest was low, and the education programmes varied, so we were unable to properly analyse the results.",1082,Chronic kidney disease; HbA1c; Low-density lipoprotein; Moderately increased albuminuria; Education programmes; Multi-disciplinary coordinated care; Estimated glomerular filtration rate; Hyperglycaemia; Diabetic nephropathy; Self-efficacy,Which factors may influence the validity of the education programme outcomes in the study?,What criteria were used to determine the study's confidence in the evidence of educational programme outcomes?,Select all of the following that are fruits,Evaluate the potential limitations of the study's findings on education programmes.,What effect do education programmes have on self-monitoring practices?,Variability in programme design and delivery.; Limited participant age range.; Inconsistent follow-up durations.,Variability in programme design and delivery.; Inconsistent follow-up durations.,Study methods and sizes.; Geographic diversity of centres.; Participant demographics.,Study methods and sizes.,dog; blue; grape,grape,Limited number of studies and participants.; Inconsistent reporting of follow-up data.; Variety in educational programme approaches.,Limited number of studies and participants.; Variety in educational programme approaches.,They may improve confidence in home blood sugar monitoring.; They may decrease interest in self-monitoring.; They significantly improve kidney function.,They may improve confidence in home blood sugar monitoring.

GLP-1 is an incretin, a gastrointestinal hormone that is released into the circulation in response to ingested nutrients. GLP-1 regulates glucose levels by stimulating glucose-dependent insulin secretion and biosynthesis, and by suppressing glucagon secretion, delayed gastric emptying and promoting satiety.
To assess the effects of glucagon-like peptide analogues in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Studies were obtained from electronic searches of The Cochrane Library (last search issue 1, 2011), MEDLINE (last search March 2011), EMBASE (last search March 2011), Web of Science (last search March 2011) and databases of ongoing trials.
Studies were included if they were randomised controlled trials of a minimum duration of eight weeks comparing a GLP-1 analogue with placebo, insulin, an oral anti-diabetic agent, or another GLP-1 analogue in people with type 2 diabetes.
Data extraction and quality assessment of studies were done by one reviewer and checked by a second. Data were analysed by type of GLP-1 agonist and comparison treatment. Where appropriate, data were summarised in a meta-analysis (mean differences and risk ratios summarised using a random-effects model).
Seventeen randomised controlled trials including relevant analyses for 6899 participants were included in the analysis. Studies were mostly of short duration, usually 26 weeks. In comparison with placebo, all GLP-1 agonists reduced glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels by about 1%. Exenatide 2 mg once weekly and liraglutide 1.8 mg reduced it by 0.20% and 0.24% respectively more than insulin glargine. Exenatide 2 mg once weekly reduced HbA1c more than exenatide 10 ?g twice daily, sitagliptin and pioglitazone. Liraglutide 1.8 mg reduced HbA1c by 0.33% more than exenatide 10 ?g twice daily. Liraglutide led to similar improvements in HbA1c compared to sulphonylureas but reduced it more than sitagliptin and rosiglitazone. Both exenatide and liraglutide led to greater weight loss than most active comparators, including in participants not experiencing nausea. Hypoglycaemia occurred more frequently in participants taking concomitant sulphonylurea. GLP-1 agonists caused gastrointestinal adverse effects, mainly nausea. These adverse events were strongest at the beginning and then subsided. Beta-cell function was improved with GLP-1 agonists but the effect did not persist after cessation of treatment. None of the studies was long enough to assess long-term positive or negative effects.
GLP-1 agonists are effective in improving glycaemic control.","Glucagon-like peptide analogues or agonists are a new kind of drug in the treatment of type 2 diabetes that are given by injection under the skin. They regulate glucose levels by stimulating glucose-dependent insulin secretion and biosynthesis, and by suppressing glucagon secretion, delaying gastric emptying and promoting satiety. Various glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists are in use or in the licensing process, including exenatide, liraglutide, albiglutide, taspoglutide, lixisenatide and LY2189265.
Seventeen randomised controlled trials of mostly moderate to high quality randomised approximately 6899 people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Studies were mostly of short duration, usually 26 weeks. The longest duration study was 30 weeks. Of the seventeen studies, one compared albiglutide with placebo, two compared exenatide 10µg twice daily against exenatide 2 mg once weekly, one compared exenatide 2 mg once weekly against insulin glargine, one compared exenatide 2 mg once weekly against pioglitazone and sitagliptin, five compared liraglutide with placebo, two compared liraglutide with sulphonylurea, one each compared exenatide twice daily with liraglutide, liraglutide with sitagliptin, liraglutide with rosiglitazone and liraglutide with insulin glargine, two compared taspoglutide with placebo and one each compared lixisenatide with placebo and LY2189265 with placebo. In people already treated with oral anti-diabetes drugs, addition of glucagon-like peptide analogues improved blood sugar control in comparison to placebo, rosiglitazone, pioglitazone or sitagliptin, but not always in comparison to insulin (for exenatide) or glimepiride (a sulphonylurea). Glucagon-like peptide analogous caused more weight loss than any of the comparison treatments. However, more nausea and other gastrointestinal effects such as diarrhoea or vomiting were seen, though these tended to wear off and were not seen in all participants. There was slightly more hypoglycaemia with glucagon-like analogous than with placebo, but generally less than with other anti-diabetic treatments. The incidence of hypoglycaemia occurred more frequently in participants taking concomitant sulphonylurea. The studies were not long enough to assess long-term side effects. None of the studies investigated mortality or morbidity.",1006,"Glucagon-like peptide analogues, type 2 diabetes mellitus, glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), exenatide, liraglutide, insulin glargine, hypoglycaemia, gastrointestinal adverse effects, beta-cell function, sulphonylureas",What key factors led the researchers to choose glucagon-like peptide analogues as a focus for treating type 2 diabetes?,How do the results of GLP-1 agonists in comparison to placebo impact future diabetes treatment plans?,Select all of the following that are fruits,Which findings regarding side effects would most likely influence the long-term use of GLP-1 agonists?,What is the primary purpose of glucagon-like peptide analogues in the treatment of type 2 diabetes?,Their mechanism of stimulating glucose-dependent insulin secretion and suppressing glucagon secretion.; Their ability to replace insulin completely in diabetes management.; Their unique pathway of promoting satiety and delaying gastric emptying.,Their mechanism of stimulating glucose-dependent insulin secretion and suppressing glucagon secretion.; Their unique pathway of promoting satiety and delaying gastric emptying.,They ensure GLP-1 agonists will replace all other anti-diabetic medications.; They provide evidence supporting the inclusion of GLP-1 agonists in treatment regimens where weight loss is beneficial.; They suggest GLP-1 agonists are ineffective when used with placebo.,They provide evidence supporting the inclusion of GLP-1 agonists in treatment regimens where weight loss is beneficial.,dog; blue; grape,grape,The persistence of gastrointestinal effects like nausea and diarrhea.; The decrease in hypoglycemic events compared to sulphonylureas.; The studies' failure to address long-term side effects.,The decrease in hypoglycemic events compared to sulphonylureas.; The studies' failure to address long-term side effects.,To reduce blood glucose levels; To replace insulin therapy completely; To increase glucagon secretion,To reduce blood glucose levels
66231fc6e1ecba676935943a,static_1,Cannabis-based medicines for cancer pain,"Pain is a common symptom in people with cancer; 30% to 50% of people with cancer will experience moderate-to-severe pain. This can have a major negative impact on their quality of life. Opioid (morphine-like) medications are commonly used to treat moderate or severe cancer pain, and are recommended for this purpose in the World Health Organization (WHO) pain treatment ladder. Pain is not sufficiently relieved by opioid medications in 10% to 15% of people with cancer. In people with insufficient relief of cancer pain, new analgesics are needed to effectively and safely supplement or replace opioids. To evaluate the benefits and harms of cannabis-based medicines, including medical cannabis, for treating pain and other symptoms in adults with cancer compared to placebo or any other established analgesic for cancer pain. We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 26 January 2023. We selected double-blind randomised, controlled trials (RCT) of medical cannabis, plant-derived and synthetic cannabis-based medicines against placebo or any other active treatment for cancer pain in adults, with any treatment duration and at least 10 participants per treatment arm. We used standard Cochrane methods. The primary outcomes were 1. proportions of participants reporting no worse than mild pain; 2. Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) of much improved or very much improved and 3. withdrawals due to adverse events. Secondary outcomes were 4. number of participants who reported pain relief of 30% or greater and overall opioid use reduced or stable; 5. number of participants who reported pain relief of 30% or greater, or 50% or greater; 6. pain intensity; 7. sleep problems; 8. depression and anxiety; 9. daily maintenance and breakthrough opioid dosage; 10. dropouts due to lack of efficacy; 11. all central nervous system adverse events. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence for each outcome. We identified 14 studies involving 1823 participants. No study assessed the proportions of participants reporting no worse than mild pain on treatment by 14 days after start of treatment. We found five RCTs assessing oromucosal nabiximols (tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD)) or THC alone involving 1539 participants with moderate or severe pain despite opioid therapy. The double-blind periods of the RCTs ranged between two and five weeks. Four studies with a parallel design and 1333 participants were available for meta-analysis. There was moderate-certainty evidence that there was no clinically relevant benefit for proportions of PGIC much or very much improved (risk difference (RD) 0.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 0.12; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 16, 95% CI 8 to 100). There was moderate-certainty evidence for no clinically relevant difference in the proportion of withdrawals due to adverse events (RD 0.04, 95% CI 0 to 0.08; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 25, 95% CI 16 to endless). There was moderate-certainty evidence for no difference between nabiximols or THC and placebo in the frequency of serious adverse events (RD 0.02, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.07). There was moderate-certainty evidence that nabiximols and THC used as add-on treatment for opioid-refractory cancer pain did not differ from placebo in reducing mean pain intensity (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.19, 95% CI -0.40 to 0.02). There was low-certainty evidence that a synthetic THC analogue (nabilone) delivered over eight weeks was not superior to placebo in reducing pain associated with chemotherapy or radiochemotherapy in people with head and neck cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (2 studies, 89 participants, qualitative analysis). Analyses of tolerability and safety were not possible for these studies. There was low-certainty evidence that synthetic THC analogues were superior to placebo (SMD -0.98, 95% CI -1.36 to -0.60), but not superior to low-dose codeine (SMD 0.03, 95% CI -0.25 to 0.32; 5 single-dose trials; 126 participants) in reducing moderate-to-severe cancer pain after cessation of previous analgesic treatment for three to four and a half hours (2 single-dose trials; 66 participants). Analyses of tolerability and safety were not possible for these studies. There was low-certainty evidence that CBD oil did not add value to specialist palliative care alone in the reduction of pain intensity in people with advanced cancer. There was no difference in the number of dropouts due to adverse events and serious adverse events (1 study, 144 participants, qualitative analysis). We found no studies using herbal cannabis. There is moderate-certainty evidence that oromucosal nabiximols and THC are ineffective in relieving moderate-to-severe opioid-refractory cancer pain. There is low-certainty evidence that nabilone is ineffective in reducing pain associated with (radio-) chemotherapy in people with head and neck cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. There is low-certainty evidence that a single dose of synthetic THC analogues is not superior to a single low-dose morphine equivalent in reducing moderate-to-severe cancer pain. There is low-certainty evidence that CBD does not add value to specialist palliative care alone in the reduction of pain in people with advanced cancer.","One person in two or three who gets cancer will have pain that becomes moderate or severe in intensity. The pain tends to get worse as the cancer progresses.
The WHO recommends taking morphine-like medicines for moderate-to-severe pain from cancer, but 1 in 6 to 10 people with cancer pain do not experience sufficient pain relief from morphine-like medicines. Several products based on the cannabis plant have been suggested as treatment for cancer pain. These products include inhaled or orally ingested herbal cannabis, and various oils, sprays or tablets containing active cannabis ingredients obtained from the plant, or made synthetically. Some people with cancer pain have reported that CbMs are effective for them, and that is often highlighted in the media.
If CbMs relieved cancer pain in people living with cancer.
If CbMs were associated with any unwanted or harmful effects.
We searched for clinical trials that examined CbMs compared to other medications to treat cancer pain in adults.
We summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as the methods and size of studies.
We found 14 studies involving 1823 people. The biggest study included 399 people and the smallest study included 10 people.
Studies were conducted in countries around the world; most (six) were based in North America.
Five studies used one dose of CbM and lasted less than one day. Other studies lasted between two and eight weeks.
Pharmaceutical companies funded seven studies.
Six studies compared a mouth spray with a plant-derived combination of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the principal psychoactive constituent of cannabis, and cannabidiol (CBD), an anti-inflammatory ingredient of cannabis, against a fake medication (placebo). Seven studies compared an artificial cannabinoid mimicking the effects of THC against placebo. Of these seven studies, two studies compared against a morphine-like medication (codeine), too. One study compared CBD against placebo.
We did not find studies with herbal cannabis.
Mouth spray with a plant-derived combination of THC and CBD was probably not better than placebo in reducing pain in people with moderate-to-severe cancer pain despite opioid treatment. Thirty-two out of 100 people reported to be much or very much improved by cannabis-based mouth spray and 23 out of 100 people with mouth spray with placebo. A total of 19 out of 100 people withdrew early because of side effects by cannabis-based mouth spray and 16 out of 100 people by mouth spray with placebo. There was no difference in serious side effects between the cannabis-based mouth spray and a placebo mouth spray.
Artificial cannabinoid mimicking the effects of THC may not be better than a fake medication in reducing pain associated with chemotherapy or radiochemotherapy in people with head and neck cancer and a certain type of lung cancer.
A single dose of an artificial cannabinoid mimicking the effects of THC may be better than a single dose of placebo, but may not differ from a single small dose of a morphine-like medication in reducing moderate-to-severe cancer pain after cessation of previous analgesic treatment for three to four and a half hours.
CBD may not add value to specialist palliative care alone in the reduction of pain in people with advanced cancer.
We found no studies with medical cannabis.
We are moderately confident in the evidence that a mouth spray with a plant-derived combination of THC and CBD does not reduce severe cancer pain despite opioid treatment because studies did not provide information about everything that we could have used.
We have little confidence in the evidence that an artificial cannabinoid mimicking the effects of THC (nabilone) does not reduce pain associated with chemotherapy or radiochemotherapy because the studies did not provide data about everything that we could have used, and because the studies were small.
We have little confidence in the evidence that artificial cannabinoids mimicking the effects of THC reduce cancer pain after the previous pain-relieving medication was stopped some hours before because the studies did not provide data about everything that we could have used, and because the studies were small.
We have little confidence in the evidence that CBD added to standard palliative care does not reduce cancer pain because there was only one study available.",1016,Opioid-refractory; oromucosal nabiximols; tetrahydrocannabinol (THC); cannabidiol (CBD); patient global impression of change (PGIC); synthetic THC analogue; analgesic treatment; chemotherapy; radiochemotherapy; adverse events,How do the study results challenge the potential use of cannabis-based medicines as alternatives to opioids for cancer pain?,What was a key motivation for the study?,Select all of the following that are colors,What was the outcome of using a mouth spray with THC and CBD for cancer pain?,"In the study, how did artificial cannabinoids perform compared to codeine?",There is no strong evidence that CbMs offer superior pain relief to opioids.; CbMs consistently showed better results than placebo.; CbMs treatments are associated with fewer side effects than opioids.,There is no strong evidence that CbMs offer superior pain relief to opioids.,To determine the effectiveness of CbMs in cancer pain relief.; To find new synthetic drugs for cancer treatment.; To evaluate the cost of cancer treatments.,To determine the effectiveness of CbMs in cancer pain relief.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,It was more effective than placebo.; It did not show significant improvement over placebo.; It cured the pain completely.,It did not show significant improvement over placebo.,They were superior in reducing pain.; They showed no difference in pain reduction.; They were less effective than codeine.,They showed no difference in pain reduction.
66231fc6e1ecba676935943a,static_2,How accurate are alternative laboratory-based molecular tests (to RT-PCR with prior RNA extraction/purification) for identifying people infected by SARS-CoV-2?,"Diagnosing people with a SARS-CoV-2 infection played a critical role in managing the COVID-19 pandemic and remains a priority for the transition to long-term management of COVID-19. Initial shortages of extraction and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) reagents impaired the desired upscaling of testing in many countries, which led to the search for alternatives to RNA extraction/purification and RT-PCR testing. Reference standard methods for diagnosing the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection rely primarily on real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Alternatives to RT-PCR could, if sufficiently accurate, have a positive impact by expanding the range of diagnostic tools available for the timely identification of people infected by SARS-CoV-2, access to testing and the use of resources. We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of alternative (to RT-PCR assays) laboratory-based molecular tests for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection. We searched the COVID-19 Open Access Project living evidence database from the University of Bern until 30 September 2020 and the WHO COVID-19 Research Database until 31 October 2022, with no language restrictions. We included studies of people with suspected or known SARS-CoV-2 infection, or where tests were used to screen for infection, and studies evaluating commercially developed laboratory-based molecular tests for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection considered as alternatives to RT-PCR testing, and we included all reference standards to define the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2, including RT-PCR tests and established clinical diagnostic criteria. Two authors independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and applicability using the QUADAS-2 tool. We presented sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals for each test using paired forest plots and summarised results using average sensitivity and specificity with a bivariate random-effects meta-analysis, illustrating the findings per index test category and assay brand compared to the WHO's acceptable sensitivity and specificity thresholds for nucleic acid tests. We included data from 64 studies reporting 94 cohorts of participants and 105 index test evaluations, with 74,753 samples and 7517 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases. We did not identify any published or preprint reports of accuracy for a considerable number of commercially produced NAAT assays. Most cohorts were judged at unclear or high risk of bias in more than three QUADAS-2 domains; around half were at high risk of selection bias because of recruitment based on COVID status; and three quarters were at high risk of bias in the reference standard domain due to reliance on a single RT-PCR result or unclear diagnostic timing, missing results, or absent participant flow diagrams. For test categories with four or more evaluations allowing summary estimates, RT-PCR assays designed to omit/adapt RNA extraction/purification had average sensitivity of 95.1% (95% CI 91.1% to 97.3%) and specificity of 99.7% (95% CI 98.5% to 99.9%; 27 evaluations, 2834 samples and 1178 cases); RT-LAMP assays had average sensitivity of 88.4% (95% CI 83.1% to 92.2%) and specificity of 99.7% (95% CI 98.7% to 99.9%; 24 evaluations, 29,496 samples and 2255 cases); TMA assays had average sensitivity of 97.6% (95% CI 95.2% to 98.8%) and specificity of 99.4% (95% CI 94.9% to 99.9%; 14 evaluations, 2196 samples and 942 cases); digital PCR assays had average sensitivity of 98.5% (95% CI 95.2% to 99.5%) and specificity of 91.4% (95% CI 60.4% to 98.7%; 5 evaluations, 703 samples and 354 cases); RT-LAMP assays omitting/adapting RNA extraction had average sensitivity of 73.1% (95% CI 58.4% to 84%) and specificity of 100% (95% CI 98% to 100%; 24 evaluations, 14,342 samples and 1502 cases). Only two index categories fulfilled WHO-acceptable requirements: RT-PCR assays designed to omit/adapt RNA extraction/purification and TMA assays. At 5% prevalence in a cohort of 1000 people, the positive predictive value of RT-PCR assays omitting/adapting extraction is 94%, with three false positives among 51 positive results and about two missed cases; for TMA assays, positive predictive value is 89%, with six false positives among 55 positive results and around one missed case. Alternative laboratory-based molecular tests aim to enhance testing capacity by reducing time, steps, and resource requirements. Several technologies with potential advantages have not been evaluated or were assessed by few low-quality studies, so performance remains undetermined. Only RT-PCR assays designed to omit/adapt RNA extraction/purification and TMA assays fulfil WHO accuracy standards and may be suitable alternatives when RT-PCR is inaccessible. However, findings must be interpreted with caution due to limitations, including reliance on retrospective samples without symptom information, dominant representation of specific high-performing brands (21/26 and 12/14 studies), and methodological weaknesses. Although we used comprehensive searches and broad inclusion criteria, further research is needed to evaluate alternative COVID-19 tests and their role in pandemic management.","Laboratory-based molecular assays (tests) aim to confirm or rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection in people. Alternatives to RT-PCR assays have been developed to minimise the steps needed to process samples in the laboratory or use fewer resources to obtain the same valid results. For this review, we focus on tests commercially developed by a manufacturer, providing instructions for their professional use. People with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection should know if they are infected to self-isolate, receive treatment, and inform close contacts. Failure to detect SARS-CoV-2 when it is present risks spreading infection and results in missed opportunities for prevention. Diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection when it is not present may lead to unnecessary self-isolation and testing of close contacts. Currently, testing to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection relies on a laboratory molecular test called RT-PCR. This requires specialist equipment and can take 24 hours to produce a result. If assays that take less time or use readily available resources were sufficiently accurate to replace RT-PCR testing, this could increase the number of tests that could be done, allow faster diagnosis and enable people to take appropriate action more quickly. We wanted to know whether commercially developed, alternative laboratory-based molecular tests are accurate enough to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to RT-PCR. We looked for studies investigating these tests in people (or samples) that were also tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection using RT-PCR which modified RT-PCR by removing or altering components of this testing process. We included 105 evaluations evaluating alternatives to RT-PCR in the review. The main results are based on 74,753 samples, and SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed in 7517 of these samples. Most evaluations (27/105) concerned various test types specifically designed to omit/adapt RNA extraction/purification. Twenty-four of 105 evaluations concerned various test types operating at one temperature (isothermal tests) rather than cycling through different temperatures. Twenty-four of 105 evaluations were concerned with various test types that combined these two alternative approaches. Only tests specifically designed to omit/adapt RNA extraction/purification and TMA assays with RNA extraction (a type of isothermal test) met WHO-acceptable standards for confirming and ruling out SARS-CoV-2. For illustration, the results of these studies indicate that in a group of 1000 people, 50 of whom (5%) actually have SARS-CoV-2: for tests specifically designed to omit/adapt RNA extraction/purification, 51 people would test positive for SARS-CoV-2, of these, three people (6%) would not have SARS-CoV-2 (false-positive result), and 949 people would test negative for SARS-CoV-2, of these, two people (0.2%) would actually have SARS-CoV-2 (false-negative result); for TMA tests with RNA extraction, 55 people would test positive for SARS-CoV-2, of these, six people (10%) would not have SARS-CoV-2 (false-positive result), and 945 people would test negative for SARS-CoV-2, of these, one person (0.1%) would actually have SARS-CoV-2 (false-negative result). Most included studies did not provide information on participants who underwent testing, such as whether they had symptoms or were close contacts of a SARS-CoV-2 case. We also had concerns about the method of recruiting participants for the majority of included studies, which may have resulted in an overestimation of the accuracy of these methods. In addition, the method used to determine whether individuals did not have SARS-CoV-2 infection was not considered reliable for most studies, which may have resulted in underestimating the accuracy of these methods. Some studies did not follow the manufacturers' instructions for using the test. Results from different test brands using the same technique varied. The studies included in this review suggest that two laboratory-based molecular tests might be accurate enough to replace or supplement RT-PCR tests with prior RNA extraction/purification for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection: RT-PCR tests developed to omit or adapt RNA extraction or purification and TMA isothermal tests (retaining an RNA extraction step). Other alternative tests to RT-PCR were assessed just by a few studies of limited methodological quality, and their performance should be evaluated by additional studies. Furthermore, data in these studies mostly relied on samples acquired in the past (compared to current or future samples), thus further evaluation of these tests in real clinical practice scenarios is required. Also, decisions on the optimal test for a specific setting will be driven not only by diagnostic accuracy, but also by other factors such as test complexity, time to result, acceptability to those being tested, and the setting in which the tests are to be used.",1112,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
66231fc6e1ecba676935943a,static_2,Melatonin and agomelatine for prevention of winter depression,"Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a seasonal pattern of recurrent major depressive episodes that most commonly starts in autumn or winter and remits in spring. The prevalence of SAD depends on latitude and ranges from 1.5% to 9%. The predictable seasonal aspect of SAD provides a promising opportunity for prevention in people who have a history of SAD. This is one of four reviews on the efficacy and safety of interventions to prevent SAD; we focus on agomelatine and melatonin as preventive interventions. To assess the efficacy and safety of agomelatine and melatonin (in comparison with each other, placebo, second-generation antidepressants, light therapy, psychological therapy or lifestyle interventions) in preventing SAD and improving person-centred outcomes among adults with a history of SAD. We searched Ovid MEDLINE (1950- ), Embase (1974- ), PsycINFO (1967- ) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to 19 June 2018. An earlier search of these databases was conducted via the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trial Register (CCMD-CTR) (all years to 11 August 2015). Furthermore, we searched the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database and international trial registers (to 19 June 2018). We also conducted a grey literature search and handsearched the reference lists of included studies and pertinent review articles. To examine efficacy, we included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on adults with a history of winter-type SAD who were free of symptoms at the beginning of the study. For adverse events, we intended also to include non-randomised studies. We planned to include studies that compared agomelatine versus melatonin, or agomelatine or melatonin versus placebo, any second-generation antidepressant, light therapy, psychological therapies or lifestyle changes. We also intended to compare melatonin or agomelatine in combination with any of the comparator interventions mentioned above versus the same comparator intervention as monotherapy.
Two review authors screened abstracts and full-text publications, abstracted data and assessed risk of bias of included studies independently. We intended to pool data in a meta-analysis using a random-effects model, but included only one study. We identified 3745 citations through electronic searches and reviews of reference lists after deduplication of search results. We excluded 3619 records during title and abstract review and assessed 126 full-text papers for inclusion in the review. Only one study, providing data of 225 participants, met our eligibility criteria and compared agomelatine (25 mg/day) with placebo. We rated it as having high risk of attrition bias because nearly half of the participants left the study before completion. We rated the certainty of the evidence as very low for all outcomes, because of high risk of bias, indirectness, and imprecision. The main analysis based on data of 199 participants rendered an indeterminate result with wide confidence intervals (CIs) that may encompass both a relevant reduction as well as a relevant increase of SAD incidence by agomelatine (risk ratio (RR) 0.83, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.34; 199 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Also the severity of SAD may be similar in both groups at the end of the study with a mean SIGH-SAD (Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Seasonal Affective Disorders) score of 8.3 (standard deviation (SD) 9.4) in the agomelatine group and 10.1 (SD 10.6) in the placebo group (mean difference (MD) -1.80, 95% CI -4.58 to 0.98; 199 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events may be similar in both groups. In the agomelatine group, 64 out of 112 participants experienced at least one adverse event, while 61 out of 113 did in the placebo group (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.34; 225 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Three out of 112 patients experienced serious adverse events in the agomelatine group, compared to 4 out of 113 in the placebo group (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.17 to 3.30; 225 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No data on quality of life or interpersonal functioning were reported. We did not identify any studies on melatonin.
Given the uncertain evidence on agomelatine and the absence of studies on melatonin, no conclusion about efficacy and safety of agomelatine and melatonin for prevention of SAD can currently be drawn. The decision for or against initiating preventive treatment of SAD and the treatment selected should consider patient preferences and reflect on the evidence base of all available treatment options.","Many people in northern latitudes suffer from seasonal affective disorder (SAD), which occurs as a reaction to reduced sunlight. Three-quarters of those affected are women. Lethargy, overeating, craving for carbohydrates and depressed mood are common symptoms. In some people, SAD becomes depression that seriously affects their daily lives. Up to two-thirds experience depressive symptoms every winter. General practitioners, psychiatrists, pharmacists, other health professionals working in adult mental health services, and researchers could be interested in the results of this review. Anyone who has experienced winter depression, or who has friends or relatives who have experienced winter depression might also be interested. Because of the seasonal pattern and high recurrence of SAD, melatonin or agomelatine could be used to prevent the onset of depressed mood. The goal of this report is to examine whether benefits outweigh harms of melatonin or agomelatine when used to prevent onset of a new depressive episode in people with a history of SAD who were free of symptoms when the preventive intervention started. To date, this question has not been examined in a systematic way. This is one of four reviews on the efficacy and potential harms of interventions to prevent SAD. We searched databases up to June 2018 for studies on melatonin or agomelatine for prevention of winter depression. Among 3745 records, we found one randomised controlled study comparing agomelatine with placebo for one year. All 225 participants had a history of winter depression but were not depressed when the prevention study started. The included study showed neither a clear effect in favour nor against agomelatine as a preventive treatment. In addition, the certainty of evidence for all outcomes was very low, making it impossible to draw any conclusions about the efficacy and safety of agomelatine for the prevention of winter depression. No evidence on melatonin for prevention of SAD was identified. Doctors need to discuss with persons with a history of SAD that currently evidence on agomelatine or melatonin for preventive treatment options for SAD is inconclusive, therefore treatment selection should be strongly based on peoples' preferences and reflect on the evidence base of all available treatment options. Review authors recommend that future studies should evaluate the efficacy of agomelatine or melatonin in preventing SAD and should directly compare these interventions against other treatment options, such as light therapy, antidepressants, or psychological therapies to determine the best treatment option for prevention of SAD.",1121,Seasonal affective disorder; major depressive episodes; agomelatine; melatonin; light therapy; psychological therapy; lifestyle interventions,How do the motivations for investigating agomelatine and melatonin for SAD prevention reflect the challenges faced by northern populations?,How can the findings from this review be integrated into future studies for a more definitive conclusion on the use of agomelatine?,Select all of the following that are colors,"Based on the review, what criteria should healthcare providers consider when discussing treatment options for SAD with patients?",How does the report suggest assessing treatment options for SAD prevention?,The seasonal variation in sunlight uniquely affects mental health in these regions.; The general practitioners in these regions prefer these medications.; There is a cultural significance to using these treatments in northern latitudes.,The seasonal variation in sunlight uniquely affects mental health in these regions.,Design studies that directly compare agomelatine with other established treatments.; Limit research to uncontrolled observational studies.; Focus solely on patient preference surveys in future studies.,Design studies that directly compare agomelatine with other established treatments.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Evidence base and patient preferences.; Brand reputation of agomelatine and melatonin.; Cost of treatment as the primary factor.,Evidence base and patient preferences.,Based on patient preferences; Random selection; Popularity of the treatment,Based on patient preferences

Questions regarding the efficacy and safety of  non?vitamin  K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) after TAVR still need to be definitively answered.
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of NOACs after TAVR in individuals with and without indication for anticoagulation.
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP on 7 October 2023 together with reference checking and citation searching to identify additional studies.
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared NOACs versus antiplatelet therapy or vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) after TAVR in adults with or without an indication for anticoagulation.
We used standard Cochrane methods and conducted random-effects pair-wise analyses and network meta-analyses (NMAs). Our primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, stroke, and major bleeding. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence.
We included four RCTs with 4808 participants in the NMA. Of these, one compared rivaroxaban versus antiplatelet therapy in people without an indication for anticoagulation after TAVR; one compared apixaban versus antiplatelet therapy in people without an indication for anticoagulation or versus VKA in people with an indication for anticoagulation after TAVR; one compared edoxaban versus VKA in people with an indication for anticoagulation after TAVR; and one compared edoxaban with antiplatelet therapy in people without an indication for anticoagulation after TAVR. The mean age of trial participants was 81 years. Follow-up duration ranged from 6 to 18 months. Overall, we judged the risk of bias in the included trials to be low in all domains except for blinding, which was assessed as high in all four studies. No studies evaluated dabigatran. In peoplewithoutan indication for anticoagulation, rivaroxaban and apixaban may increase all-cause mortality after TAVR as compared to antiplatelet therapy (rivaroxaban: risk ratio (RR) 1.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13 to 2.46; studies = 1, participants = 1644; moderate-certainty evidence; apixaban: RR 1.71, 95% CI 0.97 to 3.02; studies = 1, participants = 1049; low-certainty evidence), while edoxaban may result in little or no difference (RR 1.59, 95% CI 0.27 to 9.36; studies = 1, participants = 229; low-certainty evidence). Low-certainty evidence suggests little or no difference between rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban and antiplatelet therapy in cardiovascular mortality (rivaroxaban: RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.10; studies = 1, participants = 1644; apixaban: RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.64 to 2.65; studies = 1, participants = 1049; edoxaban: RR 7.44, 95% CI 0.39 to 142.38; studies = 1, participants = 229) and between rivaroxaban or edoxaban and antiplatelets in stroke (rivaroxaban: RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.71 to 2.00; studies = 1, participants = 1644; edoxaban: RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.15 to 7.42; studies = 1, participants = 229). While rivaroxaban versus antiplatelets probably increases major bleeding after TAVR (RR 1.98, 95% CI 1.07 to 3.65; studies = 1, participants = 1644; moderate-certainty evidence), there may be little or no difference between apixaban and antiplatelet therapy (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.64; studies = 1, participants = 1049; low-certainty evidence). It is unclear if edoxaban has an effect on major bleeding, although the point estimate suggests increased bleeding (versus antiplatelets: RR 2.13, 95% CI 0.54 to 8.30; studies = 1, participants = 229; low-certainty evidence). In peoplewithan indication for anticoagulation, low-certainty evidence suggests apixaban or edoxaban may result in little to no difference in our predefined primary efficacy outcomes after TAVR when compared to VKA (all-cause mortality: apixaban: RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.77; studies = 1, participants = 451; edoxaban: RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.20; studies = 1, participants = 1426; cardiovascular mortality: apixaban: RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.76 to 2.70; studies = 1, participants = 451; edoxaban: RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.57; studies = 1, participants = 1426; stroke: apixaban: RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.35 to 4.70; studies = 1, participants = 451; edoxaban: RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.34; studies = 1, participants = 1426). While apixaban may result in a similar rate of bleeding as VKA in this population, edoxaban probably increases major bleeding after TAVR in people with an indication for anticoagulation (apixaban: RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.54; studies = 1, participants = 451; low-certainty evidence; edoxaban: RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.93; studies = 1, participants = 1426; moderate-certainty evidence).
In peoplewithoutan indication for oral anticoagulation, rivaroxaban and apixaban may increase all-cause mortality when compared to antiplatelet therapy, while edoxaban may result in little or no difference. There might be little or no difference between rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban and antiplatelet therapy in cardiovascular mortality, and between rivaroxaban or edoxaban and antiplatelets in stroke. While rivaroxaban probably increases major bleeding following TAVR, there might be little or no difference between apixaban and antiplatelet therapy, and the effect of edoxaban on major bleeding remains unclear. In peoplewithan indication for anticoagulation, apixaban and edoxaban may be as effective as VKA in preventing all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death, and stroke. Apixaban may lead to a similar rate of major bleeding as VKA in this population. However, edoxaban probably increases major bleeding following TAVR when compared to VKA. Our NMA did not show superiority of one NOAC over another for any of the primary outcomes. Head-to-head trials directly comparing NOACs against each other are required to increase the certainty of the evidence.","TAVR is a heart valve replacement procedure that does not require open-heart surgery. It uses a heart catheter to insert a new valve through a small surgical incision in the leg or chest. Choosing the best treatment for people after TAVR remains a challenge in clinical practice.
We looked at whether the next-generation blood thinners, non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs), are safer and more effective than antiplatelet drugs or vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), such as warfarin, after TAVR.
We searched for studies that looked at the benefits and harms of NOACs compared with antiplatelet therapy or VKA after TAVR.
We found five studies that compared three types of NOACs: rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, with antiplatelet drugs or warfarin, one of which is ongoing. Our review findings are based on the four completed studies involving 4808 participants.
We found that in people who did not have a medical reason to take blood thinners, the NOACs rivaroxaban and apixaban may increase the risk of death for any reason compared to antiplatelet therapy, while edoxaban appears to have little or no effect. Any differences between rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban, and antiplatelet therapy in death caused by diseases of the heart or blood vessels are likely small. Similarly, differences between rivaroxaban or edoxaban and antiplatelets in stroke are also likely small. In these people, the risk of serious bleeding is probably increased with rivaroxaban; however, there seems to be little or no difference between apixaban and antiplatelet therapy, and we are uncertain about the impact of edoxaban on serious bleeding.
In people who have a medical reason to take blood thinners, we found that apixaban and edoxaban may be as effective as warfarin in preventing death for any reason, death caused by diseases of the heart or blood vessels, and stroke. Apixaban may result in a similar rate of serious bleeding as warfarin, whereas edoxaban probably increases the rate of serious bleeding compared to warfarin.
We are uncertain if any one type of NOAC is better than another. More research is needed to know for sure.
We have little confidence in the evidence for apixaban and edoxaban because the included studies were small. We are only moderately confident in some of the evidence for rivaroxaban, also due to the small size of studies.

66231fc6e1ecba676935943a,interactive_4,Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation for adults after heart valve surgery,"The impact of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) following heart valve surgery is uncertain. We conducted an update of this systematic review and a meta-analysis to assess randomised controlled trial evidence for the use of exercise-based CR following heart valve surgery. To assess the benefits and harms of exercise-based CR compared with no exercise training in adults following heart valve surgery or repair, including both percutaneous and surgical procedures, we considered CR programmes consisting of exercise training with or without another intervention (such as an intervention with a psycho-educational component). We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials (CENTRAL), in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE (Ovid); Embase (Ovid); the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; EBSCO); PsycINFO (Ovid); Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS; Bireme); and Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science (CPCI-S) on the Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics) on 10 January 2020. We searched for ongoing trials from ClinicalTrials.gov, Clinical-trials.com, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform on 15 May 2020. We included randomised controlled trials that compared exercise-based CR interventions with no exercise training. Trial participants comprised adults aged 18 years or older who had undergone heart valve surgery for heart valve disease (from any cause) and had received heart valve replacement or heart valve repair. Both percutaneous and surgical procedures were included. Two review authors independently extracted data. We assessed the risk of systematic errors ('bias') by evaluating risk domains using the 'Risk of bias' (RoB2) tool. We assessed clinical and statistical heterogeneity. We performed meta-analyses using both fixed-effect and random-effects models. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence for primary outcomes (all-cause mortality, all-cause hospitalisation, and health-related quality of life). We included six trials with a total of 364 participants who have had open or percutaneous heart valve surgery. For this updated review, we identified four additional trials (216 participants). One trial had an overall low risk of bias, and we classified the remaining five trials as having some concerns. Follow-up ranged across included trials from 3 to 24 months. Based on data at longest follow-up, a total of nine participants died: 4 CR versus 5 control (relative risk (RR) 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 2.68; 2 trials, 131 participants; GRADE quality of evidence very low). No trials reported on cardiovascular mortality. One trial reported one cardiac-related hospitalisation in the CR group and none in the control group (RR 2.72, 95% CI 0.11 to 65.56; 1 trial, 122 participants; GRADE quality of evidence very low). We are uncertain about health-related quality of life at completion of the intervention in CR compared to control (Short Form (SF)-12/36 mental component: mean difference (MD) 1.28, 95% CI -1.60 to 4.16; 2 trials, 150 participants; GRADE quality of evidence very low; and SF-12/36 physical component: MD 2.99, 95% CI -5.24 to 11.21; 2 trials, 150 participants; GRADE quality of evidence very low), or at longest follow-up (SF-12/36 mental component: MD -1.45, 95% CI -4.70 to 1.80; 2 trials, 139 participants; GRADE quality of evidence very low; and SF-12/36 physical component: MD -0.87, 95% CI -3.57 to 1.83; 2 trials, 139 participants; GRADE quality of evidence very low). Due to lack of evidence and the very low quality of available evidence, this updated review is uncertain about the impact of exercise-CR in this population in terms of mortality, hospitalisation, and health-related quality of life. High-quality (low risk of bias) evidence on the impact of CR is needed to inform clinical guidelines and routine practice.","Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) that includes exercise training has been recommended as treatment for people after heart valve surgery.

66231fc6e1ecba676935943a,interactive_4,Methotrexate for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis,"Methotrexate has been used to treat patients with primary biliary cirrhosis because it possesses immunosuppressive properties, and a previous 2005 review showed that methotrexate seemed to significantly increase mortality in these patients; since then, follow-up data from the included trials have been published. This review assessed the beneficial and harmful effects of methotrexate for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. Randomised clinical trials were identified through searches of The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE (from inception to September 2009), reference list screening, and by contacting trial authors. Trials comparing methotrexate with placebo, no intervention, or another drug were included regardless of blinding, language, year, or publication status. Primary outcomes were mortality and mortality combined with liver transplantation; dichotomous outcomes were reported as relative risks (RR) and hazard ratios (HR), and continuous outcomes as mean differences (MD). Five trials were included. Four trials with 370 patients compared methotrexate with placebo or no intervention (three trials also added ursodeoxycholic acid to both groups); these trials had high risk of bias. There were no statistically significant effects of methotrexate on mortality (RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.66 to 2.64), mortality or liver transplantation combined, pruritus, fatigue, liver complications, liver biochemistry, liver histology, or adverse events. The pruritus score (MD -0.17, 95% CI -0.25 to -0.09) was significantly lower with methotrexate, while prothrombin time significantly worsened (MD 1.60 s, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.02). One trial with 85 patients compared methotrexate with colchicine and had low risk of bias; methotrexate did not significantly affect mortality, fatigue, liver biopsy findings, or adverse events, but significantly improved pruritus (MD -0.68, 95% CI -1.11 to -0.25), serum alkaline phosphatase (MD -0.41 U/L, 95% CI -0.70 to -0.12), and plasma immunoglobulin M (MD -0.47 mg/dL, 95% CI -0.74 to -0.20) compared with colchicine, while other outcomes showed no significant differences. Overall, methotrexate had no statistically significant effect on mortality or the need for liver transplantation in primary biliary cirrhosis, and although it may improve some laboratory and symptom outcomes, there is insufficient evidence to support its use for this condition.","Primary biliary cirrhosis is an uncommon chronic liver disease of unknown aetiology, affecting mostly women. It is characterised by progressive inflammation and destruction of the liver tissue, eventually progressing to liver cirrhosis and the need for liver transplantation. Methotrexate, a folic acid antagonist with immunosuppressive properties, has been used to treat patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. However, the evidence did not show a clear benefit of methotrexate on mortality or the need for liver transplantation in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. This review is based on five randomised trials; four comparing methotrexate with placebo, and one comparing methotrexate with colchicine. Methotrexate, compared with placebo, has no significant beneficial effect on mortality and the need for liver transplantation is not significantly reduced. The effects of methotrexate on pruritus, fatigue, clinical complications, liver biochemistry levels, liver histology, and adverse events were not significantly different from placebo. There may be some beneficial effect on pruritus score (ie, an objective measure of subjective feeling of pruritus), but we cannot recommend methotrexate for this indication only, taken into account possible adverse events. In the small trial comparing methotrexate versus colchicine, methotrexate seemed to work superior to colchicine, but it is not clear if this stems from the fact that methotrexate exerts beneficial effects as colchicine exerts harmful effects. In comparison with both placebo and colchicine, methotrexate was associated with large risks of mortality and adverse events, but the increase did not reach statistical significance.",1095,Methotrexate; primary biliary cirrhosis; immunosuppressive properties; liver transplantation; liver complications; liver biochemistry; liver histology; serum alkaline phosphatase; plasma immunoglobulin M; colchicine,Critically evaluate the claim that methotrexate improves pruritus scores in the context of primary biliary cirrhosis treatment.,"Design a follow-up study to address gaps identified in the methotrexate trials, considering biases and sample size.",Select all of the following that are fruits,What was the main aim of the study?,Summarize the overall conclusion about methotrexateâs efficacy from the document.,Pruritus improvement is one of the few significant outcomes and supports methotrexate use.; Improvements in pruritus are not sufficient to recommend methotrexate given possible adverse events.; Pruritus improvement could potentially mask more significant treatment failures.,Improvements in pruritus are not sufficient to recommend methotrexate given possible adverse events.; Pruritus improvement could potentially mask more significant treatment failures.,Increase sample size and ensure proper randomization to reduce potential biases.; Focus exclusively on male patients to evaluate gender-specific effects.; Include additional outcomes like quality of life and long-term survival.,Increase sample size and ensure proper randomization to reduce potential biases.; Include additional outcomes like quality of life and long-term survival.,dog; blue; grape,grape,To assess the effects of methotrexate compared to other treatments.; To explore new methods for treating liver diseases.; To compare the cost of different liver treatments.,To assess the effects of methotrexate compared to other treatments.,There is insufficient evidence to support its use for primary biliary cirrhosis.; It is recommended as a first-line treatment.; It has been proven as the most effective treatment.,There is insufficient evidence to support its use for primary biliary cirrhosis.
66231fc6e1ecba676935943a,finetuned_5,Best therapy for people with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who have not been treated without a targetable mutation and moderately impaired performance status,"Most people who are newly diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have advanced disease. For these people, survival is determined by various patient- and tumor-related factors, of which the performance status (PS) is the most important prognostic factor. People with PS 0 or 1 are usually treated with systemic therapies, whereas people with PS 3 or 4 most often receive supportive care. However, treatment for people with PS 2 without a targetable mutation remains unclear. Historically, people with a PS 2 cancer are frequently excluded from (important) clinical trials because of poorer outcomes and increased toxicity. We aim to address this knowledge gap, as this group of people represents a significant proportion (20% to 30%) of the total population with newly diagnosed lung cancer.
To identify the best first-line therapy for advanced lung cancer in people with performance status 2 without a targetable mutation or with an unknown mutation status.
We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. 
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared different chemotherapy (with or without angiogenesis inhibitor) or immunotherapy regimens, specifically designed for people with PS 2 only or studies including a subgroup of these people.
We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. overall survival (OS), 2. health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and 3. toxicity/adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were 4. tumor response rate, 5. progression-free survival, and 6. survival rates at six and 12 months' treatment. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence for each outcome.
We included 22 trials in this review and identified one ongoing trial. Twenty studies compared chemotherapy with different regimens, of which 11 compared non-platinum therapy (monotherapy or doublet) versus platinum doublet. We found no studies comparing best supportive care with chemotherapy and only two abstracts analyzing chemotherapy versus immunotherapy. We found that platinum doublet therapy showed superior OS compared to non-platinum therapy (hazard ratio [HR] 0.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.57 to 0.78; 7 trials, 697 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There were no differences in six-month survival rates (risk ratio [RR] 1.00, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.41; 6 trials, 632 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), whereas 12-month survival rates were improved for treatment with platinum doublet therapy (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.87 to 0.97; 11 trials, 1567 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). PFS and tumor response rate were also better for people treated with platinum doublet therapy, with moderate-certainty evidence (PFS: HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.77; 5 trials, 487 participants; tumor response rate: RR 2.25, 95% CI 1.67 to 3.05; 9 trials, 964 participants). When analyzing toxicity rates, we found that platinum doublet therapy increased grade 3 to 5 hematologic toxicities, all with low-certainty evidence (anemia: RR 1.98, 95% CI 1.00 to 3.92; neutropenia: RR 2.75, 95% CI 1.30 to 5.82; thrombocytopenia: RR 3.96, 95% CI 1.73 to 9.06; all 8 trials, 935 participants). Only four trials reported HRQoL data; however, the methodology was different per trial and we were unable to perform a meta-analysis. Although evidence is limited, there were no differences in 12-month survival rates or tumor response rates between carboplatin and cisplatin regimens. With an indirect comparison, carboplatin seemed to have better 12-month survival rates than cisplatin compared to non-platinum therapy. The assessment of the efficacy of immunotherapy in people with PS 2 was limited. There might be a place for single-agent immunotherapy, but the data provided by the included studies did not encourage the use of double-agent immunotherapy.
This review showed that as a first-line treatment for people with PS 2 with advanced NSCLC, platinum doublet therapy seems to be preferred over non-platinum therapy, with a higher response rate, PFS, and OS. Although the risk for grade 3 to 5 hematologic toxicity is higher, these events are often relatively mild and easy to treat. Since trials using checkpoint inhibitors in people with PS 2 are scarce, we identified an important knowledge gap regarding their role in people with advanced NSCLC and PS 2.","Lung cancer is the most frequent cause of cancer-related death worldwide and NSCLC is the most common subtype. At the time of diagnosis, the disease has already spread in more than half of all cases. In the tumors of a minority of people diagnosed with NSCLC that has spread to other parts of the body specific mutations can be found, which are treated distinct from the majority of people without such mutations.
NSCLC can only be treated with life-prolonging medicines such as chemotherapy (a medicine used to destroy cancer cells) or immunotherapy (a medicine that boosts the person's immune system and helps the body find and destroy cancer cells). Selecting the best treatment depends on the health condition of the person. That condition is determined using a scale from 0 (no symptoms) to 5 (dead). There is no discussion on the treatment of relatively fit people (scoring 0 or 1), as they often tolerate these treatments relatively well. People with a low health condition (scoring 3 or 4) receive only supportive care in most cases. However, although representing 20% to 30% of all people, the best treatment for moderately impaired people (PS 2) is not clear, as they often do not participate in trials.
Our objective was to investigate the best therapy for people with advanced NSCLC without a specific mutation with PS 2.
We searched medical databases for clinical trials comparing treatments for advanced NSCLC with best supportive care or other treatments.
We found 22 trials; 20 compared different types of chemotherapy and two compared chemotherapy versus immunotherapy.
People treated with chemotherapy regimens using two medicines, including a platinum-based medicine, had longer survival than people treated with chemotherapies without a platinum-based medicine. However, these people did have more side effects, especially with a negative influence on the bone marrow (matter found in the center of bones), resulting in a temporary lack of red and white blood cells, and platelets. The few studies that analyzed health-related quality of life all used different methods of measurement. We found no difference in quality of life when we looked at those studies individually. We found two partly published trials studying immunotherapy, which found no survival benefit compared to chemotherapy.
We are moderately confident in our results that chemotherapies with a platinum-based medicine increases survival. We are also moderately confident in the evidence evaluating the time to progression of disease because in all included studies, both investigators and trial participants were fully aware of which treatment the participants received. This might lead to substantial bias. In addition, we have little confidence in the evidence regarding toxicities because the evidence is based on a small number of studies with conflicting outcomes.",1023,non-small cell lung cancer; performance status; targetable mutation; immunotherapy regimens; overall survival; health-related quality of life; progression-free survival; tumor response rate; platinum doublet therapy; hematologic toxicities,What are the underlying motivations for focusing on people with performance status 2 in the study of NSCLC treatments?,How did the study distinguish between the effects of platinum-based chemotherapy versus non-platinum regimens?,Select the items that are animals,Critique the robustness of the studyÃ¢ÂÂs conclusions regarding immunotherapy for PS 2 patients.,What is the primary aim of the study discussed in the plain-language summary?,"They often tolerate treatment well, similar to those with PS 0 or 1.; They represent a significant but often neglected portion of NSCLC cases.; They are frequently included in clinical trials, which simplifies research.",They represent a significant but often neglected portion of NSCLC cases.,It demonstrated improved survival outcomes with platinum-based regimens.; It showed no difference in tumor response rates.; It highlighted consistent quality of life improvements with non-platinum regimens.,It demonstrated improved survival outcomes with platinum-based regimens.,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,The study robustly proves the superiority of immunotherapy over chemotherapy.; The evidence for the efficacy of immunotherapy was limited.; The study found clear benefits of double-agent immunotherapy.,The evidence for the efficacy of immunotherapy was limited.,To find the best therapy for people with PS 2 in advanced NSCLC without a specific mutation; To develop a new platinum-based chemotherapy drug; To compare supportive care with chemotherapy,To find the best therapy for people with PS 2 in advanced NSCLC without a specific mutation
66231fc6e1ecba676935943a,finetuned_6,Benefits and harms of antibiotics for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease,"Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of mortality worldwide with approximately 7.4 million deaths each year. People with established coronary heart disease have a high risk of subsequent cardiovascular events including myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death. Antibiotics might prevent such outcomes due to their antibacterial, antiinflammatory, and antioxidative effects. However, a randomised clinical trial and several observational studies have suggested that antibiotics may increase the risk of cardiovascular events and mortality. Furthermore, several non-Cochrane Reviews, that are now outdated, have assessed the effects of antibiotics for coronary heart disease and have shown conflicting results. No previous systematic review using Cochrane methodology has assessed the effects of antibiotics for coronary heart disease. We assessed the benefits and harms of antibiotics compared with placebo or no intervention for the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, SCI-EXPANDED, and BIOSIS in December 2019 in order to identify relevant trials. Additionally, we searched TRIP, Google Scholar, and nine trial registries in December 2019. We also contacted 11 pharmaceutical companies and searched the reference lists of included trials, previous systematic reviews, and other types of reviews. Randomised clinical trials assessing the effects of antibiotics versus placebo or no intervention for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease in adult participants (?18 years) were included irrespective of setting, blinding, publication status, publication year, language, and reporting of outcomes. Three review authors independently extracted data. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, serious adverse event according to ICH-GCP, and quality of life. Secondary outcomes were cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, and sudden cardiac death. The primary time point of interest was at maximum follow-up, and data were also extracted at 24±6 months follow-up. Risks of systematic errors were assessed using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool, and risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated. We included 38 trials randomising 26,638 participants (mean age 61.6 years), with 23/38 trials reporting data on 26,078 participants suitable for meta-analysis. Three trials were at low risk of bias and the remaining 35 were at high risk of bias. Trials assessing macrolides (28 trials; 22,059 participants) and quinolones (two trials; 4162 participants) contributed most of the data. Meta-analyses at maximum follow-up showed that antibiotics versus placebo or no intervention seemed to increase the risk of all-cause mortality (RR 1.06; 95% CI 0.99 to 1.13), stroke (RR 1.14; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.29), and probably also cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.11; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.25). Little to no difference was observed for myocardial infarction (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.88 to 1.03) and sudden cardiac death (RR 1.08; 95% CI 0.90 to 1.31). Meta-analyses at 24±6 months follow-up showed that antibiotics increased the risk of all-cause mortality (RR 1.25; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.48), cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.50; 95% CI 1.17 to 1.91), and probably also sudden cardiac death (RR 1.77; 95% CI 1.28 to 2.44). No evidence of a difference was found for myocardial infarction or stroke at this time point. Meta-analyses of trials at low risk of bias differed only for cardiovascular mortality at maximum follow-up; all other outcomes were consistent with overall analyses. None of the trials specifically assessed serious adverse events according to ICH-GCP, and no data were available on quality of life. Current evidence suggests that antibiotics (macrolides or quinolones) for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease appear harmful when assessing all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and stroke at maximum follow-up, as well as all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and sudden cardiac death at 24±6 months follow-up. Therefore, current evidence does not support the clinical use of macrolides or quinolones for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease. Future trials examining the safety of these antibiotics for this purpose do not seem ethical, and antibiotic trials in general require longer follow-up to capture late adverse events.","Coronary heart disease, also known as cardiovascular disease, is the leading cause of death worldwide with approximately 7.4 million deaths each year. Coronary heart disease is caused by decreased blood supply to the heart. The severity of the disease ranges from chest pain during exercise to heart attack. Antibiotics might help patients with coronary heart disease and reduce their risk of heart attacks, strokes, chest pain, revascularisation procedures, and death. However, a randomised clinical trial and several observational studies suggested that antibiotics increased the risk of cardiovascular events and death. The aim of this Cochrane systematic review was to assess the benefits and harms of antibiotics in adult patients with coronary heart disease. We primarily assessed the benefits and harms at maximum follow-up and secondly at 24±6 months follow-up. We searched various scientific databases from their inception to December 2019 and found 38 trials where people with coronary heart disease were randomly allocated to antibiotics versus placebo or no intervention. The 38 trials included 26,638 adults with a mean age of 61.6 years. 23 out of the 38 trials reported data on 26,078 participants that could be analysed. The vast majority of the data was contributed by trials assessing the effects of macrolide antibiotics (28 trials; 22,059 participants) and quinolone antibiotics (two trials; 4162 participants), while insufficient data were contributed by trials assessing the effects of tetracycline antibiotics (eight trials; 417 participants). Three trials were at low risk of bias and the remaining trials were at high risk of bias. Patients receiving antibiotics (macrolide antibiotics or quinolone antibiotics) compared with patients receiving placebo or no intervention seemed at a slightly higher risk of death from all causes, death from a cardiac cause, and having a stroke at maximum follow-up. Moreover, a slightly higher risk was also observed when assessing death from all causes, death from a cardiac cause, and sudden death from a cardiac cause at 24±6 months follow-up. None of the trials sufficiently reported the number of participants with serious adverse events. No data were provided on quality of life. Future trials on the safety of macrolide antibiotics or quinolone antibiotics for the secondary prevention in adult patients with coronary heart disease do not seem ethical.",1045,Coronary heart disease; myocardial infarction; stroke; secondary prevention; macrolides; quinolones; placebo; cardiovascular mortality,How might the risk of bias in trials impact the interpretation of results regarding antibiotics for coronary heart disease?,What rationale can be evaluated for not supporting further trials of antibiotics as secondary prevention for coronary heart disease?,Select all of the following that are fruits,What was the primary aim of the Cochrane systematic review?,What was the result of the meta-analyses at maximum follow-up regarding all-cause mortality?,They could overestimate the beneficial effects of antibiotics; They ensure that the results are more reliable; They could lead to underreporting of adverse events,They could overestimate the beneficial effects of antibiotics; They could lead to underreporting of adverse events,Evidence indicates potential harm in terms of mortality; Antibiotics have consistently shown beneficial effects; Concerns about ethical considerations in patient safety,Evidence indicates potential harm in terms of mortality; Concerns about ethical considerations in patient safety,dog; blue; grape,grape,To assess the benefits and harms of antibiotics in adult patients with coronary heart disease.; To compare different types of antibiotics for various diseases.; To evaluate the effectiveness of new surgical procedures for heart disease.,To assess the benefits and harms of antibiotics in adult patients with coronary heart disease.,Antibiotics increased the risk of all-cause mortality.; Antibiotics decreased the risk of all-cause mortality.; There was no difference in all-cause mortality.,Antibiotics increased the risk of all-cause mortality.
66231fc6e1ecba676935943a,finetuned_6,What are the benefits and harms of remote ischaemic conditioning (briefly restricting then restoring blood flow) for preventing and treating stroke?,"Remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) has been developed as a neuroprotective strategy to prevent and treat ischaemic stroke. It usually involves restricting blood flow to limbs and then releasing the ischaemic blood to promote a neuroprotective effect. Preclinical studies have suggested that RIC may have beneficial effects in ischaemic stroke patients and those at risk of ischaemic stroke. However, existing evidence is insufficient to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of RIC in preventing and treating ischaemic stroke. To evaluate the benefits and harms of remote ischaemic conditioning in preventing and treating ischaemic stroke compared to sham or standard treatments. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, three Chinese databases, five trials registers, and conference proceedings, together with reference checking and citation searching. The latest search date was 11 March 2025. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing RIC with sham RIC or medical management in people with ischaemic stroke or at risk of ischaemic stroke. Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed trial quality and risk of bias, and extracted data. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence. We included seven trials, involving 735 participants, in this review. We analysed the effects of RIC on preventing and treating ischaemic stroke respectively. We evaluated risk of bias and judged it to be low for generation of allocation sequence in six studies and unclear in one study; unclear for allocation concealment in four studies and low in three studies; high for incomplete outcome data (attrition bias) in five studies and low in two studies; high for blinding in three studies and low in four studies; low for selective reporting; and high for other sources of bias in six studies and low in one study. We included three trials (involving 371 participants) in the analysis of the effects of RIC on ischaemic stroke prevention. In people with symptomatic intracerebral artery stenosis, recurrent stroke was significantly reduced by RIC (risk ratio (RR) 0.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12 to 0.83; 2 trials, 182 participants, low-quality evidence). In people with carotid stenosis undergoing carotid stenting, there was no significant difference in the incidence of ischaemic stroke between participants treated with RIC and non-RIC (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.03; 1 trial, 189 participants, low-quality evidence); however the stroke severity (assessed by infarct volume) was significantly lower in participants treated with RIC (mean difference (MD) -0.17 mL, 95% CI -0.23 to -0.11; 1 trial, 189 participants, low-quality evidence). Adverse events associated with RIC were significantly higher in participants treated with RIC (RR 10.91; 95% CI 2.01 to 59.28; 3 trials, 371 participants, low-quality evidence), but no severe adverse event was attributable to RIC treatment. No participants experienced death or cardiovascular events during the period of the studies; and no trial reported haemorrhagic stroke or improvement in neurological, phycological or cognitive impairment. We included four trials (involving 364 participants) in the analysis of the effects of RIC on ischaemic stroke treatment. In acute ischaemic stroke, for people receiving intravenous thrombolysis, the rate of death or dependency was significantly increased by RIC treatment compared with non-RIC treatment (RR 2.34; 95% 1.19 to 4.61; 1 trial, 285 participants, low-quality evidence). In people with acute ischaemic stroke, there was no significant difference between RIC and non-RIC for reducing stroke severity as assessed by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score and the final infarct volume (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.24 mL, 95% CI -1.02 to 0.54; 2 trials, 175 participants, very low quality evidence). There was no significant difference between RIC and non-RIC for improving the psychological impairment (SMD -0.37 points, 95% CI -1.15 to 0.41; 1 trial, 26 participants, very low quality evidence) and the cognitive impairment (SMD -0.26 points; 95% CI -0.72 to 0.21; 3 trials, 79 participants, low-quality evidence) in people with acute ischaemic stroke and cerebral small vessel disease. No trial reported ischaemic stroke, recurrent ischaemic stroke, improvement in neurological impairment, hemorrhagic stroke, cardiovascular events, and RIC associated adverse events. There is moderate-certainty evidence that RIC compared to non-RIC probably reduces recurrence of ischaemic stroke slightly, and low-certainty evidence that RIC may result in a slight increase in excellent functional outcome (mRS 0 to 1). Evidence for improvement in NIHSS scores is very uncertain due to risk of bias and imprecision. RIC demonstrated an acceptable harm profile with no increase in intracerebral haemorrhage or mortality; however, treatment-related adverse events were more common. The certainty of evidence was limited by high risk of bias for blinding in most studies, incomplete outcome data in some studies, and imprecision in several outcomes. However, the generalisability of these findings may be limited because 79.3% of participants were from China, highlighting the need for further studies in diverse populations to confirm the results. The optimal timing, duration, and method of RIC administration require further investigation through large, high-quality randomised trials with standardised protocols to establish definitive evidence for clinical practice. This updated analysis includes 16 new RCTs, and these findings highlight the need for ongoing research and careful consideration of study design and methodology in future investigations.","Ischaemic stroke is the most common type of stroke. It occurs when a blood clot blocks an artery that supplies blood to the brain. This blockage cuts off the supply of oxygen and nutrients to a part of the brain. Without this blood supply, brain cells in that area are damaged and begin to die. Remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) involves briefly and repeatedly restricting and then restoring blood flow in a limb (an arm or leg) with a blood pressure cuff. The goal is to ""condition"" the limb and trigger the body's natural defences to protect other organs. Studies have found that for people who have had a stroke and are receiving standard medical care, adding RIC can reduce the amount of brain tissue damaged by the stroke, improve recovery of everyday functions, help prevent another stroke from happening, and reduce problems with memory and thinking.
We wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of RIC in people who have had an ischaemic stroke and are undergoing various treatments, including standard medical therapy, intravenous thrombolysis (a clot-dissolving treatment), or mechanical thrombectomy (a procedure to remove clots). Specifically, we wanted to know if RIC was better than sham or standard treatment for improving:
- the risk of dying;
- the risk of having another stroke;
- the likelihood of an excellent recovery (a score on the Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) of 0 to 1);
- the likelihood of being able to live independently (mRS score of 0 to 2);
- the risk of a brain bleed;
- brain function issues;
- the risk of major heart problems.
We also wanted to know if RIC has unwanted effects.
We searched for studies that compared the benefits and harms of remote ischaemic conditioning in people with ischaemic stroke. We then compared and summarised the study results and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and sample sizes.
We found 21 studies with 7687 people. The studies took place in China, Denmark, France, the UK, and Romania, and were published between 2012 and 2025.
Sixteen studies including 6828 participants suggested that RIC compared to sham or no treatment probably leads to a slight reduction in the risk of having another stroke. About half the studies measured participants' level of independence using the mRS and measured change in brain function issues using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). RIC might lead to a slight increase in the number of people achieving an excellent recovery, but may have little or no effect on the number of people being able to live independently. In addition, RIC might result in a slight improvement in brain function issues, but the evidence is very uncertain. There may be little or no difference between RIC and sham or standard treatment in the risk of a brain bleed and major heart problems, and RIC probably does not increase the risk of death. However, RIC may have unwanted effects such as arm pain, redness, or swelling.
We also identified 21 ongoing studies that we plan to add to the next version of our review.
Our confidence in the evidence is moderate to very low for several reasons. Most studies had few participants, and more than half of studies were done in China, which means the results of our review may not apply to people in other parts of the world. Some studies included people who received clot-dissolving treatment (thrombolysis) and people who did not, and we could not separate the results for these two groups. This mix of patients may have affected our overall analysis. Finally, we did not separate the results in our analysis based on the type of comparison group used (sham or standard treatment). This means it is difficult to know if the treatment effect we found was influenced by the type of comparison.",1069,Ischaemic stroke; Remote ischaemic conditioning; Neuroprotective effect; Symptomatic intracerebral artery stenosis; Carotid stenosis; Intravenous thrombolysis; Infarct volume; National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale; Carotid stenting,What is the primary goal of remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) mentioned in the summary?,What effects of RIC on brain function issues were summarized?,Select the items that are animals,How does RIC compare to sham or standard treatment in terms of stroke recurrence risk?,What was evaluated alongside the benefits of RIC in the summary?,To dissolve existing blood clots in the brain.; To trigger the body's natural defenses to protect other organs.; To permanently restrict blood flow to limbs.,To trigger the body's natural defenses to protect other organs.,RIC might result in a slight improvement in brain function issues.; RIC causes significant decline in cognitive function.; RIC has no impact on brain function issues.,RIC might result in a slight improvement in brain function issues.,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,RIC probably leads to a slight reduction in the risk of having another stroke.; RIC significantly increases the risk of recurrent stroke.; RIC has no effect on stroke recurrence risk.,RIC probably leads to a slight reduction in the risk of having another stroke.,The harms of RIC were also evaluated.; Only the economic cost of RIC was evaluated.; RIC's compatibility with other conditions was evaluated.,The harms of RIC were also evaluated.
655f95ffd90905e27c938a49,static_1,First-line treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer identified as being EGFR mutation positive,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation positive (M+) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is an important subtype of lung cancer comprising 10% to 15% of non-squamous tumours. This subtype is more common in women than men, is less associated with smoking, but occurs at a younger age than sporadic tumours.
To assess the clinical effectiveness of single-agent or combination EGFR therapies used in the first-line treatment of people with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR M+ NSCLC compared with other cytotoxic chemotherapy (CTX) agents used alone or in combination, or best supportive care (BSC). The primary outcomes were overall survival and progression-free survival. Secondary outcomes included response rate, symptom palliation, toxicity, and health-related quality of life.
We conducted electronic searches of the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2020, Issue 7), MEDLINE (1946 to 27th July 2020), Embase (1980 to 27th July 2020), and ISI Web of Science (1899 to 27th July 2020). We also searched the conference abstracts of the American Society for Clinical Oncology and the European Society for Medical Oncology (July 2020); Evidence Review Group submissions to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence; and the reference lists of retrieved articles.
Parallel-group randomised controlled trials comparing EGFR-targeted agents (alone or in combination with cytotoxic agents or BSC) with cytotoxic chemotherapy (single or doublet) or BSC in chemotherapy-naive patients with locally advanced or metastatic (stage IIIB or IV) EGFR M+ NSCLC unsuitable for treatment with curative intent.
Two review authors independently identified articles, extracted data, and carried out the 'Risk of bias' assessment. We conducted meta-analyses using a fixed-effect model unless there was substantial heterogeneity, in which case we also performed a random-effects analysis as a sensitivity analysis.
Twenty-two trials met the inclusion criteria. Ten of these exclusively recruited people with EGFR M+ NSCLC; the remainder recruited a mixed population and reported results for people with EGFR M+ NSCLC as subgroup analyses. The number of participants with EGFR M+ tumours totalled 3023, of whom approximately 2563 were of Asian origin. Overall survival (OS) data showed inconsistent results between the included trials that compared EGFR-targeted treatments against cytotoxic chemotherapy or placebo. Erlotinib was used in eight trials, gefitinib in nine trials, afatinib in two trials, cetuximab in two trials, and icotinib in one trial. The findings of FASTACT 2 suggested a clinical benefit for OS for participants treated with erlotinib plus cytotoxic chemotherapy when compared to cytotoxic chemotherapy alone, as did the Han 2017 trial for gefitinib plus cytotoxic chemotherapy, but both results were based on a small number of participants (n = 97 and 122, respectively). For progression-free survival (PFS), a pooled analysis of four trials showed evidence of clinical benefit for erlotinib compared with cytotoxic chemotherapy (hazard ratio (HR) 0.31; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25 to 0.39 ; 583 participants ; high-certainty evidence). A pooled analysis of two trials of gefitinib versus paclitaxel plus carboplatin showed evidence of clinical benefit for PFS for gefitinib (HR 0.39; 95% CI 0.32 to 0.48 ; 491 participants high-certainty evidence), and a pooled analysis of two trials of gefitinib versus pemetrexed plus carboplatin with pemetrexed maintenance also showed evidence of clinical benefit for PFS for gefitinib (HR 0.59; 95% CI 0.46 to 0.74, 371 participants ; moderate-certainty evidence). Afatinib showed evidence of clinical benefit for PFS when compared with chemotherapy in a pooled analysis of two trials (HR 0.42; 95% CI 0.34 to 0.53, 709 participants high-certainty evidence). All but one small trial showed a corresponding improvement in response rate with tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) compared to chemotherapy. Commonly reported grade 3/4 adverse events associated with afatinib, erlotinib, gefitinib and icotinib monotherapy were rash and diarrhoea. Myelosuppression was consistently worse in the chemotherapy arms; fatigue and anorexia were also associated with some chemotherapies. Seven trials reported on health-related quality of life and symptom improvement using different methodologies. For each of erlotinib, gefitinib, and afatinib, two trials showed improvement in one or more indices for the TKI compared to chemotherapy. The quality of evidence was high for the comparisons of erlotinib and gefitinib with cytotoxic chemotherapy and for the comparison of afatinib with cytotoxic chemotherapy.
Erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib and icotinib are all active agents in EGFR M+ NSCLC patients, and demonstrate an increased tumour response rate and prolonged PFS compared to cytotoxic chemotherapy. We found a beneficial effect of the TKI compared to cytotoxic chemotherapy in adverse effect and health-related quality of life. We found limited evidence for increased OS for the TKI when compared with standard chemotherapy, but the majority of the included trials allowed participants to switch treatments on disease progression, which will have a confounding effect on any OS analysis. Single agent-TKI remains the standard of care and the benefit of combining a TKI and chemotherapy remains uncertain as the evidence is based on small patient numbers. Cytotoxic chemotherapy is less effective in EGFR M+ NSCLC than erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib or icotinib and is associated with greater toxicity. There are no data supporting the use of monoclonal antibody therapy. Icotinib is not available outside China.","Lung cancer is the most common cancer in the world. It has often spread by the time it is diagnosed. Therefore, surgery is usually not possible and drug treatment, typically chemotherapy, is needed. The commonest type of lung cancer is non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Around 10% to 15% of people with NSCLC will have a specific kind of cancer known as epidermal growth factor receptor positive (EGFR M+), in which there are changes in the cancer cells to the genes controlling tumour growth. In this review, we looked at new treatments that can target EGFR M+ NSCLC to find out how well they work.
The purpose of this review was to find out whether people given treatments targeted at EGFR M+ NSCLC live longer and have a better health-related quality of life than people having standard chemotherapy.
We found 22 trials that looked at five different EGFR-targeted drugs and compared them with standard chemotherapy treatment: erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib, icotinib and the antibody cetuximab. We included trials reporting results up to 27 July 2020.
Our results showed that people given erlotinib, gefitinib,afatinib or icotinib have a longer time before the cancer progresses and experience fewer side effects than those people given standard chemotherapy. However, we could not be sure whether people given erlotinib, afatinib or icotinib live any longer than those given standard chemotherapy.
Erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib and icotinib delay further spread of EGFR M+ lung cancer and improve health-related quality of life.

655f95ffd90905e27c938a49,static_2,Is molnupiravir (an antiviral medicine) safe and effective in treating people with COVID-19?,"To assess the effects of molnupiravir in people with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and mild to moderate symptoms. We identified all relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) by searching the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, Science Citation Index Expanded, the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Literature on Coronavirus Disease database, and the COVID Network Meta-Analysis database with no language restrictions up to 26 April 2024. In outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19, molnupiravir 800 mg taken orally every 12 hours for five days probably results in little to no difference in all-cause mortality and may result in little to no difference in rates of hospitalisation and symptom resolution. There is evidence of increased viral clearance by day 5, but the clinical relevance of this finding is unclear. There is probably little to no difference in adverse events, and there is little to no difference in serious adverse events, with molnupiravir versus placebo or standard care. Inpatient data are lacking, and there is no evidence of benefit of molnupiravir in this population. Further research involving inpatients may change this.","Molnupiravir is a pill used to treat COVID-19 in people who are at high risk of developing severe illness. It works by interfering with the ability of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) to reproduce, helping the body to fight off the infection. We wanted to find out how molnupiravir compares to no treatment, placebo (dummy treatment), or standard of care in decreasing death and hospitalisation in people with COVID-19; speeding up recovery (time to symptom resolution); clearing the virus that causes COVID-19 (viral clearance); safety, by looking at all unwanted events and serious unwanted events. We searched for studies that evaluated molnupiravir compared with no treatment, placebo, or standard of care in people with confirmed COVID-19. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods. The types of studies we looked at were randomised controlled trials, which assign people randomly to two or more treatment groups. This is the best way to ensure that study groups are similar, and that investigators and participants don't know who is in which group. The review included 11 studies with 31,272 participants, mostly outpatients (people not admitted to hospital) with mild to moderate COVID-19. When we combined results from studies that recruited outpatients (people not admitted to hospital) with mild to moderate COVID-19, we found the following key results: Molnupiravir probably results in little to no difference in the risk of death. Compared with people receiving placebo or standard of care, between four and 10 fewer people receiving molnupiravir will die within one month for every 10,000 people treated. We considered this reduction clinically insignificant. Molnupiravir may not reduce hospitalisations, meaning it may not prevent people from getting sicker or needing hospital care. There was evidence of increased viral clearance with molnupiravir by day 5, but this effect diminished by day 14, and we are not sure if it makes any real difference for patients. Molnupiravir may have little to no effect on the probability of having no symptoms by day 14 or day 28. Molnupiravir probably results in little to no difference in adverse events, and results in little to no difference in serious adverse events. There are too few data to draw clear conclusions about molnupiravir's effects in people admitted to hospital with severe COVID-19. Most evidence comes from studies conducted in outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19, so the results may not apply to people with severe illness who are hospitalised. The studies provided scarce evidence on long-term outcomes such as quality of life after recovery or how long the virus stays in the body. We were unable to analyse whether molnupiravir had a different effect in certain groups of people, like those with severe pre-existing conditions or people from low- or middle-income countries.",1106,molnupiravir; SARS-CoV-2; mild to moderate COVID-19; all-cause mortality; symptom resolution; viral clearance; clinical relevance; adverse events,What reasoning could justify the conclusion that molnupiravir has little effect on hospitalisations in mild COVID-19 cases?,How might the design of future studies be improved to better assess molnupiravir's effectiveness in severe COVID-19 cases?,Select the items that are animals,What conclusions might be drawn from the evidence of increased viral clearance by day 5 with no significant impact on symptoms?,What challenges could arise in interpreting the clinical relevance of viral clearance associated with molnupiravir?,No significant difference in hospitalisation rates compared to placebo; Possible misinterpretation of viral clearance as recovery; Bias introduced by non-randomized study designs,No significant difference in hospitalisation rates compared to placebo,Including a larger sample of hospitalised patients; Excluding all outpatients to reduce variability; Focusing on participants from higher-income countries,Including a larger sample of hospitalised patients,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,Viral clearance may not correlate directly with clinical outcomes; The study possibly had errors in measuring viral load; Molnupiravir has a durable effect lasting beyond day 5,Viral clearance may not correlate directly with clinical outcomes,Lack of alignment between viral clearance and patient recovery; Overstated results from non-peer-reviewed studies; Underrepresentation of severe cases in the data,Lack of alignment between viral clearance and patient recovery
655f95ffd90905e27c938a49,static_2,Bisphosphonates and denosumab for breast cancer,"Bone is the most common site of metastatic disease associated with breast cancer (BC). Bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, and novel targeted therapies such as denosumab inhibit other key bone metabolism pathways. We have studied these agents in both early breast cancer and advanced breast cancer settings. This is an update of the review originally published in 2002 and subsequently updated in 2005 and 2012.
To assess the effects of bisphosphonates and other bone agents in addition to anti-cancer treatment: (i) in women with early breast cancer (EBC); (ii) in women with advanced breast cancer without bone metastases (ABC); and (iii) in women with metastatic breast cancer and bone metastases (BCBM).
In this review update, we searched Cochrane Breast Cancer's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov on 19 September 2016.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing: (a) one treatment with a bisphosphonate/bone-acting agent with the same treatment without a bisphosphonate/bone-acting agent; (b) treatment with one bisphosphonate versus treatment with a different bisphosphonate; (c) treatment with a bisphosphonate versus another bone-acting agent of a different mechanism of action (e.g. denosumab); and (d) immediate treatment with a bisphosphonate/bone-acting agent versus delayed treatment of the same bisphosphonate/bone-acting agent.
Two review authors independently extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and quality of the evidence. The primary outcome measure was bone metastases for EBC and ABC, and a skeletal-related event (SRE) for BCBM. We derived risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and the meta-analyses used random-effects models. Secondary outcomes included overall survival and disease-free survival for EBC; we derived hazard ratios (HRs) for these time-to-event outcomes where possible. We collected toxicity and quality-of-life information. GRADE was used to assess the quality of evidence for the most important outcomes in each treatment setting.
We included 44 RCTs involving 37,302 women. In women with EBC, bisphosphonates were associated with a reduced risk of bone metastases compared to placebo/no bisphosphonate (RR 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75 to 0.99; P = 0.03, 11 studies; 15,005 women; moderate-quality evidence with no significant heterogeneity). Bisphosphonates provided an overall survival benefit with time-to-event data (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.99; P = 0.04; 9 studies; 13,949 women; high-quality evidence with evidence of heterogeneity). Subgroup analysis by menopausal status showed a survival benefit from bisphosphonates in postmenopausal women (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.90; P = 0.001; 4 studies; 6048 women; high-quality evidence with no evidence of heterogeneity) but no survival benefit for premenopausal women (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.22; P = 0.78; 2 studies; 3501 women; high-quality evidence with no heterogeneity). There was evidence of no effect of bisphosphonates on disease-free survival (HR 0.94, 95% 0.87 to 1.02; P = 0.13; 7 studies; 12,578 women; high-quality evidence with significant heterogeneity present) however subgroup analyses showed a disease-free survival benefit from bisphosphonates in postmenopausal women only (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.91; P < 0.001; 7 studies; 8314 women; high-quality evidence with no heterogeneity). Bisphosphonates did not significantly reduce the incidence of fractures when compared to placebo/no bisphosphonates (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.08, P = 0.13, 6 studies, 7602 women; moderate-quality evidence due to wide confidence intervals). We await mature overall survival and disease-free survival results for denosumab trials. In women with ABC without clinically evident bone metastases, there was no evidence of an effect of bisphosphonates on bone metastases (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.43; P = 0.86; 3 studies; 330 women; moderate-quality evidence with no heterogeneity) or overall survival (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.09; P = 0.28; 3 studies; 330 women; high-quality evidence with no heterogeneity) compared to placebo/no bisphosphonates however the confidence intervals were wide. One study reported a trend towards an extended period of time without a SRE with bisphosphonate compared to placebo (low-quality evidence). One study reported quality of life and there was no apparent difference in scores between bisphosphonate and placebo (moderate-quality evidence). In women with BCBM, bisphosphonates reduced the SRE risk by 14% (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.95; P = 0.003; 9 studies; 2810 women; high-quality evidence with evidence of heterogeneity) compared with placebo/no bisphosphonates. This benefit persisted when administering either intravenous or oral bisphosphonates versus placebo. Bisphosphonates delayed the median time to a SRE with a median ratio of 1.43 (95% CI 1.29 to 1.58; P < 0.00001; 9 studies; 2891 women; high-quality evidence with no heterogeneity) and reduced bone pain (in 6 out of 11 studies; moderate-quality evidence) compared to placebo/no bisphosphonate. Treatment with bisphosphonates did not appear to affect overall survival (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.11; P = 0.85; 7 studies; 1935 women; moderate-quality evidence with significant heterogeneity). Quality-of-life scores were slightly better with bisphosphonates than placebo at comparable time points (in three out of five studies; moderate-quality evidence) however scores decreased during the course of the studies. Denosumab reduced the risk of developing a SRE compared with bisphosphonates by 22% (RR 0.78, 0.72 to 0.85; P < 0.001; 3 studies, 2345 women). One study reported data on overall survival and observed no difference in survival between denosumab and bisphosphonate. Reported toxicities across all settings were generally mild. Osteonecrosis of the jaw was rare, occurring less than 0.5% in the adjuvant setting (high-quality evidence).
For women with EBC, bisphosphonates reduce the risk of bone metastases and provide an overall survival benefit compared to placebo or no bisphosphonates. There is preliminary evidence suggestive that bisphosphonates provide an overall survival and disease-free survival benefit in postmenopausal women only when compared to placebo or no bisphosphonate. This was not a planned subgroup for these early trials, and we await the completion of new large clinical trials assessing benefit for postmenopausal women. For women with BCBM, bisphosphonates reduce the risk of developing SREs, delay the median time to an SRE, and appear to reduce bone pain compared to placebo or no bisphosphonate.","Breast cancer may spread and recur in the bones. This may cause fractures, pain and high calcium in the bloodstream (known as complications).
Medicines for osteoporosis may prevent these complications and may help cure cancer by reducing cancer growth in the bone. These medicines are called 'bisphosphonates'. A newer type is called  denosumab. Bisphosphonates or denosumab are given in addition to other cancer treatment medications. These may be given along with chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, or radiotherapy.
The goal of bisphosphonates and denosumab differs based on the women's breast cancer status.
We asked three main questions:
1. For women with early breast cancer (EBC) , can bisphosphonates or denosumab reduce the risk of the cancer spreading to the bone? Will adding this medicine to anticancer treatments allow women to live longer (improve survival)?
2. For women with advanced breast cancer which does not appear to involve the bone (ABC) , can bisphosphonates reduce the risk of the cancer spreading to the bone and improve survival? Will bisphosphonates reduce complications and improve quality of life?
3. For women with metastatic breast cancer that has spread to the bone (BCBM), can bisphosphonates or denosumab reduce the risk of complication, and improve quality of life and survival?
We found 44 studies involving 37,302 participants. We included studies published by September 2016.
For women with EBC, we included 17 studies with 26,129 participants. The women's health was monitored for at least 12 months from the start of the study. Some studies monitored women for 10 years.
The studies tested different types of bisphosphonate drugs and denosumab, and different doses of these drugs. Some studies compared the drugs to no treatment. Some studies used oral medications. Other studies gave the medicine as an injection into a vein or under the skin.
Bisphosphonates probably lowered the risk of cancer spreading to the bone.
Bisphosphonates were found to improve survival, but the benefit in the whole group of women was small. Postmenopausal women had a benefit from bisphosphonates with improved survival and reduced risk of cancer returning. Premenopausal women did not have improved survival or reduced risk of the cancer returning. New studies that test bisphosphonates by the women's menopausal status are awaited.
We await the reporting of data on survival and other important outcomes from denosumab trials.
For women with ABC that had not spread to the bone, we included three studies enrolling 330 participants. All three studies compared oral bisphosphonates to no treatment.
Bisphosphonates did not reduce the risk of cancer spreading to the bone or improve survival. Very little information was available on complications and quality of life from only one study.
For women with BCBM, we included 24 studies enrolling 10,853 participants. Their health was monitored for at least 12 months. Some women were followed for 24 months. Most studies compared bisphosphonates to receiving no medication.
Bisphosphonates reduced complications (fractures and bone pain). Bisphosphonates did not appear to increase the length of time women survived. Quality of life scores were slightly better for women receiving bisphosphonates compared to similar women having no bisphosphonates.
Denosumab reduced the risk of complications compared to bisphosphonates in the three studies that collected these data. There was no benefit in survival from denosumab in the one study that collected data.
Side effects were uncommon and mild. There was a rare risk of damage to the jaw bone (osteonecrosis of the jaw).

655f95ffd90905e27c938a49,interactive_3,Cannabis-based medicines for cancer pain,"Pain is a common symptom in people with cancer; 30% to 50% of people with cancer will experience moderate-to-severe pain. This can have a major negative impact on their quality of life. Opioid (morphine-like) medications are commonly used to treat moderate or severe cancer pain, and are recommended for this purpose in the World Health Organization (WHO) pain treatment ladder. Pain is not sufficiently relieved by opioid medications in 10% to 15% of people with cancer. In people with insufficient relief of cancer pain, new analgesics are needed to effectively and safely supplement or replace opioids. To evaluate the benefits and harms of cannabis-based medicines, including medical cannabis, for treating pain and other symptoms in adults with cancer compared to placebo or any other established analgesic for cancer pain. We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 26 January 2023. We selected double-blind randomised, controlled trials (RCT) of medical cannabis, plant-derived and synthetic cannabis-based medicines against placebo or any other active treatment for cancer pain in adults, with any treatment duration and at least 10 participants per treatment arm. We used standard Cochrane methods. The primary outcomes were 1. proportions of participants reporting no worse than mild pain; 2. Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) of much improved or very much improved and 3. withdrawals due to adverse events. Secondary outcomes were 4. number of participants who reported pain relief of 30% or greater and overall opioid use reduced or stable; 5. number of participants who reported pain relief of 30% or greater, or 50% or greater; 6. pain intensity; 7. sleep problems; 8. depression and anxiety; 9. daily maintenance and breakthrough opioid dosage; 10. dropouts due to lack of efficacy; 11. all central nervous system adverse events. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence for each outcome. We identified 14 studies involving 1823 participants. No study assessed the proportions of participants reporting no worse than mild pain on treatment by 14 days after start of treatment. We found five RCTs assessing oromucosal nabiximols (tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD)) or THC alone involving 1539 participants with moderate or severe pain despite opioid therapy. The double-blind periods of the RCTs ranged between two and five weeks. Four studies with a parallel design and 1333 participants were available for meta-analysis. There was moderate-certainty evidence that there was no clinically relevant benefit for proportions of PGIC much or very much improved (risk difference (RD) 0.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 0.12; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 16, 95% CI 8 to 100). There was moderate-certainty evidence for no clinically relevant difference in the proportion of withdrawals due to adverse events (RD 0.04, 95% CI 0 to 0.08; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 25, 95% CI 16 to endless). There was moderate-certainty evidence for no difference between nabiximols or THC and placebo in the frequency of serious adverse events (RD 0.02, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.07). There was moderate-certainty evidence that nabiximols and THC used as add-on treatment for opioid-refractory cancer pain did not differ from placebo in reducing mean pain intensity (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.19, 95% CI -0.40 to 0.02). There was low-certainty evidence that a synthetic THC analogue (nabilone) delivered over eight weeks was not superior to placebo in reducing pain associated with chemotherapy or radiochemotherapy in people with head and neck cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (2 studies, 89 participants, qualitative analysis). Analyses of tolerability and safety were not possible for these studies. There was low-certainty evidence that synthetic THC analogues were superior to placebo (SMD -0.98, 95% CI -1.36 to -0.60), but not superior to low-dose codeine (SMD 0.03, 95% CI -0.25 to 0.32; 5 single-dose trials; 126 participants) in reducing moderate-to-severe cancer pain after cessation of previous analgesic treatment for three to four and a half hours (2 single-dose trials; 66 participants). Analyses of tolerability and safety were not possible for these studies. There was low-certainty evidence that CBD oil did not add value to specialist palliative care alone in the reduction of pain intensity in people with advanced cancer. There was no difference in the number of dropouts due to adverse events and serious adverse events (1 study, 144 participants, qualitative analysis). We found no studies using herbal cannabis. There is moderate-certainty evidence that oromucosal nabiximols and THC are ineffective in relieving moderate-to-severe opioid-refractory cancer pain. There is low-certainty evidence that nabilone is ineffective in reducing pain associated with (radio-) chemotherapy in people with head and neck cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. There is low-certainty evidence that a single dose of synthetic THC analogues is not superior to a single low-dose morphine equivalent in reducing moderate-to-severe cancer pain. There is low-certainty evidence that CBD does not add value to specialist palliative care alone in the reduction of pain in people with advanced cancer.","One person in two or three who gets cancer will have pain that becomes moderate or severe in intensity. The pain tends to get worse as the cancer progresses.
The WHO recommends taking morphine-like medicines for moderate-to-severe pain from cancer, but 1 in 6 to 10 people with cancer pain do not experience sufficient pain relief from morphine-like medicines. Several products based on the cannabis plant have been suggested as treatment for cancer pain. These products include inhaled or orally ingested herbal cannabis, and various oils, sprays or tablets containing active cannabis ingredients obtained from the plant, or made synthetically. Some people with cancer pain have reported that CbMs are effective for them, and that is often highlighted in the media.
If CbMs relieved cancer pain in people living with cancer.
If CbMs were associated with any unwanted or harmful effects.
We searched for clinical trials that examined CbMs compared to other medications to treat cancer pain in adults.
We summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as the methods and size of studies.
We found 14 studies involving 1823 people. The biggest study included 399 people and the smallest study included 10 people.
Studies were conducted in countries around the world; most (six) were based in North America.
Five studies used one dose of CbM and lasted less than one day. Other studies lasted between two and eight weeks.
Pharmaceutical companies funded seven studies.
Six studies compared a mouth spray with a plant-derived combination of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the principal psychoactive constituent of cannabis, and cannabidiol (CBD), an anti-inflammatory ingredient of cannabis, against a fake medication (placebo). Seven studies compared an artificial cannabinoid mimicking the effects of THC against placebo. Of these seven studies, two studies compared against a morphine-like medication (codeine), too. One study compared CBD against placebo.
We did not find studies with herbal cannabis.
Mouth spray with a plant-derived combination of THC and CBD was probably not better than placebo in reducing pain in people with moderate-to-severe cancer pain despite opioid treatment. Thirty-two out of 100 people reported to be much or very much improved by cannabis-based mouth spray and 23 out of 100 people with mouth spray with placebo. A total of 19 out of 100 people withdrew early because of side effects by cannabis-based mouth spray and 16 out of 100 people by mouth spray with placebo. There was no difference in serious side effects between the cannabis-based mouth spray and a placebo mouth spray.
Artificial cannabinoid mimicking the effects of THC may not be better than a fake medication in reducing pain associated with chemotherapy or radiochemotherapy in people with head and neck cancer and a certain type of lung cancer.
A single dose of an artificial cannabinoid mimicking the effects of THC may be better than a single dose of placebo, but may not differ from a single small dose of a morphine-like medication in reducing moderate-to-severe cancer pain after cessation of previous analgesic treatment for three to four and a half hours.
CBD may not add value to specialist palliative care alone in the reduction of pain in people with advanced cancer.
We found no studies with medical cannabis.
We are moderately confident in the evidence that a mouth spray with a plant-derived combination of THC and CBD does not reduce severe cancer pain despite opioid treatment because studies did not provide information about everything that we could have used.
We have little confidence in the evidence that an artificial cannabinoid mimicking the effects of THC (nabilone) does not reduce pain associated with chemotherapy or radiochemotherapy because the studies did not provide data about everything that we could have used, and because the studies were small.
We have little confidence in the evidence that artificial cannabinoids mimicking the effects of THC reduce cancer pain after the previous pain-relieving medication was stopped some hours before because the studies did not provide data about everything that we could have used, and because the studies were small.
We have little confidence in the evidence that CBD added to standard palliative care does not reduce cancer pain because there was only one study available.",1016,Opioid-refractory; oromucosal nabiximols; tetrahydrocannabinol (THC); cannabidiol (CBD); patient global impression of change (PGIC); synthetic THC analogue; analgesic treatment; chemotherapy; radiochemotherapy; adverse events,How do the study results challenge the potential use of cannabis-based medicines as alternatives to opioids for cancer pain?,What was a key motivation for the study?,Select all of the following that are colors,What was the outcome of using a mouth spray with THC and CBD for cancer pain?,"In the study, how did artificial cannabinoids perform compared to codeine?",There is no strong evidence that CbMs offer superior pain relief to opioids.; CbMs consistently showed better results than placebo.; CbMs treatments are associated with fewer side effects than opioids.,There is no strong evidence that CbMs offer superior pain relief to opioids.,To determine the effectiveness of CbMs in cancer pain relief.; To find new synthetic drugs for cancer treatment.; To evaluate the cost of cancer treatments.,To determine the effectiveness of CbMs in cancer pain relief.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,It was more effective than placebo.; It did not show significant improvement over placebo.; It cured the pain completely.,It did not show significant improvement over placebo.,They were superior in reducing pain.; They showed no difference in pain reduction.; They were less effective than codeine.,They showed no difference in pain reduction.
655f95ffd90905e27c938a49,interactive_4,Degarelix for newly diagnosed advanced prostate cancer,"Degarelix is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist that leads to medical castration used to treat men with advanced or metastatic prostate cancer, or both. It is unclear how its effects compare to standard androgen suppression therapy. We assessed the effects of degarelix compared with standard androgen suppression therapy for men with advanced hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. We searched multiple databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, LILACS until September 2020), trial registries (until October 2020), and conference proceedings (until December 2020). We identified other potentially eligible trials by reference checking, citation searching, and contacting study authors. We included randomized controlled trials comparing degarelix with standard androgen suppression therapy for men with advanced prostate cancer. Three review authors independently classified studies and abstracted data from the included studies. The primary outcomes were overall survival and serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes were quality of life, cancer-specific survival, clinical progression, other adverse events, and biochemical progression. We used a random-effects model for meta-analyses and assessed the certainty of evidence for the main outcomes according to GRADE. We included 11 studies with a follow-up of between three and 14 months. We also identified five ongoing trials. Data to evaluate overall survival were not available. Degarelix may result in little to no difference in serious adverse events compared to standard androgen suppression therapy (risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 1.05; low-certainty evidence; 2750 participants). Based on 114 serious adverse events in the standard androgen suppression group, this corresponds to 23 fewer serious adverse events per 1000 participants (43 fewer to 6 more). We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations and imprecision. Degarelix likely results in little to no difference in quality of life assessed with a variety of validated questionnaires (standardized mean difference 0.06 higher, 95% CI 0.05 lower to 0.18 higher; moderate-certainty evidence; 2887 participants), with higher scores reflecting better quality of life. We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations. Data to evaluate cancer-specific survival were not available. The effects of degarelix on cardiovascular events are very uncertain (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.61; very low-certainty evidence; 80 participants). We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations, imprecision, and indirectness as this trial was conducted in a unique group of high-risk participants with pre-existing cardiovascular morbidities. Degarelix likely results in an increase in injection site pain (RR 15.68, 95% CI 7.41 to 33.17; moderate-certainty evidence; 2670 participants). Based on 30 participants per 1000 with injection site pain with standard androgen suppression therapy, this corresponds to 440 more injection site pains per 1000 participants (192 more to 965 more). We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations. We did not identify any relevant subgroup differences for different degarelix maintenance doses. We did not find trial evidence for overall survival or cancer-specific survival comparing degarelix to standard androgen suppression, but serious adverse events and quality of life may be similar between groups. The effects of degarelix on cardiovascular events are very uncertain as the only eligible study had limitations, was small with few events, and was conducted in a high-risk population. Degarelix likely results in an increase in injection site pain compared to standard androgen suppression therapy. Maximum follow-up of included studies was 14 months, which is short. There is a need for methodologically better designed and executed studies with long-term follow-up evaluating men with metastatic prostate cancer.","How does degarelix, a newer drug that treats prostate cancer by lowering male sex hormone levels, compare to existing medications for newly diagnosed advanced prostate cancer? There is no cure if prostate cancer has spread outside of the prostate gland to lymph nodes or to the bones. In such a situation, hormonal therapy that lowers levels of the male sex hormone testosterone can slow down cancer growth. Testosterone levels are regulated by complicated mechanisms that involve a hormone known as gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which is present in men at different levels at different times of the day. It is understood that giving men with prostate cancer high levels of medications that increase GnRH levels first raises testosterone levels, and then drops them to very low levels. These medications are commonly used to treat men with prostate cancer that has spread outside the prostate. Degarelix is a newer drug known as a GnRH antagonist, which blocks receptors in the brain and thereby lowers testosterone levels immediately. We included randomized controlled trials (studies in which participants are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) comparing degarelix and standard hormonal therapy in men with newly diagnosed advanced prostate cancer. The evidence is current to September 2020 for electronic databases, to October 2020 for trial registries, and to December 2020 for conference proceedings. We found 11 studies that were eligible for inclusion in the review, but none of these studies evaluated the risk of dying from any cause or dying from prostate cancer. There may be no difference between degarelix and standard hormonal therapy in serious unwanted effects and quality of life. The effects of degarelix on cardiovascular issues such as the risk of a heart attack or stroke are uncertain; while one study suggested that the risk may be reduced with degarelix, it had major issues, in particular that it was conducted in men at high risk for such problems. We found that degarelix therapy likely results in an increase in the occurrence of pain at the injection site. The certainty of evidence for the various outcomes ranged from moderate to very low. There is a need for additional, better designed studies to further understand the effects of degarelix for newly diagnosed advanced prostate cancer.",1024,Degarelix; gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist; androgen suppression therapy; metastatic prostate cancer; hormone-sensitive prostate cancer; overall survival; serious adverse events; quality of life; cancer-specific survival; cardiovascular events,How does the evidence regarding cardiovascular events influence the current understanding of degarelix compared to standard therapy?,What could improve the reliability of outcomes related to quality of life in future studies with degarelix?,Select all of the following that are fruits,How do the study's conclusions address the balance between serious adverse events and quality of life?,Which type of prostate cancer was the focus of the study comparing degarelix with standard therapy?,The evidence suggests a reduced risk with degarelix due to lower event rates in standard therapy.; The evidence is inconclusive due to study limitations and focus on high-risk populations.; The evidence supports degarelix as a preferable treatment for all patients because of fewer cardiac events.,The evidence is inconclusive due to study limitations and focus on high-risk populations.,Using a single standardized questionnaire for all studies.; Ensuring consistent data collection methods across studies.; Focusing on quality of life outcomes only in high-risk participant trials.,Ensuring consistent data collection methods across studies.,dog; blue; grape,grape,"The study concludes that there is little difference, suggesting similar benefit-risk profiles.; The conclusions indicate that degarelix has significantly fewer adverse events but similar quality of life.; It concludes that standard therapy provides better outcomes for quality of life but with more adverse events.","The study concludes that there is little difference, suggesting similar benefit-risk profiles.",Newly diagnosed advanced prostate cancer; Localized prostate cancer; Hormone-refractory prostate cancer,Newly diagnosed advanced prostate cancer

Various types of exercise have shown beneficial effects. While previous systematic reviews suggest exercise may improve CRF and quality of life, evidence specifically about yoga's impact, as well as evidence on long-term effects, is limited. Previous syntheses offer promising but inconclusive findings on yoga's effectiveness. This review is one of a suite of five reviews exploring exercise for cancer-related fatigue.
To assess the effects of yoga versus no yoga on cancer-related fatigue in people with cancer: before, during, and after anticancer treatment; in the short, medium, and long term; and effects on quality of life (QoL), adverse events, depression, and anxiety.
We used CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, five other databases and two trials registers, together with reference checking, citation searching and contact with study authors to identify studies that are included in the review. The latest search date was October 2023.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing yoga to no yoga. We included studies in adults (aged 18 and older) with any type of cancer and anticancer therapy who received yoga before, during, or after anticancer therapy. We included trials evaluating at least one of the main outcomes (CRF or QoL). Yoga had to last for at least five sessions, and involve face-to-face instruction. We excluded trials with fewer than 20 participants randomised per group.
The outcomes of interest in this review are cancer-related fatigue (CRF), quality of life (QoL), adverse events, depression, and anxiety. We used standard methods expected by Cochrane. For analyses, we pooled results within the same period of outcome assessment (i.e. short, medium, and long term), and employed a random-effects model. We assessed risk of bias with the Cochrane risk of bias (RoB) 1 tool, and used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence.
We included 21 RCTs with 2041 people with cancer who received yoga during (13 studies) or after (eight studies) anticancer therapy; none examined yoga initiated before therapy. Here we present results on CRF and QoL; findings on adverse events, depression, and anxiety are in the full review. Yoga during anticancer therapy The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of yoga compared to no yoga on: short-term CRF (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.18 to 0.32; mean difference (MD) on Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI; lower values mean better outcome) of 0.16, 95% CI -0.41 to 0.71; 3 studies, 253 participants); medium-term CRF (MD on Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI; lower values mean better outcome) of -1.30, 95% CI -3.50 to 0.90; 1 study, 67 participants); and long-term CRF (MD 0.09 on BFI, 95% CI 1.16 to 0.98; 2 studies, 155 participants) (all very low-certainty evidence). Yoga may have a small beneficial effect or no effect compared to no yoga on short-term QoL (SMD 0.25, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.45; MD on Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30 (QLQ-C30; higher values mean better outcome) of 5.28, 95% CI 0.84 to 9.56; 4 studies, 374 participants) and medium-term QoL (MD on QLQ-C30 of 7.63, 95% CI 6.71 to 21.97; 2 studies, 151 participants), but the evidence is very uncertain (all very low-certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported long-term QoL. Yoga after anticancer therapy Yoga probably has a beneficial effect compared to no yoga on short-term CRF (SMD -0.26, 95% CI -0.42 to -0.09; MD 2.55, 95% CI 0.88 to 4.12; higher values mean better outcome; 5 studies, 602 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Yoga might have a beneficial effect or no effect compared to no yoga on medium-term CRF, but the evidence is very uncertain (MD 3.02, 95% CI -1.48 to 7.52; 1 study, 54 participants (higher values mean better outcome; very low-certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported long-term CRF. Yoga may have a small beneficial effect or no effect compared to no yoga on short-term QoL (SMD 0.19, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.47; MD -3.27, 95% CI -8.08 to 1.55; higher values mean better outcome; 4 studies, 275 participants) and medium term QoL (MD 7.06, 95% CI -1.38 to 15.50; 1 study, 54 participants; higher values mean better outcome), but the evidence is very uncertain (all very low-certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported long-term QoL. A key limitation of the review was the included studies' methodological constraints: participants' awareness of treatment assignments (yoga or control) potentially introduced bias. Additionally, sample sizes were too small to determine medium- and long-term effects conclusively. Further research is needed to evaluate the sustainability of yoga's impact on cancer-related fatigue, quality of life, and adverse events.
Our review provides uncertain evidence of the beneficial effects of yoga initiated during or after anticancer therapy compared to no yoga for people with cancer. Although there are indications supporting the use of yoga to address CRF, the uncertainty of the evidence underscores the need for caution in its implementation. Future RCTs should employ rigorous methodologies, enroll sufficient participants, and use appropriate controls.","Cancer-related fatigue is a feeling of extreme tiredness that lasts for a long time. It can be caused by cancer, cancer therapy, or both. Cancer-related fatigue affects the body and mood and makes it hard to perform regular activities. It is stronger than just being tired and does not go away by resting. Clinical guidelines recommend physical exercise to improve cancer-related fatigue. Physical exercise affects cancer-related fatigue by influencing biological and psychological processes, but it is unclear what types of exercise may be most beneficial. Yoga may reduce cancer-related fatigue and improve quality of life because it combines physical movement with breath control, mental focus, and body awareness. This review explored whether yoga improves cancer-related fatigue and quality of life in adults. We also examined whether any adverse events occurred in the studies. We investigated short-term (up to 12 weeks), medium-term (12 weeks to 6 months), and long-term (more than 6 months) effects. We searched for studies comparing yoga with no yoga in adults with any cancer, including yoga done before, during, or after anticancer therapy. Multiple types of yoga were included, such as Hatha and Dru yoga. We compared and summarised the results, assessed study quality, and considered differences based on type of yoga, cancer type, format of exercise (group vs individual; supervised vs unsupervised), and participant age. We found 21 studies involving 2041 participants with various cancers, mostly women with breast cancer. Yoga was initiated during anticancer therapy in 13 studies and after therapy in eight studies; no studies examined yoga before treatment. It is unclear whether yoga during anticancer therapy improves short, medium, or long-term cancer-related fatigue. Yoga during therapy may increase short- and medium-term quality of life, but the evidence is very uncertain, and no studies measured long-term quality of life. Only one study reported adverse events, so it is unclear whether yoga affects safety outcomes. No meaningful differences were found between different yoga types, training formats, supervision levels, or cancer types. Yoga after anticancer therapy probably reduces short-term cancer-related fatigue, but its effects on medium-term fatigue are unclear, and long-term fatigue was not measured. Yoga after therapy may slightly increase short and medium-term quality of life, but evidence is very uncertain, and long-term outcomes were not assessed. It is also unclear whether yoga after therapy leads to adverse events, and no differences were found between yoga types, cancer types, or age groups. Limitations include lack of blinding, which may influence results, and small or insufficiently long studies for several outcomes. More research is needed to determine how sustainable the effects of yoga are on cancer-related fatigue, quality of life, and adverse events.",1014,Cancer-related fatigue; anticancer therapy; quality of life; adverse events; Brief Fatigue Inventory; Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory; Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30,What factors were examined to assess study quality and differences in yoga's effects?,What is the potential impact of yoga on medium-term quality of life for cancer patients?,Select the items that are animals,What was the primary focus of the study reviewed in the plain-language summary?,What uncertainty is highlighted in the evidence regarding yoga's effect on quality of life during anticancer therapy?,"Type of yoga, format of exercise, and participant age; Geographic location of studies; Financial support of participants","Type of yoga, format of exercise, and participant age",The impact is unclear due to very uncertain evidence; There is a definite significant improvement; It consistently decreases quality of life,The impact is unclear due to very uncertain evidence,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,To compare the effects of different types of yoga on weight loss; To assess the impact of yoga on cancer-related fatigue and quality of life; To examine dietary interventions for cancer patients,To assess the impact of yoga on cancer-related fatigue and quality of life,No studies assessed long-term quality of life; Yoga significantly decreases quality of life; Certainty of increased short- and medium-term quality of life,No studies assessed long-term quality of life
655f95ffd90905e27c938a49,finetuned_5,What are the benefits and risks of vaccines for preventing COVID-19?,"Different forms of vaccines have been developed to prevent the SARS-CoV-2 virus and subsequent COVID-19 disease, and several are in widespread global use. The objective was to assess the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines, whether as a full primary series or booster dose, against SARS-CoV-2. We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and the COVID-19 LOVE platform (last search 5 November 2021), as well as the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, regulatory agency websites, and Retraction Watch. We included randomized controlled trials comparing COVID-19 vaccines with placebo, no vaccine, other active vaccines, or other vaccine schedules. Using standard Cochrane methods and GRADE for all outcomes except immunogenicity, we synthesized data for each vaccine separately and presented summary effect estimates with 95% confidence intervals. We included 41 RCTs assessing 12 vaccines, including homologous and heterologous schedules and booster doses; 32 were multicentre and five were multinational, with sample sizes ranging from 60 to 44,325 participants. Participants were aged 18 years or older in 36 RCTs, 12 years or older in one, 12 to 17 years in two, and three to 17 years in two; 29 trials included people over 60, three included immunocompromized patients, and none included pregnant women. Follow-up was ? two months in 16 RCTs, two to six months in 20, and > six to 12 months in five; 18 were preplanned interim analyses. Overall risk of bias was low for all outcomes in eight RCTs, while 33 had concerns for at least one outcome. We identified 343 registered RCTs with unavailable results. This abstract reports results for symptomatic COVID-19, severe/critical COVID-19, and serious adverse events for the 10 WHO-approved vaccines. Evidence for mortality was sparse and low or very low certainty for all vaccines except AD26.COV2.S (Janssen), which probably reduces all-cause mortality (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.67; 1 RCT, 43,783 participants; high-certainty evidence). High-certainty evidence shows that BNT162b2 (Pfizer), mRNA-1273 (Moderna), ChAdOx1 (AstraZeneca), Ad26.COV2.S, BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm-Beijing), and BBV152 (Bharat Biotech) reduce symptomatic COVID-19 compared with placebo, with vaccine efficacy ranging from about 66% to over 97% based on multiple trials. Moderate-certainty evidence shows that NVX-CoV2373 (Novavax) probably reduces symptomatic infection, while CoronaVac (Sinovac) has low-certainty evidence due to heterogeneity between its two trials. For severe or critical COVID-19, high-certainty evidence indicates that BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, Ad26.COV2.S, and BBV152 produce large reductions in severe disease, with efficacy estimates ranging from about 76% to over 98%; NVX-CoV2373 probably reduces severe disease; and two CoronaVac trials reported high efficacy but could not be pooled. For serious adverse events, mRNA-1273, ChAdOx1/SII-ChAdOx1, Ad26.COV2.S, and BBV152 probably result in little or no difference compared with placebo (RRs ranging from 0.65 to 0.92), with absolute differences fewer than 5 per 1000 participants. Evidence for SAEs is uncertain for BNT162b2, CoronaVac, BBIBP-CorV, and NVX-CoV2373 due to wide confidence intervals and low event counts. For heterologous schedules, boosters, and variant-specific efficacy, see the full review. Compared with placebo, most vaccines reduce or likely reduce symptomatic COVID-19, and several show high-certainty reductions in severe or critical disease, with probably little or no difference in serious adverse events. Over 300 registered RCTs continue to evaluate COVID-19 vaccines, and this review is regularly updated on the COVID-NMA platform. Due to trial exclusions, results cannot be generalized to pregnant women, individuals with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, or immunocompromized people; most trials had short follow-up and occurred before variants of concern emerged. Future research should evaluate long-term effects, compare vaccines and schedules, assess efficacy and safety in specific populations, include outcomes such as preventing long COVID-19, and continually monitor protection against emerging variants.","SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) is the virus that causes COVID-19 disease, and not everyone infected will develop symptoms, which can range from mild (such as fever and headaches) to life-threatening (such as difficulty breathing), or death. While vaccines work slightly differently, they all prepare the body's immune system to prevent people from getting infected with SARS-CoV-2 or, if they do get infected, to prevent severe disease. We wanted to find out how well each vaccine works in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection, symptomatic COVID-19, severe COVID-19 disease, and total deaths (including any cause), as well as serious adverse events requiring hospitalization or being life-threatening, systemic reactogenicity events (short-term immunological reactions like fever, headache, body aches, and fatigue), and any adverse events including non-serious ones. We searched for studies examining any COVID-19 vaccine compared with placebo, no vaccine, or another COVID-19 vaccine, selecting only randomized trials that evaluate interventions under ideal conditions among participants assigned by chance to different groups, and we summarized results and rated our confidence in the evidence based on study conduct. We found 41 worldwide studies involving 433,838 people assessing 12 vaccines; 35 included only healthy people who had never had COVID-19, 36 included only adults, two only adolescents, two children and adolescents, and one adolescents and adults; three involved people with weakened immune systems, and none involved pregnant women. Most studies assessed results less than six months after primary vaccination, most received co-funding from academic institutions and pharmaceutical companies, most compared a COVID-19 vaccine with placebo, and five evaluated a 'mix and match' booster. We report results for three main outcomes and for 10 WHO-approved vaccines: there is insufficient evidence regarding deaths between vaccines and placebo except for the Janssen vaccine, which probably reduces all-cause deaths. The Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Sinopharm-Beijing, and Bharat vaccines produce a large reduction in symptomatic COVID-19, Janssen reduces symptomatic cases, Novavax probably produces a large reduction, and CoronaVac has insufficient evidence because results differed between its two studies. For severe disease, Pfizer, Moderna, Janssen, and Bharat produce a large reduction, while evidence for CoronaVac is insufficient due to differing study results. For serious adverse events, Pfizer, CoronaVac, Sinopharm-Beijing, and Novavax have insufficient evidence due to low numbers of events, while Moderna, AstraZeneca, Janssen, and Bharat probably result in no or little difference in serious adverse events. Most studies assessed vaccines for a short time after injection, making it unclear how protection wanes over time; exclusion criteria limit generalizability to pregnant women, people with prior infection, and those with weakened immune systems; more research is needed comparing vaccines, schedules, effectiveness, and safety in specific populations and outcomes such as preventing long COVID-19; and most studies were conducted before variants of concern emerged.",1110,COVID-19 vaccines; placebo; vaccine efficacy; homologous schedules; heterologous schedules; booster doses; symptomatic COVID-19; severe/critical COVID-19; serious adverse events; variants of concern,What are the implications of the short follow-up period noted in many studies regarding vaccine efficacy?,How could future research be designed to improve understanding of vaccine performance against emerging variants?,Select the items that are animals,What reasoning supports the conclusion that most vaccines probably reduce severe COVID-19 disease?,"How did the results of CoronaVac differ between the two trials, and why is this significant?",Long-term effectiveness might be underestimated due to short follow-up.; Short follow-up guarantees accurate assessment of immediate adverse events.; It provides a comprehensive view of vaccine efficacy against emerging variants.,Long-term effectiveness might be underestimated due to short follow-up.,Incorporating diverse geographic regions where variants are spreading rapidly.; Limiting studies to specific age groups already well-researched in past studies.; Extending the study duration to capture changes in variant prevalence.,Incorporating diverse geographic regions where variants are spreading rapidly.; Extending the study duration to capture changes in variant prevalence.,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,High-certainty evidence from multiple trials demonstrating efficacy in severe disease prevention.; Uniform efficacy rates observed across all studied vaccines.; Consistent reduction in hospitalization rates in the vaccinated groups.,High-certainty evidence from multiple trials demonstrating efficacy in severe disease prevention.; Consistent reduction in hospitalization rates in the vaccinated groups.,"The trials demonstrated contradictory efficacy results, complicating overall interpretation.; Both trials showed identical efficacy against severe COVID-19.; The results highlighted a varying immune response across different populations.","The trials demonstrated contradictory efficacy results, complicating overall interpretation.; The results highlighted a varying immune response across different populations."
655f95ffd90905e27c938a49,finetuned_6,Biosimilar monoclonal antibodies for cancer treatment in adults,"Biosimilars are products that contain an approved biological medicine and are similar, but not identical, to the original version (the originator). In cancer, biosimilars have been developed from the monoclonal antibodies bevacizumab, rituximab, and trastuzumab, and they are now available for treating lung, colorectal, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and breast cancers. Because biological products cannot be made identically, it is important to evaluate the clinical effects of biosimilars compared with their originators to understand their benefits and harms. We evaluated the benefits and harms of biosimilar monoclonal antibodies versus their originators in adults with cancer. We searched major medical and clinical trial databases up to February 2024 for randomized controlled trials comparing biosimilars to originators. Standard Cochrane methods were used. The primary outcomes were progression-free survival, duration of response, overall survival, pathological complete response in breast cancer, serious adverse events, and health-related quality of life. We included 55 studies with 22,046 adults: 23 studies of bevacizumab involving 10,639 participants with colorectal or lung cancer, 17 studies of rituximab involving 4412 participants with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 15 studies of trastuzumab involving 6995 participants with breast cancer. Studies took place worldwide, were mostly multicentre, and all were funded by manufacturers. Participants ranged in age from 47 to 62 years, and the percentage of women ranged from 18% to 100%. Fifteen studies used non-inferiority designs and 40 used equivalence designs. Overall risk of bias was low, with most concerns related to incomplete outcome data and selective reporting. For bevacizumab in lung or colorectal cancer, progression-free survival was likely similar between biosimilars and originators, with equal numbers per 1000 at 12 months and a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.00. Duration of response and overall survival were also likely similar, and serious adverse events showed no important differences. Health-related quality of life was evaluated in only one colorectal cancer study and results were similar. Objective response and mortality were likely similar as well. For rituximab in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, biosimilars were likely similar to originators for progression-free survival, duration of response, overall survival, serious adverse events, objective response, and mortality. No studies reported quality of life. For trastuzumab in breast cancer, biosimilars were likely similar to originators for progression-free survival, duration of response, overall survival, serious adverse events, and objective response, and may be similar for pathological complete response. No studies reported quality of life. Across bevacizumab, rituximab, and trastuzumab, biosimilars were generally similar to their originators in progression-free survival, duration of response, overall survival, serious adverse events, objective response, and mortality. Evidence for pathological complete response (trastuzumab) and quality of life (bevacizumab) was limited. Overall, evidence certainty was moderate, with imprecision being the main reason for downgrading confidence.","Biological medicines used in cancer treatment are made from living organisms and work by killing cancer cells. Biosimilars are medicines that are similar to the original biological medicine, known as the originator. Although biosimilars have slightly different structures, they target cancer cells in the same way. Originator medicines, sometimes called reference or innovator medicines, receive approval before biosimilars. Unlike generic medicines, which are chemically derived and easier to replicate, originators and biosimilars are biological medicines, making it more difficult to create identical copies. However, biosimilars are often cheaper and could improve access to effective cancer treatment if they provide similar benefits and harms. We wanted to compare the benefits and harms of bevacizumab, rituximab, and trastuzumab biosimilars with their originators. Based on the input from five people with cancer, we considered several outcomes critical for clinical decisions: the length of time cancer does not grow or spread after treatment, the length of time people remain cancer-free, overall survival, the number of people whose breast cancer disappears in tissue removed during surgery, severe unwanted effects, and well-being. We also identified outcomes important for decision-making: the number of people whose cancer shrinks or disappears, death, and the time until cancer grows or spreads or until death. We searched for studies comparing biosimilars of bevacizumab, rituximab, or trastuzumab with the originators in people with lung, colorectal, non-Hodkin's lymphoma, and breast cancers, summarized the results, and rated our confidence in the evidence. We found 55 studies with 22,046 participants, including 10,639 receiving bevacizumab for advanced or metastatic lung cancer, 4412 receiving rituximab mainly for non-Hodkin's lymphoma, and 6995 receiving trastuzumab for advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Participants were 47 to 62 years old on average, and the studies took place across Asia, Europe, and North and South America. All studies were funded by the companies manufacturing the biosimilars. Receiving biosimilars or originator medicines led to similar results overall, and we are moderately confident that biosimilars are as effective as the originators in treating cancer. We set narrow criteria to judge whether results were sufficiently similar, and while most comparisons did not fall fully within this range, overall findings still support similarity. Most studies were well conducted, but a few may have allowed participants to know which treatment they received, and some studies did not report all outcomes of interest.",1018,biosilimars; biological medicine; bevacizumab; rituximab; trastuzumab; progression-free survival; duration of response; overall survival; serious adverse events; health-related quality of life,In what way do biosimilars demonstrate their therapeutic value compared to originators?,How could a decision-maker justify the use of biosimilars in cancer treatment?,Select all of the following that are colors,Name the three monoclonal antibodies mentioned that have biosimilars.,Describe the types of cancer involved in the studies comparing biosimilars and originators.,By showing adequately similar outcomes in critical measures for decision-making.; By providing completely different benefits that improve treatment options.; By achieving perfect replication of all outcomes observed with originators.,By showing adequately similar outcomes in critical measures for decision-making.,By arguing that biosimilars provide a moderate increase in life expectancy.; By highlighting their overall similar effectiveness and lower cost.; By pointing to their identical molecular composition to originators.,By highlighting their overall similar effectiveness and lower cost.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Bevacizumab; Rituximab; Trastuzumab,Bevacizumab; Rituximab; Trastuzumab,"Lung, colorectal, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and breast cancers.; Prostate and skin cancers.; Bone and stomach cancers.","Lung, colorectal, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and breast cancers."
655f95ffd90905e27c938a49,finetuned_6,How accurate are alternative laboratory-based molecular tests (to RT-PCR with prior RNA extraction/purification) for identifying people infected by SARS-CoV-2?,"Diagnosing people with a SARS-CoV-2 infection played a critical role in managing the COVID-19 pandemic and remains a priority for the transition to long-term management of COVID-19. Initial shortages of extraction and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) reagents impaired the desired upscaling of testing in many countries, which led to the search for alternatives to RNA extraction/purification and RT-PCR testing. Reference standard methods for diagnosing the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection rely primarily on real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Alternatives to RT-PCR could, if sufficiently accurate, have a positive impact by expanding the range of diagnostic tools available for the timely identification of people infected by SARS-CoV-2, access to testing and the use of resources. We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of alternative (to RT-PCR assays) laboratory-based molecular tests for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection. We searched the COVID-19 Open Access Project living evidence database from the University of Bern until 30 September 2020 and the WHO COVID-19 Research Database until 31 October 2022, with no language restrictions. We included studies of people with suspected or known SARS-CoV-2 infection, or where tests were used to screen for infection, and studies evaluating commercially developed laboratory-based molecular tests for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection considered as alternatives to RT-PCR testing, and we included all reference standards to define the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2, including RT-PCR tests and established clinical diagnostic criteria. Two authors independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and applicability using the QUADAS-2 tool. We presented sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals for each test using paired forest plots and summarised results using average sensitivity and specificity with a bivariate random-effects meta-analysis, illustrating the findings per index test category and assay brand compared to the WHO's acceptable sensitivity and specificity thresholds for nucleic acid tests. We included data from 64 studies reporting 94 cohorts of participants and 105 index test evaluations, with 74,753 samples and 7517 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases. We did not identify any published or preprint reports of accuracy for a considerable number of commercially produced NAAT assays. Most cohorts were judged at unclear or high risk of bias in more than three QUADAS-2 domains; around half were at high risk of selection bias because of recruitment based on COVID status; and three quarters were at high risk of bias in the reference standard domain due to reliance on a single RT-PCR result or unclear diagnostic timing, missing results, or absent participant flow diagrams. For test categories with four or more evaluations allowing summary estimates, RT-PCR assays designed to omit/adapt RNA extraction/purification had average sensitivity of 95.1% (95% CI 91.1% to 97.3%) and specificity of 99.7% (95% CI 98.5% to 99.9%; 27 evaluations, 2834 samples and 1178 cases); RT-LAMP assays had average sensitivity of 88.4% (95% CI 83.1% to 92.2%) and specificity of 99.7% (95% CI 98.7% to 99.9%; 24 evaluations, 29,496 samples and 2255 cases); TMA assays had average sensitivity of 97.6% (95% CI 95.2% to 98.8%) and specificity of 99.4% (95% CI 94.9% to 99.9%; 14 evaluations, 2196 samples and 942 cases); digital PCR assays had average sensitivity of 98.5% (95% CI 95.2% to 99.5%) and specificity of 91.4% (95% CI 60.4% to 98.7%; 5 evaluations, 703 samples and 354 cases); RT-LAMP assays omitting/adapting RNA extraction had average sensitivity of 73.1% (95% CI 58.4% to 84%) and specificity of 100% (95% CI 98% to 100%; 24 evaluations, 14,342 samples and 1502 cases). Only two index categories fulfilled WHO-acceptable requirements: RT-PCR assays designed to omit/adapt RNA extraction/purification and TMA assays. At 5% prevalence in a cohort of 1000 people, the positive predictive value of RT-PCR assays omitting/adapting extraction is 94%, with three false positives among 51 positive results and about two missed cases; for TMA assays, positive predictive value is 89%, with six false positives among 55 positive results and around one missed case. Alternative laboratory-based molecular tests aim to enhance testing capacity by reducing time, steps, and resource requirements. Several technologies with potential advantages have not been evaluated or were assessed by few low-quality studies, so performance remains undetermined. Only RT-PCR assays designed to omit/adapt RNA extraction/purification and TMA assays fulfil WHO accuracy standards and may be suitable alternatives when RT-PCR is inaccessible. However, findings must be interpreted with caution due to limitations, including reliance on retrospective samples without symptom information, dominant representation of specific high-performing brands (21/26 and 12/14 studies), and methodological weaknesses. Although we used comprehensive searches and broad inclusion criteria, further research is needed to evaluate alternative COVID-19 tests and their role in pandemic management.","Laboratory-based molecular assays (tests) aim to confirm or rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection in people. Alternatives to RT-PCR assays have been developed to minimise the steps needed to process samples in the laboratory or use fewer resources to obtain the same valid results. For this review, we focus on tests commercially developed by a manufacturer, providing instructions for their professional use. People with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection should know if they are infected to self-isolate, receive treatment, and inform close contacts. Failure to detect SARS-CoV-2 when it is present risks spreading infection and results in missed opportunities for prevention. Diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection when it is not present may lead to unnecessary self-isolation and testing of close contacts. Currently, testing to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection relies on a laboratory molecular test called RT-PCR. This requires specialist equipment and can take 24 hours to produce a result. If assays that take less time or use readily available resources were sufficiently accurate to replace RT-PCR testing, this could increase the number of tests that could be done, allow faster diagnosis and enable people to take appropriate action more quickly. We wanted to know whether commercially developed, alternative laboratory-based molecular tests are accurate enough to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to RT-PCR. We looked for studies investigating these tests in people (or samples) that were also tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection using RT-PCR which modified RT-PCR by removing or altering components of this testing process. We included 105 evaluations evaluating alternatives to RT-PCR in the review. The main results are based on 74,753 samples, and SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed in 7517 of these samples. Most evaluations (27/105) concerned various test types specifically designed to omit/adapt RNA extraction/purification. Twenty-four of 105 evaluations concerned various test types operating at one temperature (isothermal tests) rather than cycling through different temperatures. Twenty-four of 105 evaluations were concerned with various test types that combined these two alternative approaches. Only tests specifically designed to omit/adapt RNA extraction/purification and TMA assays with RNA extraction (a type of isothermal test) met WHO-acceptable standards for confirming and ruling out SARS-CoV-2. For illustration, the results of these studies indicate that in a group of 1000 people, 50 of whom (5%) actually have SARS-CoV-2: for tests specifically designed to omit/adapt RNA extraction/purification, 51 people would test positive for SARS-CoV-2, of these, three people (6%) would not have SARS-CoV-2 (false-positive result), and 949 people would test negative for SARS-CoV-2, of these, two people (0.2%) would actually have SARS-CoV-2 (false-negative result); for TMA tests with RNA extraction, 55 people would test positive for SARS-CoV-2, of these, six people (10%) would not have SARS-CoV-2 (false-positive result), and 945 people would test negative for SARS-CoV-2, of these, one person (0.1%) would actually have SARS-CoV-2 (false-negative result). Most included studies did not provide information on participants who underwent testing, such as whether they had symptoms or were close contacts of a SARS-CoV-2 case. We also had concerns about the method of recruiting participants for the majority of included studies, which may have resulted in an overestimation of the accuracy of these methods. In addition, the method used to determine whether individuals did not have SARS-CoV-2 infection was not considered reliable for most studies, which may have resulted in underestimating the accuracy of these methods. Some studies did not follow the manufacturers' instructions for using the test. Results from different test brands using the same technique varied. The studies included in this review suggest that two laboratory-based molecular tests might be accurate enough to replace or supplement RT-PCR tests with prior RNA extraction/purification for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection: RT-PCR tests developed to omit or adapt RNA extraction or purification and TMA isothermal tests (retaining an RNA extraction step). Other alternative tests to RT-PCR were assessed just by a few studies of limited methodological quality, and their performance should be evaluated by additional studies. Furthermore, data in these studies mostly relied on samples acquired in the past (compared to current or future samples), thus further evaluation of these tests in real clinical practice scenarios is required. Also, decisions on the optimal test for a specific setting will be driven not only by diagnostic accuracy, but also by other factors such as test complexity, time to result, acceptability to those being tested, and the setting in which the tests are to be used.",1112,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
606cf604adbb6982bb382881,static_1,Antidepressants for prevention of winter depression,"Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a seasonal pattern of recurrent major depressive episodes that most commonly occurs during autumn or winter and remits in spring. The prevalence of SAD ranges from 1.5% to 9%, depending on latitude. The predictable seasonal aspect of SAD provides a promising opportunity for prevention. This review - one of four reviews on efficacy and safety of interventions to prevent SAD - focuses on second-generation antidepressants (SGAs). To assess the efficacy and safety of SGAs (in comparison with other SGAs, placebo, light therapy, melatonin or agomelatine, psychological therapies or lifestyle interventions) in preventing SAD and improving patient-centred outcomes among adults with a history of SAD. We searched Ovid MEDLINE (1950- ), Embase (1974- ), PsycINFO (1967- ) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to 19 June 2018. An earlier search of these databases was conducted via the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trial Register (CCMD-CTR) (all years to 11 August 2015). Furthermore, we searched the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database and international trial registers (to 19 June 2018). We also conducted a grey literature search and handsearched the reference lists of included studies and pertinent review articles. For efficacy, we included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on adults with a history of winter-type SAD who were free of symptoms at the beginning of the study. For adverse events, we planned to include non-randomised studies. Eligible studies compared a SGA versus another SGA, placebo, light therapy, psychological therapy, melatonin, agomelatine or lifestyle changes. We also intended to compare SGAs in combination with any of the comparator interventions versus placebo or the same comparator intervention as monotherapy. Two review authors independently screened abstracts and full-text publications, extracted data and assessed risk of bias of included studies. When data were sufficient, we conducted random-effects (Mantel-Haenszel) meta-analyses. We assessed statistical heterogeneity by calculating the Chi2 statistic and the Cochran Q. We used the I2 statistic to estimate the magnitude of heterogeneity. We assessed publication bias by using funnel plots. We rated the strength of the evidence using the system developed by the GRADE Working Group. We identified 3745 citations after de-duplication of search results and excluded 3619 records during title and abstract reviews. We assessed 126 full-text papers for inclusion in the review, of which four publications (on three RCTs) providing data from 1100 people met eligibility criteria for this review. All three RCTs had methodological limitations due to high attrition rates. Overall, moderate-quality evidence indicates that bupropion XL is an efficacious intervention for prevention of recurrence of depressive episodes in people with a history of SAD (risk ratio (RR) 0.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 0.72; 3 RCTs, 1100 participants). However, bupropion XL leads to greater risk of headaches (moderate-quality evidence), insomnia and nausea (both low-quality evidence) when compared with placebo. Numbers needed to treat for additional beneficial outcomes (NNTBs) vary by baseline risks. For a population with a yearly recurrence rate of 30%, the NNTB is 8 (95% CI 6 to 12). For populations with yearly recurrence rates of 50% and 60%, NNTBs are 5 (95% CI 4 to 7) and 4 (95% CI 3 to 6), respectively. We could find no studies on other SGAs and no studies comparing SGAs with other interventions of interest, such as light therapy, psychological therapies, melatonin or agomelatine. Available evidence indicates that bupropion XL is an effective intervention for prevention of recurrence of SAD. Nevertheless, even in a high-risk population, three out of four people will not benefit from preventive treatment with bupropion XL and will be at risk for harm. Clinicians need to discuss with patients advantages and disadvantages of preventive SGA treatment, and might want to consider offering other potentially efficacious interventions, which might confer a lower risk of adverse events. Given the lack of comparative evidence, the decision for or against initiating preventive treatment of SAD and the treatment selected should be strongly based on patient preferences. Future researchers need to assess the effectiveness and risk of harms of SGAs other than bupropion for prevention of SAD. Investigators also need to compare benefits and harms of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions.","Why is this review important? Many people in northern latitudes suffer from winter blues, which occurs as a reaction to reduced sunlight. Three-quarters of those affected are women. Lethargy, overeating, craving for carbohydrates and depressed mood are common symptoms. In some people, winter blues becomes depression, which seriously affects their daily lives. Up to two-thirds experience depressive symptoms every winter. Who will be interested in this review? Anyone who has experienced winter depression. Relatives and friends of people who have experienced winter depression. General practitioners, psychiatrists and pharmacists.  Professionals working in adult mental health services. What questions does this review aim to answer? In light of the seasonal pattern and the high rate of recurrence, beginning antidepressant therapy in early autumn (fall) when people are still free of depressive symptoms can prevent the onset of depressed mood. The goal of this review is to examine whether benefits outweigh harms of antidepressants when they are used in healthy people with a history of winter depression to prevent onset of depression the next winter. To date, this question has not been examined in a systematic way. Which studies were included in the review? We searched databases up to June 2018 for studies on antidepressants given to prevent winter depression. Of 3745 records, we found three randomised controlled studies including 1100 people who received bupropion extended-release (only one of many available antidepressants, but the only one licensed for prevention of winter depression) or placebo. We found no studies on other antidepressants. What does evidence from the review reveal? In populations with a high risk of developing a new depressive episode in the next winter, results show that antidepressants can prevent winter depression in about one in four people. In populations with a lower risk of recurrence, antidepressants can prevent a new depressive episode in one of eight people. The other seven people suffer from winter depression despite treatment or would not have suffered from winter depression anyway. People using antidepressants are at slightly higher risk of experiencing headaches, nausea or insomnia when compared with people not taking antidepressants. Doctors need to discuss with patients the advantages and disadvantages of antidepressants and other potentially preventive treatments for winter depression, such as light treatment, psychological therapies or lifestyle interventions. As no available studies have compared these treatments, the decision for or against preventive treatment of SAD and the treatment selected should be strongly based on patient preferences. What should happen next? Review authors recommend that future studies should directly compare antidepressants against other treatments, such as light therapy, psychological therapies or other drugs to determine the best treatment for preventing winter depression.",1120,Seasonal affective disorder; second-generation antidepressants; bupropion XL; moderate-quality evidence; recurrence of depressive episodes; melatonin; agomelatine; psychological therapies; pharmacological interventions; non-pharmacological interventions,What inference can be made about the population that most benefits from bupropion XL in preventing winter depression?,How does the review suggest doctors should navigate treatment options for SAD?,Select all of the following that are fruits,What conclusion can be drawn about the comparative efficacy of bupropion XL versus other SGAs based on the review findings?,"In the review, which antidepressant was examined for preventing winter depression?",Populations with a yearly recurrence rate of 60%.; Patients who have never experienced depressive symptoms.; Individuals who are symptom-free during spring and summer.,Populations with a yearly recurrence rate of 60%.,By prioritizing drugs like bupropion XL over all other treatments.; By heavily considering patient preferences in treatment decisions.; By providing a one-size-fits-all treatment approach based on clinical guidelines.,By heavily considering patient preferences in treatment decisions.,dog; blue; grape,grape,Bupropion XL is the only SGA proven to prevent winter depression.; There is insufficient evidence to compare bupropion XL to other SGAs.; Other SGAs are less effective than bupropion XL.,There is insufficient evidence to compare bupropion XL to other SGAs.,Fluoxetine; Bupropion extended-release; Sertraline,Bupropion extended-release
606cf604adbb6982bb382881,static_2,Is liraglutide an effective weight-loss treatment for adults living with obesity and does it cause unwanted effects?,"To assess the effects of liraglutide, a GLP-1RA, for adults living with obesity, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and two trials registries on 17 December 2024. Liraglutide likely increases the proportion of people achieving at least 5% weight loss at medium-term follow-up; this effect is likely to be sustained at longer-term follow-up. Medium- or long-term impact on percentage weight change, MACE, quality of life, and mortality may be limited or uncertain. Liraglutide may lead to an increase in adverse events, including serious adverse events in both the medium and long term, which might further limit the sustainability of the initial effects. The drug manufacturer funded 22 studies, raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest. Further independent and long-term studies are needed to better understand the broader effects of liraglutide in the management of obesity.","Obesity is a long-term condition in which a person has too much body fat. It can increase the risk of health problems like type 2 diabetes, diseases of the heart and blood vessels (cardiovascular disease), and some types of cancer. Obesity levels are increasing worldwide, placing a significant burden on healthcare systems. Managing obesity usually involves lifestyle changes such as eating a healthier diet and being more physically active. However, many people find these changes difficult to maintain, and doctors may prescribe medications to support weight loss. Liraglutide is a type of medication that helps people feel full sooner, and so eat less. It was originally developed to treat type 2 diabetes but has been approved in many countries to help people lose weight. It is given as a daily injection. Some people taking liraglutide experience unwanted effects, such as feeling or being sick, diarrhoea and constipation. Liraglutide is a  GLP-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA). Similar medications include semaglutide and tirzepatide. We wanted to know how well liraglutide works in adults with obesity in the medium term (6 to 24 months) and long term (24 months or more). We examined its effects on weight, unwanted effects, obesity-related health problems, quality of life and risk of death. We did not look at what happens after people stop taking liraglutide. We searched for studies that investigated liraglutide for adults living with obesity. Studies could investigate any dose of liraglutide compared with placebo (sham medication), no treatment, lifestyle changes or another weight-loss medication. We included studies in which people took liraglutide for at least 6 months. We compared and analysed the results and assessed our confidence in the evidence. We found 24 studies with 9937 men and women with obesity, aged between 31 and 64 years. Some people had weight-related conditions like diabetes or liver disease. Most studies compared liraglutide with placebo. They mainly took place in high- and middle-income countries. People who took liraglutide were more likely to lose at least 5% of their body weight than those who took a placebo in the medium (18 studies, 6651 people) and long term (2 studies, 1262 people). However, we are uncertain about liraglutide's effects on people's overall percentage weight change from the beginning of the study to the medium term (16 studies, 6050 people) and there may be little to no difference in percentage weight change in the long term (2 studies, 1262 people). In the medium term, people taking liraglutide might experience more unwanted effects of any kind (16 studies, 8147 people) and more serious unwanted effects (20 studies, 8487 people) than those taking placebo. We are unsure about mild-to-moderate unwanted effects (17 studies, 7440 people) or whether unwanted effects caused people to stop treatment (19 studies, 8628 people). In the long term (2 studies, 2640 participants), liraglutide may increase unwanted effects and people may be more likely to stop treatment because of them. We are unsure about unwanted events overall and mild-to-moderate unwanted effects. Liraglutide probably makes little or no difference to quality of life both in the medium term (6 studies, 3733 people) and in the long term (1 study, 863 people). Liraglutide probably makes little or no difference to major cardiovascular events in the medium term (6 studies, 5762 people). We are unsure about its effects on major cardiovascular events in the long term and on deaths in the medium and long term. We are moderately confident that people taking liraglutide lose more weight than those taking placebo. However, our confidence in the other evidence is limited because of how the studies were conducted and information that was missing. Few studies looked at long-term effects or included different people from different places, so the results may not apply to everyone. The manufacturers of liraglutide were involved in the design, conduct or analysis of 22 of the 24 studies, which limits our confidence in the results.

606cf604adbb6982bb382881,static_2,Melatonin and agomelatine for prevention of winter depression,"Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a seasonal pattern of recurrent major depressive episodes that most commonly starts in autumn or winter and remits in spring. The prevalence of SAD depends on latitude and ranges from 1.5% to 9%. The predictable seasonal aspect of SAD provides a promising opportunity for prevention in people who have a history of SAD. This is one of four reviews on the efficacy and safety of interventions to prevent SAD; we focus on agomelatine and melatonin as preventive interventions. To assess the efficacy and safety of agomelatine and melatonin (in comparison with each other, placebo, second-generation antidepressants, light therapy, psychological therapy or lifestyle interventions) in preventing SAD and improving person-centred outcomes among adults with a history of SAD. We searched Ovid MEDLINE (1950- ), Embase (1974- ), PsycINFO (1967- ) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to 19 June 2018. An earlier search of these databases was conducted via the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trial Register (CCMD-CTR) (all years to 11 August 2015). Furthermore, we searched the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database and international trial registers (to 19 June 2018).

For adverse events, we intended also to include non-randomised studies. We planned to include studies that compared agomelatine versus melatonin, or agomelatine or melatonin versus placebo, any second-generation antidepressant, light therapy, psychological therapies or lifestyle changes. We also intended to compare melatonin or agomelatine in combination with any of the comparator interventions mentioned above versus the same comparator intervention as monotherapy.
Two review authors screened abstracts and full-text publications, abstracted data and assessed risk of bias of included studies independently. We intended to pool data in a meta-analysis using a random-effects model, but included only one study. We identified 3745 citations through electronic searches and reviews of reference lists after deduplication of search results. We excluded 3619 records during title and abstract review and assessed 126 full-text papers for inclusion in the review. Only one study, providing data of 225 participants, met our eligibility criteria and compared agomelatine (25 mg/day) with placebo. We rated it as having high risk of attrition bias because nearly half of the participants left the study before completion. We rated the certainty of the evidence as very low for all outcomes, because of high risk of bias, indirectness, and imprecision. The main analysis based on data of 199 participants rendered an indeterminate result with wide confidence intervals (CIs) that may encompass both a relevant reduction as well as a relevant increase of SAD incidence by agomelatine (risk ratio (RR) 0.83, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.34; 199 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Also the severity of SAD may be similar in both groups at the end of the study with a mean SIGH-SAD (Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Seasonal Affective Disorders) score of 8.3 (standard deviation (SD) 9.4) in the agomelatine group and 10.1 (SD 10.6) in the placebo group (mean difference (MD) -1.80, 95% CI -4.58 to 0.98; 199 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events may be similar in both groups. In the agomelatine group, 64 out of 112 participants experienced at least one adverse event, while 61 out of 113 did in the placebo group (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.34; 225 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Three out of 112 patients experienced serious adverse events in the agomelatine group, compared to 4 out of 113 in the placebo group (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.17 to 3.30; 225 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No data on quality of life or interpersonal functioning were reported. We did not identify any studies on melatonin.
Given the uncertain evidence on agomelatine and the absence of studies on melatonin, no conclusion about efficacy and safety of agomelatine and melatonin for prevention of SAD can currently be drawn. The decision for or against initiating preventive treatment of SAD and the treatment selected should consider patient preferences and reflect on the evidence base of all available treatment options.","Many people in northern latitudes suffer from seasonal affective disorder (SAD), which occurs as a reaction to reduced sunlight.

General practitioners, psychiatrists, pharmacists, other health professionals working in adult mental health services, and researchers could be interested in the results of this review. Anyone who has experienced winter depression, or who has friends or relatives who have experienced winter depression might also be interested. Because of the seasonal pattern and high recurrence of SAD, melatonin or agomelatine could be used to prevent the onset of depressed mood. The goal of this report is to examine whether benefits outweigh harms of melatonin or agomelatine when used to prevent onset of a new depressive episode in people with a history of SAD who were free of symptoms when the preventive intervention started. To date, this question has not been examined in a systematic way. This is one of four reviews on the efficacy and potential harms of interventions to prevent SAD.

All 225 participants had a history of winter depression but were not depressed when the prevention study started. The included study showed neither a clear effect in favour nor against agomelatine as a preventive treatment. In addition, the certainty of evidence for all outcomes was very low, making it impossible to draw any conclusions about the efficacy and safety of agomelatine for the prevention of winter depression. No evidence on melatonin for prevention of SAD was identified.

606cf604adbb6982bb382881,interactive_3,Use of medication to treat depression in people with opioid dependence,"Lifetime prevalence of depression in subjects with opioid dependence is higher than in the general population (44-54% versus 16%) and represents a risk factor for morbidity and mortality. For patients on opioid agonist treatment, current prevalence rates of depression ranges between 10 and 30%, influencing negatively the outcome of the treatment. To evaluate the efficacy and the acceptability of antidepressants for the treatment of depressed opioid dependents treated with opioid agonists. We searched Pubmed, EMBASE, CINAHL (to October 2009), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library Cochrane Drug and Alcohol Group Specialised Register, issue 4, 2009), main electronic sources of ongoing trials, specific trial databases and reference lists of all relevant papers. Randomised and controlled clinical trials examining the efficacy of any antidepressant medication to treat depressed opioid dependents in treatment with opioid agonists. Two authors independently screened and extracted data from studies. Seven studies, 482 participants, met the inclusion criteria.  Comparing antidepressant with placebo, no statistically significant results for dropouts. Selecting studies with low risk of bias, 325 participants, results favour placebo, RR 1.40 (Cl 95% 1.00 to 1.96). For severity of depression, results from two studies, 183 participants, favour antidepressants utilising Clinical Global Impression Scale RR 1.92 (CI 95% 1.26 to 2.94), while another study, 95 participants, utilising the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, did not find a statistically significant difference RR 0.96 (CI 95% 0.54 to 1.71). For adverse events, result favour placebo, four studies, 311 participants, RR 2.90 (Cl 95% 1.23 to 6.86). For drug use, three studies, 211 participants, it was not possible to pool data because outcomes' measures were not comparable. Looking at singular studies, no statistically significant difference was seen. - Comparing different classes of antidepressants, the results favour tricyclics for severity of depression, two studies, 183 participants, RR 1.92 (Cl 95% 1.26 to 2.94) and favour placebo for adverse events, two studies, 172 participants, RR 3.11 (Cl 95% 1.06 to 9.12). There is low evidence, at the present, supporting the clinical use of antidepressants for the treatment of depressed opioid addicts in treatment with opioid agonists. There is a need of larger randomised studies investigating relevant outcomes, safety issues and reporting data to allow comparison of results.","There is little evidence to support the use of antidepressants for treating people who are dependent on opioids and have clinical depression. Depression is more common in people with substance abuse and dependence than in the general population. The depression experienced is also associated with an increased risk of completed suicide. Depression may represent an independent disorder, the psychosocial stress associated with addictive behavior or it could be a consequence of drug use and drug withdrawal effects. A maintenance program with opioid agonists (methadone, buprenorphine, LAAM) is an effective treatment for people who are dependent on opioids in terms of retention in treatment and reduced use of opioids. Depression is however still prevalent and negatively impacts on treatment outcomes. Treatment with antidepressant drugs has therefore been proposed. These adjunct drug treatments include tricyclic antidepressants (doxepin, desipramine, imipramine) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs fluoxetine, sertraline). Authors included seven randomised controlled studies that involved 482 participants in our review. The studies were conducted in outpatient settings over four to 16 weeks; six were in USA and one in Australia. The mean age of participants was 34 years and 62% were males. No clear difference was found in the number of dropouts from an opioid agonist maintenance program between people receiving antidepressants and those in the placebo groups. Neither was drug use different (two studies). Severity of depression was reduced with the use of antidepressants (two studies), including tricyclic antidepressants. Adverse events were important as more of the participants who received antidepressants withdrew from the studies for medical reasons compared with those participants on placebo (four studies). The differences between studies in clinical (participant characteristics, the medications used, services and treatments delivered) and methodological characteristics (study design and quality) made it difficult to draw confident conclusions about the efficacy and safety of antidepressants for the treatment of depression in people who are dependent on opioids.",1118,depression; opioid dependence; opioid agonist treatment; antidepressants; tricyclics; adverse events,How does the presence of depression influence the outcomes of opioid agonist treatments according to the study?,What criteria should future studies meet to improve evidence on the efficacy of antidepressants for opioid-dependent individuals?,Select all of the following that are colors,What is the main conclusion about antidepressant use for opioid dependents?,"In the summary, how did adverse events affect antidepressant use in the studies?",It enhances the retention of participants in treatment programs.; It negatively impacts the treatment outcomes.; It has no significant impact on treatment outcomes.,It negatively impacts the treatment outcomes.,Larger randomized trials with relevant outcome reporting.; Increased focus on drug misuse prevention.; Studies with diverse participant characteristics.,Larger randomized trials with relevant outcome reporting.; Studies with diverse participant characteristics.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Little evidence supports their use; They are highly recommended; They completely cure both addiction and depression,Little evidence supports their use,They led to more study withdrawals; They had no impact on the studies; They improved retention in studies,They led to more study withdrawals
606cf604adbb6982bb382881,interactive_4,Are exercises for strengthening breathing muscles effective for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease?,"Inspiratory muscle training (IMT) aims to improve respiratory muscle strength and endurance. Clinical trials have used different training protocols, devices, and respiratory measurements to assess its effectiveness. Current guidelines suggest a possible benefit of IMT, particularly in people with respiratory muscle weakness, but it remains unclear how clinically useful IMT is, especially when combined with pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). We evaluated the effect of IMT on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), both as a stand-alone intervention and when combined with PR. We searched major medical databases and clinical trial registries up to 20 October 2022 and reviewed reference lists of relevant studies. We included randomized controlled trials comparing IMT plus PR versus PR alone, and IMT versus control or sham, using any type of IMT delivery. We excluded trials using resistive devices without breathing-pattern control or with training loads under 30% of maximal inspiratory pressure. Standard Cochrane methods and the RoB 2 tool were used. Primary outcomes included dyspnea, functional exercise capacity, and health-related quality of life. We included 55 RCTs. Interventions varied widely in duration, training load, devices, session frequency, and PR program structure. Only eight trials had low risk of bias. In the comparison of PR plus IMT versus PR alone, we found 22 trials with 1446 participants. IMT added to PR did not improve dyspnea on the Borg scale or the mMRC scale, and effects did not reach clinically meaningful differences. The 6-minute walk distance increased by 5.95 meters but did not reach the threshold for clinical improvement. Subgroup analyses showed no significant differences based on training duration or baseline inspiratory pressure. St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire and COPD Assessment Test scores also did not show clinically meaningful improvements. PImax increased by 11.46 cmH?O but did not meet the minimum clinically important difference, and subgroup analyses again showed no clear modifiers of effect. One abstract reported minor, self-limited adverse effects. In the comparison of IMT versus control or sham, 37 trials with 1021 participants were included. IMT showed a trend toward improved Borg dyspnea scores, but evidence quality was very low. Eight studies using the BDI-TDI showed improvement only in the TDI total score. mMRC scores suggested possible improvement. IMT improved 6-minute walk distance by 35.71 meters, reaching moderate-certainty evidence. SGRQ total scores showed a modest effect in favor of IMT, but evidence was very low. CAT scores improved with IMT. PImax increased by 14.57 cmH?O but did not reach the clinically important threshold. Subgroup analyses again did not identify clear effect modifiers. No included trials reported adverse events. IMT may not improve dyspnea, functional exercise capacity, or quality of life when combined with PR, but IMT alone is likely to improve these outcomes. Whether greater effects occur in people with respiratory muscle weakness or with longer training durations remains uncertain.","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung condition in which the airways become blocked, causing shortness of breath and coughing. It typically develops after long-term exposure to irritating gases such as cigarette smoke and industrial chemicals. Strengthening the breathing muscles is thought to improve airflow and ease symptoms. Health professionals use different exercise approaches to help manage COPD. Some people follow general exercise and education programs to reduce symptoms and improve fitness and quality of life. Others perform breathing exercises using devices that strengthen the diaphragm and rib muscles by adding resistance; this is called inspiratory muscle training (IMT). These devices are also used by people with healthy lungs to improve athletic performance. We wanted to find out whether exercise combined with IMT works better than exercise alone, and whether IMT works better than no training or sham IMT, in improving breathlessness, physical fitness, and quality of life. (A sham device looks real but has no training effect, allowing a fair comparison.) We also wanted to check whether IMT causes any unwanted effects. We searched for studies comparing exercise plus IMT versus exercise alone, and IMT versus no training or sham IMT, then summarized the findings and evaluated the quality of the evidence. We found 22 studies with 1446 participants lasting from 2 to 24 weeks that compared exercise plus IMT to exercise alone. Exercise programs varied widely some used treadmill-only or cycling-only sessions, while others combined treadmill and cycling with muscle strengthening, stair climbing, and education. IMT devices and training durations also varied. Overall, adding IMT to exercise probably makes little to no difference in breathlessness, has unknown effects on physical fitness, may make little to no difference in quality of life, and probably makes little to no difference in breathing muscle strength. We also found 37 studies with 1021 participants lasting from 2 weeks to a year that compared IMT alone with no training or sham IMT.

IMT alone may reduce breathlessness on one measurement scale but shows unclear effects on two others; it probably improves physical fitness; it probably improves quality of life on one scale but shows unclear benefits on another; and it may make little to no difference to breathing muscle strength.

606cf604adbb6982bb382881,interactive_4,Drug or psychological interventions for preventing depression in people with long-term physical conditions,"Major depression is one of the world's leading causes of disability in adults with long-term physical conditions compared to those without physical illness. This co-morbidity is associated with a negative prognosis in terms of increased morbidity and mortality rates, increased healthcare costs, decreased adherence to treatment regimens, and a substantial decline in quality of life. Therefore, preventing the onset of depressive episodes in adults with long-term physical conditions should be a global healthcare aim. In this review, primary or tertiary (in cases of preventing recurrences in those with a history of depression) prevention are the focus. While primary prevention aims at preventing the onset of depression, tertiary prevention comprises both preventing recurrences and prohibiting relapses. Tertiary prevention aims to address a depressive episode that might still be present, is about to subside, or has recently resolved. We included tertiary prevention in the case where the focus was preventing the onset of depression in those with a history of depression (preventing recurrences) but excluded it if it specifically focused on maintaining an condition or implementing rehabilitation services (relapse prevention). Secondary prevention of depression seeks to prevent the progression of depressive symptoms by early detection and treatment and may therefore be considered a 'treatment,' rather than prevention. We therefore exclude the whole spectrum of secondary prevention. To assess the effectiveness, acceptability and tolerability of psychological or pharmacological interventions, in comparison to control conditions, in preventing depression in adults with long-term physical conditions; either before first ever onset of depressive symptoms (i.e. primary prevention) or before first onset of depressive symptoms in patients with a history of depression (i.e. tertiary prevention). We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and two trials registries, up to 6 February 2020. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of preventive psychological or pharmacological interventions, specifically targeting incidence of depression in comparison to treatment as usual (TAU), waiting list, attention/psychological placebo, or placebo. Participants had to be age 18 years or older, with at least one long-term physical condition, and no diagnosis of major depression at baseline (primary prevention). In addition, we included studies comprising mixed samples of patients with and without a history of depression, which explored tertiary prevention of recurrent depression. We excluded other tertiary prevention studies. We also excluded secondary preventive interventions. Primary outcomes included incidence of depression, tolerability, and acceptability. Secondary outcomes included severity of depression, cost-effectiveness and cost-utility. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We included 11 RCTs, with one trial on psychological interventions, and 10 trials on pharmacological interventions. Data analyses on the psychological intervention (problem-solving therapy compared to TAU) included 194 participants with age-related macular degeneration. Data analyses on pharmacological interventions included 837 participants comparing citalopram (one trial), escitalopram (three trials), a mixed sample of fluoxetine/nortriptyline (one trial), melatonin (one trial), milnacipran (one trial), and sertraline (three trials), each to placebo. Included types of long-term physical conditions were acute coronary syndrome (one trial), breast cancer (one trial), head and neck cancer (two trials), stroke (five trials), and traumatic brain injury (one trial). Very low-certainty evidence of one study suggests that problem solving therapy may be slightly more effective than TAU in preventing the incidence of depression, immediately post-intervention (odds ratio (OR) 0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.20 to 0.95; 194 participants). However, there may be little to no difference between groups at six months follow-up (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.38; 190 participants; one study; very low-certainty evidence). No data were available regarding incidence of depression after six months. Regarding acceptability (drop-outs due to any cause), slightly fewer drop-outs occurred in the TAU group immediately post-intervention (OR 5.21, 95% CI 1.11 to 24.40; 206 participants; low-certainty evidence). After six months, however, the groups did not differ (OR 1.67, 95% CI 0.58 to 4.77; 206 participants; low-certainty evidence). This study did not measure tolerability. Post-intervention, compared to placebo, antidepressants may be beneficial in preventing depression in adults with different types of long-term physical conditions, but the evidence is very uncertain (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.49; 814 participants; nine studies; I2 = 0%; very low-certainty evidence). There may be little to no difference between groups both immediately and at six months follow-up (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.08 to 2.46; 23 participants; one study; very low-certainty evidence) as well as at six to 12 months follow-up (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.23 to 2.82; 233 participants; three studies; I2 = 49%; very low-certainty evidence). There was very low-certainty evidence from five studies regarding the tolerability of the pharmacological intervention. A total of 669 adverse events were observed in 316 participants from the pharmacological intervention group, and 610 adverse events from 311 participants in the placebo group. There was very low-certainty evidence that drop-outs due to adverse events may be less frequent in the placebo group (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.07 to 3.89; 561 participants; five studies; I2 = 0%). There was also very low-certainty evidence that drop-outs due to any cause may not differ between groups either post-intervention (OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.73; 962 participants; nine studies; I2 = 28%), or at six to 12 months (OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.86; 327 participants; three studies; I2 = 0%). Based on evidence of very low certainty, our results may indicate the benefit of pharmacological interventions, during or directly after preventive treatment. Few trials examined short-term outcomes up to six months, nor the follow-up effects at six to 12 months, with studies suffering from great numbers of drop-outs and inconclusive results. Generalisation of results is limited as study populations and treatment regimes were very heterogeneous. Based on the results of this review, we conclude that for adults with long-term physical conditions, there is only very uncertain evidence regarding the implementation of any primary preventive interventions (psychological/pharmacological) for depression.","People with long-term illness or other physical health conditions have a higher risk than other people of developing depression. This can reduce their quality of life. Depression is characterised by symptoms such as low mood, feelings of hopelessness, loss of interest in things that once gave pleasure, and other symptoms, as well as sleep disturbances. People with long-term physical conditions who develop depression are more likely to worsen in their illnesses and are more likely to die. Therefore, preventing depression in people with long-term physical conditions should be an important goal in healthcare. We wanted to know whether standard interventions for treating depression (i.e. psychological treatments and antidepressant drugs) can also safely be used to prevent the onset of an depressive episode in those adults at high risk for depression due to their long-term physical condition, but who do not yet show depressive symptoms. We also wanted to know whether these interventions worked in preventing recurrent depression, in those patients with long-term physical conditions who had a history of depression. First, we searched the medical literature for randomised controlled studies (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups). This type of study provides the most robust evidence about the effects of a treatment. We then compared the results, and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we assessed how certain the evidence was. To do this, we considered factors such as the way studies were conducted, study sizes, and consistency of findings across studies. Based on our assessments, we categorised the evidence as being of very low, low, moderate or high certainty. Medical and mental health care providers (including physicians and psychologists) and pharmacists, as well as adults with long-term physical conditions, their relatives and care-givers. This review includes 11 trials comparing a psychological intervention (problem-solving therapy) to treatment as usual; or comparing pharmacological antidepressant interventions (citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline, fluoxetine/nortriptyline, milnacipran, or melatonin) to placebo. For the psychological intervention, we found only one trial, including 194 people with age-related macular degeneration (an eye disease). For pharmacological interventions, we included 10 trials comprising 1009 people. Due to some participants not completing the studies, we could only analyse data for 837 participants. Our analyses show that people with long-term physical conditions may be less likely to develop depression during treatment with problem solving therapy, or with different types of antidepressants. However, these interventions appear to be beneficial only during treatment. Three to 12 months after treatment, there was no significant difference in onset of depression between the groups that had the interventions and those that did not. Therefore, preventive interventions might be effective in preventing depression onset only for the duration of the intervention. Our conclusions are based on evidence of very low certainty. In addition, there is not enough adequate information on the tolerability (unpleasant but generally medically less important adverse events due to the intervention, e.g. dry mouth) and acceptability (willingness to go through with the intervention even in the presence of adverse events) of these treatments. The interventions may be unsafe, irrespective of their potential to prevent depression.",1119,major depression; disability; co-morbidity; primary prevention; tertiary prevention; depressive episodes; psychological interventions; pharmacological interventions; antidepressants; very low-certainty evidence,"Based on the summary, how valid is it to generalize the study findings to all adults with long-term physical conditions?",What are the main reasons for attempting to prevent depression in people with long-term physical conditions?,Select the items that are animals,How might the onset of depression affect people with long-term physical conditions?,Which interventions were assessed for preventing depression in the study?,"Highly valid, as the study included a large diverse cohort.; Limited validity due to varied physical conditions represented.; Invalid, as the study focused solely on specific conditions like cancer and stroke.",Limited validity due to varied physical conditions represented.,To reduce the risk of developing depression; To increase healthcare costs; To prevent worsening of physical illnesses,To reduce the risk of developing depression; To prevent worsening of physical illnesses,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,It may improve their quality of life; It may increase the risk of mortality; It may decrease adherence to their treatment,It may increase the risk of mortality; It may decrease adherence to their treatment,Psychological interventions; Dietary supplements; Pharmacological interventions,Psychological interventions; Pharmacological interventions
606cf604adbb6982bb382881,finetuned_5,Aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for the prevention of dementia,"Dementia is a worldwide concern. Its global prevalence is increasing. At present, there is no medication licensed to prevent or delay the onset of dementia. Inflammation has been suggested as a key factor in dementia pathogenesis. Therefore, medications with anti-inflammatory properties could be beneficial for dementia prevention. To evaluate the effectiveness and adverse effects of aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for the primary or secondary prevention of dementia. We searched ALOIS, the specialised register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group up to 9 January 2020. ALOIS contains records of clinical trials identified from monthly searches of several major healthcare databases, trial registries and grey literature sources. We ran additional searches across MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP) and six other databases to ensure that the searches were as comprehensive and up-to-date as possible. We also reviewed citations of reference lists of included studies. We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) comparing aspirin or other NSAIDs with placebo for the primary or secondary prevention of dementia. We included trials with cognitively healthy participants (primary prevention) or participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or cognitive complaints (secondary prevention). We used standard methodological procedures according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We rated the strength of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach. We included four RCTs with 23,187 participants. Because of the diversity of these trials, we did not combine data to give summary estimates, but presented a narrative description of the evidence. We identified one trial (19,114 participants) comparing low-dose aspirin (100 mg once daily) to placebo. Participants were aged 70 years or older with no history of dementia, cardiovascular disease or physical disability. Interim analysis indicated no significant treatment effect and the trial was terminated slightly early after a median of 4.7 years' follow-up. There was no evidence of a difference in incidence of dementia between aspirin and placebo groups (risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.15; high-certainty evidence). Participants allocated aspirin had higher rates of major bleeding (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.60, high-certainty evidence) and slightly higher mortality (RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.28; high-certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in activities of daily living between groups (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.02; high-certainty evidence). We identified three trials comparing non-aspirin NSAIDs to placebo. All three trials were terminated early due to adverse events associated with NSAIDs reported in other trials. One trial (2528 participants) investigated the cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor celecoxib (200 mg twice daily) and the non-selective NSAID naproxen (220 mg twice daily) for preventing dementia in cognitively healthy older adults with a family history of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Median follow-up was 734 days. Combining both NSAID treatment arms, there was no evidence of a difference in the incidence of AD between participants allocated NSAIDs and those allocated placebo (RR 1.91, 95% CI 0.89 to 4.10; moderate-certainty evidence). There was also no evidence of a difference in rates of myocardial infarction (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.61 to 2.40), stroke (RR 1.82, 95% CI 0.76 to 4.37) or mortality (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.43) between treatment groups (all moderate-certainty evidence). One trial (88 participants) assessed the effectiveness of celecoxib (200 mg or 400 mg daily) in delaying cognitive decline in participants aged 40 to 81 years with mild age-related memory loss but normal memory performance scores. Mean duration of follow-up was 17.6 months in the celecoxib group and 18.1 months in the placebo group. There was no evidence of a difference between groups in test scores in any of six cognitive domains. Participants allocated celecoxib experienced more gastrointestinal adverse events than those allocated placebo (RR 2.66, 95% CI 1.05 to 6.75; low-certainty evidence). One trial (1457 participants) assessed the effectiveness of the COX-2 inhibitor rofecoxib (25 mg once daily) in delaying or preventing a diagnosis of AD in participants with MCI. Median duration of study participation was 115 weeks in the rofecoxib group and 130 weeks in the placebo group. There was a higher incidence of AD in the rofecoxib than the placebo group (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.72; moderate-certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between groups in cardiovascular adverse events (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.66; moderate-certainty evidence) or mortality (RR 1.62, 95% CI 0.85 to 3.05; moderate-certainty evidence). Participants allocated rofecoxib had more upper gastrointestinal adverse events (RR 3.53, 95% CI 1.17 to 10.68; moderate-certainty evidence). Reported annual mean difference scores showed no evidence of a difference between groups in activities of daily living (year 1: no data available; year 2: 0.0, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.2; year 3: 0.1, 95% CI - 0.1 to 0.3; year 4: 0.1, 95% CI -0.1 to 0.4; moderate-certainty evidence). There is no evidence to support the use of low-dose aspirin or other NSAIDs of any class (celecoxib, rofecoxib or naproxen) for the prevention of dementia, but there was evidence of harm. Although there were limitations in the available evidence, it seems unlikely that there is any need for further trials of low-dose aspirin for dementia prevention. If future studies of NSAIDs for dementia prevention are planned, they will need to be cognisant of the safety concerns arising from the existing studies.","Dementia is a worldwide healthcare concern. At present, there is no medicine that is proven to delay or prevent the onset of dementia. The biology of dementia is still poorly understood. However, there are reasons to believe that inflammation may be partly responsible for some of the brain changes seen in dementia. There are many medicines that have anti-inflammatory properties, including aspirin and NSAIDs that are often sold as pain killers. We wanted to see if these medicines had any effect on developing dementia. These medicines have a few potential side effects, including heart attack and bleeding, so we also assessed for any harmful effects of the medicines. We searched for relevant studies that had been published up to January 2020. We found four trials that met the inclusion criteria for this review (23,187 people). One trial was undertaken in the USA and Australia and three in the USA only. The trials included different populations. One was of aspirin in healthy people with no history of dementia, cardiovascular disease or physical disability. The other three were of NSAIDs other than aspirin and were conducted in healthy people with a family history of Alzheimer's disease, people with self-reported memory loss and people with mild cognitive impairment (a slight but noticeable and measurable decline in cognitive abilities, including memory and thinking skills). All of the included studies had limitations. The study of aspirin was stopped early due to ineffectiveness. The three studies of other NSAIDs (celecoxib, naproxen and rofecoxib) were stopped early due to concerns around the safety. This review found no evidence to support the use of either aspirin or other NSAIDs for the prevention of dementia and, in fact, there was some suggestion that they may cause harm. The studies had limitations, but, given the concerns over safety, further studies of low-dose aspirin for dementia prevention seem unlikely. If future studies of NSAIDs for dementia prevention are planned, then these will need to be mindful of the safety concerns arising from the studies included in this review and from other studies of the same medicines.",1132,Dementia; inflammation; anti-inflammatory properties; non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); primary prevention; secondary prevention; cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor; celecoxib; naproxen; rofecoxib,What could be the implications of the study's findings on future research into dementia prevention utilizing NSAIDs?,In what ways do the limitations of these studies influence the perceived strength of the evidence regarding NSAIDs' effectiveness in dementia prevention?,Select all of the following that are colors,Identify the primary goal of the study regarding these medications.,Summarize the main finding of the aspirin study in relation to dementia prevention.,Future studies will likely focus on alternative anti-inflammatory agents.; The safety concerns highlighted will necessitate the development of safer NSAID formulations.; There will be an increased interest in combining NSAIDs with other treatments to enhance effectiveness.,Future studies will likely focus on alternative anti-inflammatory agents.; The safety concerns highlighted will necessitate the development of safer NSAID formulations.,The limitations significantly weaken the evidence's reliability.; The limitations bolster confidence in the studies' findings.; The limitations necessitate a nuanced interpretation of the results.,The limitations significantly weaken the evidence's reliability.; The limitations necessitate a nuanced interpretation of the results.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,To observe their effectiveness in delaying or preventing dementia; To cure existing cases of dementia; To discover new side effects,To observe their effectiveness in delaying or preventing dementia,No evidence was found to support the use of aspirin for dementia prevention.; Aspirin was found to effectively prevent dementia.; Aspirin increased the risk of developing dementia.,No evidence was found to support the use of aspirin for dementia prevention.
606cf604adbb6982bb382881,finetuned_6,Collaborative care for people with depression and anxiety,"Common mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety, are estimated to affect up to 15% of the UK population at any one time, and health care systems worldwide need to implement interventions to reduce the impact and burden of these conditions; collaborative care is a complex intervention based on chronic disease management models that may be effective in the management of these common mental health problems. To assess the effectiveness of collaborative care for patients with depression or anxiety, we searched databases to February 2012, including The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group (CCDAN) trials registers (CCDANCTR-References and CCDANCTR-Studies) which include relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from MEDLINE (1950 to present), EMBASE (1974 to present), PsycINFO (1967 to present) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, all years), as well as the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal (ICTRP), ClinicalTrials.gov, and CINAHL (to November 2010 only), and we screened the reference lists of reports of all included studies and published systematic reviews for reports of additional studies. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of collaborative care for participants of all ages with depression or anxiety were included; two independent researchers extracted data using a standardised data extraction sheet, made 'Risk of bias' assessments using criteria from The Cochrane Collaboration, combined continuous measures of outcome using standardised mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), combined dichotomous measures using risk ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs, and conducted sensitivity analyses to test robustness. We included seventy-nine RCTs (including 90 relevant comparisons) involving 24,308 participants in the review, and studies varied in terms of risk of bias. The results of primary analyses demonstrated significantly greater improvement in depression outcomes for adults with depression treated with the collaborative care model in the short-term (SMD -0.34, 95% CI -0.41 to -0.27; RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.43), medium-term (SMD -0.28, 95% CI -0.41 to -0.15; RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.48), and long-term (SMD -0.35, 95% CI -0.46 to -0.24; RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.41); however, these significant benefits were not demonstrated into the very long-term (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.27). The results also demonstrated significantly greater improvement in anxiety outcomes for adults with anxiety treated with the collaborative care model in the short-term (SMD -0.30, 95% CI -0.44 to -0.17; RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.87), medium-term (SMD -0.33, 95% CI -0.47 to -0.19; RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.69), and long-term (SMD -0.20, 95% CI -0.34 to -0.06; RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.42); no comparisons examined the effects of the intervention on anxiety outcomes in the very long-term. There was evidence of benefit in secondary outcomes including medication use, mental health quality of life, and patient satisfaction, although there was less evidence of benefit in physical quality of life. Collaborative care is associated with significant improvement in depression and anxiety outcomes compared with usual care, and represents a useful addition to clinical pathways for adult patients with depression and anxiety.","Many people suffer from depression and anxiety, and these problems can make people feel sad, scared and even suicidal, and can affect their work, their relationships and their quality of life; depression and anxiety can occur because of personal, financial, social or health problems. Collaborative care is an innovative way of treating depression and anxiety and involves a number of health professionals working with a patient to help them overcome their problems; it often involves a medical doctor, a case manager (with training in depression and anxiety), and a mental health specialist such as a psychiatrist, with the case manager having regular contact with the person and organising care together with the medical doctor and specialist, and offering help with medication or access to a talking therapy to help the patient get better. Collaborative care has been tested with patients in a number of countries and health care systems, but it is not clear whether it should be recommended for people with depression or anxiety. In this review we found 79 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (90 comparisons) including 24,308 patients worldwide, comparing collaborative care with routine care or alternative treatments (such as consultation-liaison) for depression and anxiety; there were problems with the methods in some of the studies, for example, the methods used to allocate patients to collaborative care or routine care were not always free from bias, and many patients did not complete follow-up or provide information about their outcomes. Most of the studies focused on depression and the evidence suggests that collaborative care is better than routine care in improving depression for up to two years; a smaller number of studies examined the effect of collaborative care on anxiety and the evidence suggests that collaborative care is also better than usual care in improving anxiety for up to two years. Collaborative care increases the number of patients using medication in line with current guidance, and can improve mental health related quality of life, and patients with depression and anxiety treated with collaborative care are also more satisfied with their treatment.",1114,collaborative care; chronic disease management models; mental health problems; depression outcomes; anxiety outcomes; medication use; mental health quality of life; patient satisfaction; physical quality of life; clinical pathways,Why is there uncertainty about recommending collaborative care for depression and anxiety?,In what ways can collaborative care enhance the treatment of depression and anxiety?,Select the items that are animals,What are the common issues targeted by collaborative care?,How does collaborative care compare with routine care in managing depression?,The impact on very long-term outcomes is unclear.; The intervention is clearly less effective than routine care.; The number of health professionals involved makes it impractical.,The impact on very long-term outcomes is unclear.,By increasing the use of medication in line with guidelines.; By improving long-term physical quality of life.; By reducing the need for professional involvement.,By increasing the use of medication in line with guidelines.,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,Depression and anxiety; Cardiovascular diseases; Infectious diseases,Depression and anxiety,Collaborative care is better at improving depression outcomes; Routine care is more effective; Both have similar effects,Collaborative care is better at improving depression outcomes
606cf604adbb6982bb382881,finetuned_6,What are the benefits and risks of cognitive rehabilitation for people with mild-to-moderate dementia?,"Cognitive impairments affect functional ability in people with dementia. Cognitive rehabilitation (CR) is a personalised, solution-focused approach that aims to enable people with mild-to-moderate dementia to manage everyday activities and maintain as much independence as possible. To evaluate the effects of CR on everyday functioning and other outcomes for people with mild-to-moderate dementia, and on outcomes for care partners. To identify and explore factors that may be associated with the efficacy of CR. We searched the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialised Register, which contains records from MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, LILACS, and other clinical trial databases, and grey literature sources. The most recent search was completed on 19 October 2022. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing CR with control conditions and reporting relevant outcomes for the person with dementia and/or the care partner. We extracted relevant data from published manuscripts and contacted trial authors if necessary. Within each of the comparisons, we pooled data for each outcome of interest and conducted inverse-variance, random-effects meta-analyses. We evaluated the certainty of the evidence using GRADEpro GDT. We identified six eligible RCTs published in English between 2010 and 2022, which together included 1702 participants. The mean age of participants ranged from 76 to 80 and the proportion of male participants was between 29.4% and 79.3%. Most participants, in the studies where the type of dementia was reported, had a diagnosis of Alzheimers disease (AD; n = 1002, 58.9% of the whole sample, 81.2% of the participants for whom the specific diagnosis was reported). Risk of bias in the individual studies was relatively low. The exception was a high risk of bias in relation to blinding of participants and practitioners, which is not usually feasible with psychosocial interventions. Our primary outcome of everyday functioning was operationalised in the included studies as goal attainment in relation to activities targeted in the intervention. For our main comparison of CR with usual care, we pooled data for goal attainment evaluated from three perspectives (self-rating of performance, informant rating of performance, and self-rating of satisfaction with performance) at end of treatment and at medium-term follow-up (3 to 12 months). We could also pool data at these time points for 20 and 19 secondary outcomes respectively. The review findings were strongly driven by one large, high-quality RCT. We found high-certainty evidence of large positive effects of CR on all three primary outcome perspectives at the end of treatment: participant self-ratings of goal attainment (standardised mean difference (SMD) 1.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.26 to 1.66; I2 = 0%; 3 RCTs, 501 participants), informant ratings of goal attainment (SMD 1.61, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.21; I2 = 41%; 3 RCTs, 476 participants), and self-ratings of satisfaction with goal attainment (SMD 1.31, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.54; I2 = 5%; 3 RCTs, 501 participants), relative to an inactive control condition. At medium-term follow-up, we found high-certainty evidence showing a large positive effect of CR on all three primary outcome perspectives: participant self-ratings of goal attainment (SMD 1.46, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.68; I2 = 0%; 2 RCTs, 432 participants), informant ratings of goal attainment (SMD 1.25, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.72; I2 = 29%; 3 RCTs, 446 participants), and self-ratings of satisfaction with goal attainment (SMD 1.19, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.66; I2 = 28%; 2 RCTs, 432 participants), relative to an inactive control condition. For participants at the end of treatment we found high-certainty evidence showing a small positive effect of CR on self-efficacy (2 RCTs, 456 participants) and immediate recall (2 RCTs, 459 participants). For participants at medium-term follow-up we found moderate-certainty evidence showing a small positive effect of CR on auditory selective attention (2 RCTs, 386 participants), and a small negative effect on general functional ability (3 RCTs, 673 participants), and we found low-certainty evidence showing a small positive effect on sustained attention (2 RCTs, 413 participants), and a small negative effect on memory (2 RCTs, 51 participants) and anxiety (3 RCTs, 455 participants). We found moderate- and low-certainty evidence indicating that at the end of treatment CR had negligible effects on participant anxiety, quality of life, sustained attention, memory, delayed recall, and general functional ability, and at medium-term follow-up on participant self-efficacy, depression, quality of life, immediate recall, and verbal fluency. For care partners at the end of treatment we found low-certainty evidence showing a small positive effect on environmental aspects of quality of life (3 RCTs, 465 care partners), and small negative effects of CR on level of depression (2 RCTs, 32 care partners) and on psychological wellbeing (2 RCTs, 388 care partners). For care partners at medium-term follow-up we found high-certainty evidence showing a small positive effect of CR on social aspects of quality of life (3 RCTs, 436 care partners) and moderate-certainty evidence showing a small positive effect on psychological aspects of quality of life (3 RCTs, 437 care partners). We found moderate- and low-certainty evidence at the end of treatment that CR had negligible effects on care partners physical health, psychological and social aspects of quality of life, and stress, and at medium-term follow-up for the physical health aspect of care partners quality of life and psychological wellbeing. CR is helpful in enabling people with mild or moderate dementia to improve their ability to manage the everyday activities targeted in the intervention. Confidence in these findings could be strengthened if more high-quality studies contributed to the observed effects. The available evidence suggests that CR can form a valuable part of a clinical toolkit to assist people with dementia in overcoming some of the everyday barriers imposed by cognitive and functional difficulties. Future research, including process evaluation studies, could help identify avenues to maximise CR effects and achieve wider impacts on functional ability and wellbeing.","Dementia is a group of symptoms caused by changes in the brain that get worse over time. People with some types of dementia have difficulties with memory, planning, concentrating, and communicating. These and other thinking difficulties are collectively described by the umbrella term, 'cognitive impairment'. Cognitive impairment makes it harder to do daily activities and stay independent for as long as possible.
Cognitive rehabilitation is a personalised intervention. People have one-to-one sessions with a practitioner, usually in their own home. People identify everyday activities and tasks that they would like to manage better or do more independently. The practitioner suggests strategies and works with them to help achieve these improvements in the activities that are important to them. Family members are often involved as well.
We explored whether cognitive rehabilitation was better than usual treatment for: doing a chosen task or activity that matters to the person; managing daily activities; feeling confident about being able to manage things; feeling depressed or anxious; having a sense of wellbeing. We also explored whether cognitive rehabilitation was better for ensuring the wellbeing of the care partner - usually a husband, wife, or other close family member.
We searched for studies that rigorously tested the effects of cognitive rehabilitation for people with mild-to-moderate dementia. In these studies, some people had their usual treatment and others had their usual treatment plus cognitive rehabilitation. This made it possible to see whether cognitive rehabilitation was more helpful than usual treatment alone. We compared and summarised the results of the studies. We rated our confidence in the evidence the studies provided, based on the methods used and the numbers of people involved. We found six studies. They involved 1702 people with mild-to-moderate dementia, who had between 8 and 14 sessions with a cognitive rehabilitation practitioner. Alzheimers disease was the most common dementia diagnosis (59% of all participants, 82% of participants with the specific diagnosis reported).
The main findings are that, compared to people who just had their usual treatment, people who had cognitive rehabilitation got better at doing their chosen tasks or activities.
This improvement was seen by the people with dementia and by their care partners. The improvement was seen straight after cognitive rehabilitation and was still noticeable 3 to 12 months later.
Straight after cognitive rehabilitation, compared to people who just had their usual treatment, people with dementia may feel more confident about how they are managing.
There might not be any differences in the wellbeing of people with dementia and their care partners. We are not sure if there are any differences for people with dementia in managing other tasks or activities or in feeling depressed. Three to 12 months after cognitive rehabilitation, compared to usual treatment, care partners may have better psychological wellbeing.
There may not be any differences in how well people with dementia manage other tasks or activities, in how confident or depressed they feel, or in their wellbeing.
Our review included six studies, but the findings are based mostly on information from one large study. We do not know if the effects of cognitive rehabilitation last more than a year.

616cf9ae07c1c6bd05d95beb,static_1,Integrated compared with non-integrated orbital implants for treating anophthalmic sockets,"Anophthalmia is the absence of one or both eyes, and it can be congenital (i.e. a birth defect) or acquired later in life. There are two main types of orbital implant: integrated, whereby the implant receives a blood supply from the body that allows for the integration of the prosthesis within the tissue; and non-integrated, where the implant remains separate. Despite the remarkable progress in anophthalmic socket reconstruction and in the development of various types of implants, there are still uncertainties about the real roles of integrated (hydroxyapatite (HA), porous polyethylene (PP), composites) and non-integrated (polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA)/acrylic and silicone) orbital implants in anophthalmic socket treatment.
To assess the effects of integrated versus non-integrated orbital implants for treating anophthalmic sockets.
We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2016, Issue 7), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to August 2016), Embase (January 1980 to August 2016), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (1982 to August 2016), the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov), and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 8 August 2016.
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of integrated and non-integrated orbital implants for treating anophthalmic sockets.
Two authors independently selected relevant trials, assessed methodological quality and extracted data.
We included three studies with a total of 284 participants (250 included in analysis). The studies were conducted in India, Iran and the Netherlands. The three studies were clinically heterogenous, comparing different materials and using different surgical techniques. None of the included studies used a peg (i.e. a fixing pin used to connect the implant to the prosthesis). In general the trials were poorly reported, and we judged them to be at unclear risk of bias. One trial compared HA using traditional enucleation versus alloplastic implantation using evisceration (N = 100). This trial was probably not masked. The second trial compared PP with scleral cap enucleation versus PMMA with either myoconjunctival or traditional enucleation (N = 150). Although participants were not masked, outcome assessors were. The last trial compared HA and acrylic using the enucleation technique (N = 34) but did not report comparative effectiveness data. In the trial comparing HA versus alloplastic implantation, there was no evidence of any difference between the two groups with respect to the proportion of successful procedures at one year (risk ratio (RR) 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95 to 1.09, N = 100, low-certainty evidence). People receiving HA had slightly worse horizontal implant mobility compared to the alloplastic group (mean difference (MD) -3.35 mm, 95% CI - 4.08 to - 2.62, very low-certainty evidence) and slightly worse vertical implant motility (MD -2.76 mm, 95% CI -3.45 to -2.07, very low-certainty evidence). As different techniques were used - enucleation versus evisceration - it is not clear whether these differences in implant motility can be attributed solely to the type of material. Investigators did not report adverse events. In the trial comparing PP versus PMMA, there was no evidence of any difference between the two groups with respect to the proportion of successful procedures at one year (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.01, N = 150, low-certainty evidence). There was very low-certainty evidence of a difference in horizontal implant motility depending on whether PP was compared to PMMA with traditional enucleation (MD 1.96 mm, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.91) or PMMA with myoconjunctival enucleation (-0.57 mm, 95% CI -1.63 to 0.49). Similarly, for vertical implant motility, there was very low-certainty evidence of a difference in the comparison of PP to PMMA traditional (MD 3.12 mm 95% CI 2.36 to 3.88) but no evidence of a difference when comparing PP to PMMA myoconjunctival (MD -0.20 mm 95% CI  -1.28 to 0.88). Four people in the PP group (total N = 50) experienced adverse events (i.e. exposures) compared to 6/100 in the PMMA groups (RR 17.82, 95% CI 0.98 to 324.67, N = 150, very low-certainty evidence). None of the studies reported socket sphere size, cosmetic effect or quality of life measures.
Current very low-certainty evidence from three small published randomised controlled trials did not provide sufficient evidence to assess the effect of integrated and non-integrated material orbital implants for treating anophthalmic sockets. This review underlines the need to conduct further well-designed trials in this field.","The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out if integrated orbital implants are better than non-integrated orbital implants for treating anophthalmic sockets. Cochrane researchers collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found three studies.
There is uncertainty as to the benefits and harms of integrated compared with non-integrated orbital implants. What was studied in the review? 'Anophthalmia' is the absence of the eye in the orbit. This can occur in childhood (because of problems with development) or it can happen during the course of life (due to an accident or other eye disease).
Doctors can put an implant in the orbit to fill the void left by the removal of the eye and this together with an external prosthesis can improve the patient's appearance. This orbital implant can be made of two types of materials - integrated or non-integrated material. If the material is integrated, then new blood vessels can grow into the implant material. If the material is non-integrated, then the orbital implant remains separate from the rest of the orbit's tissue.
The review authors looked to see if the type of implant material affected the success of the surgery or, in other words, if integrated implants can provide better results than non-integrated implants. They were also interested in how much the external prosthesis could move better after surgery - using integrated or non-integrated orbital implants. Also, the authors wanted to know if the type of orbital implant material can affect people's quality of life. Were there any adverse (harmful) effects of using integrated or non-integrated orbital implants?
The type of material used for the orbital implant may not affect the success of the surgery (low-certainty evidence). The review authors judged the evidence on prosthesis movement and adverse effects as providing very little certainty about the true effects. There was no information on quality of life.

616cf9ae07c1c6bd05d95beb,static_2,"Pharmacological, non-invasive brain stimulation and psychological interventions for treating depression after stroke","Depression is an important morbidity associated with stroke that impacts on recovery, yet is often undetected or inadequately treated. This review aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of pharmacological intervention, non-invasive brain stimulation, psychological therapy, or combinations of these to treat depression after stroke. This is a living systematic review, and we search for new evidence every two months and update the review when we identify relevant new evidence; we searched the Specialised Registers of Cochrane Stroke and Cochrane Depression Anxiety and Neurosis, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, five other databases, two clinical trials registers, reference lists and conference proceedings (February 2022), and contacted study authors. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were eligible if they compared pharmacological interventions with placebo; non-invasive brain stimulation with sham stimulation or usual care; psychological therapy with usual care or attention control; pharmacological intervention and psychological therapy with pharmacological intervention and usual care or attention control; pharmacological intervention and non-invasive brain stimulation with pharmacological intervention and sham stimulation or usual care; non-invasive brain stimulation and psychological therapy versus sham brain stimulation or usual care and psychological therapy; pharmacological intervention and psychological therapy with placebo and psychological therapy; pharmacological intervention and non-invasive brain stimulation with placebo and non-invasive brain stimulation; and non-invasive brain stimulation and psychological therapy versus non-invasive brain stimulation and usual care or attention control, with the intention of treating depression after stroke. Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data; we calculated mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous data and risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous data with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), assessed heterogeneity using the I² statistic, and evaluated certainty of evidence according to GRADE. We included 65 trials (72 comparisons) with 5831 participants, with data available for 20 comparisons involving pharmacological interventions, nine for non-invasive brain stimulation, 25 for psychological therapy, three for pharmacological plus psychological therapy, 14 for pharmacological plus non-invasive brain stimulation, and one for non-invasive brain stimulation plus psychological therapy, and no trials for three other comparisons. For pharmacological interventions, very low-certainty evidence from eight trials suggests decreased numbers of people meeting study criteria for depression (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.88; 8 RCTs; 1025 participants) and decreased inadequate response to treatment (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.70; 6 RCTs; 511 participants) compared to placebo, but more adverse events related to the CNS (RR 1.55, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.15; 5 RCTs; 488 participants) and gastrointestinal system (RR 1.62, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.19; 4 RCTs; 473 participants) occurred with pharmacological intervention. For non-invasive brain stimulation, very low-certainty evidence from two trials showed little to no effect on depression or inadequate treatment response compared to sham stimulation. For psychological therapy, very low-certainty evidence from six trials suggests decreased depression prevalence (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.95; 521 participants) compared to usual care/attention control, with no differences in deaths or adverse events. For combined pharmacological and psychological therapy, no trials reported primary outcomes. For pharmacological intervention plus non-invasive brain stimulation, combination therapy reduced depression prevalence (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.91; 3 RCTs; 392 participants; low-certainty evidence) but did not reduce inadequate treatment response (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.30; 3 RCTs; 392 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and very low-certainty evidence from five trials suggested no difference in deaths. No primary outcomes were reported for non-invasive brain stimulation plus psychological therapy. Overall, very low-certainty evidence suggests that pharmacological, psychological, and combination therapies can reduce the prevalence of depression after stroke, while non-invasive brain stimulation has little to no effect, and pharmacological interventions were associated with CNS and gastrointestinal adverse events; more research is required before routine use of such treatments can be recommended.","Do pharmacological treatments, non-invasive brain stimulation (electrodes are placed on the scalp and a finely controlled electric current is applied to change brain activity), psychological treatments, or combination treatments reduce the proportion of people with depression or the extent of depressive symptoms after stroke? Depression is common after stroke yet often is not detected or is inadequately treated. We identified studies by searches conducted on 8 February 2022. This is a living systematic review. We search for new evidence every two months and update the review when we identify relevant new evidence. Please refer to the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for the current status of this review. We included trials that reported on the use of pharmacological, non-invasive brain stimulation, psychological, and combined interventions to treat depression after stroke. We described the main outcomes as the number of people meeting the criteria for depression (scoring above a predefined scoring threshold) and inadequate response (scoring below 50% of the predefined scoring threshold). Average age of participants ranged from 54 to 78 years. Studies were from Asia (39), Europe (12), America (6), South America (1) and Australia (3). We included 65 trials (72 comparisons) involving 5831 participants. Pharmacological treatments resulted in fewer people meeting the study criteria for depression at end of treatment and with inadequate response to treatment. Non-invasive brain stimulation did not reduce the number of people meeting the study criteria for depression at end of treatment and with inadequate response to treatment. Psychological therapy reduced the number of people meeting the study criteria for depression at end of treatment. The combination of pharmacological treatment and non-invasive brain stimulation resulted in fewer people meeting the study criteria for depression but did not affect those with inadequate response to treatment. More people in the pharmacological treatment group reported central nervous system (e.g. confusion, sedation, tremor; in five trials) and gastrointestinal side effects (e.g. constipation, diarrhoea; in four trials) than in the placebo groups. Information on side effects of other treatments was not provided. Estimates of treatment effects were imprecise due to small numbers in most studies and recruitment of people with very different baseline characteristics. We rated the certainty of evidence as low to very low due to these and other limitations in study design. Antidepressant drugs may benefit people with persistent depressive symptoms after stroke, but care is required in their use, as little is known about their effects on overall stroke recovery. Non-invasive brain stimulation may not be of benefit while psychological and combination therapies may offer a treatment option.

616cf9ae07c1c6bd05d95beb,static_2,Donepezil for people with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia in older people. One approach to symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease is to enhance cholinergic neurotransmission in the brain by blocking the action of the enzyme responsible for the breakdown of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. This can be done by a group of drugs known as cholinesterase inhibitors. Donepezil is a cholinesterase inhibitor. This review is an updated version of a review first published in 1998. To assess the clinical efficacy and safety of donepezil in people with mild, moderate or severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease; to compare the efficacy and safety of different doses of donepezil; and to assess the effect of donepezil on healthcare resource use and costs. We searched Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvements Specialized Register, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and a number of other sources on 20 May 2017 to ensure that the search was as comprehensive and up-to-date as possible. In addition, we contacted members of the Donepezil Study Group and Eisai Inc. We included all double-blind, randomised controlled trials in which treatment with donepezil was administered to people with mild, moderate or severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease for 12 weeks or more and its effects compared with those of placebo in a parallel group of patients, or where two different doses of donepezil were compared. One reviewer (JSB) extracted data on cognitive function, activities of daily living, behavioural symptoms, global clinical state, quality of life, adverse events, deaths and healthcare resource costs. Where appropriate and possible, we estimated pooled treatment effects. We used GRADE methods to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome. Thirty studies involving 8257 participants met the inclusion criteria of the review, of which 28 studies reported results in sufficient detail for the meta-analyses. Most studies were of six months' duration or less. Only one small trial lasted 52 weeks. The studies tested mainly donepezil capsules at a dose of 5 mg/day or 10 mg/day. Two studies tested a slow-release oral formulation that delivered 23 mg/day. Participants in 21 studies had mild to moderate disease, in five studies moderate to severe, and in four severe disease. Seventeen studies were industry funded or sponsored, four studies were funded independently of industry and for nine studies there was no information on source of funding. Our main analysis compared the safety and efficacy of donepezil 10 mg/day with placebo at 24 to 26 weeks of treatment. Thirteen studies contributed data from 3396 participants to this analysis. Eleven of these studies were multicentre studies. Seven studies recruited patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease, two with moderate to severe, and four with severe Alzheimer's disease, with a mean age of about 75 years. Almost all evidence was of moderate quality, downgraded due to study limitations. After 26 weeks of treatment, donepezil compared with placebo was associated with better outcomes for cognitive function measured with the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-Cog, range 0 to 70) (mean difference (MD) -2.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.31 to -2.02, 1130 participants, 5 studies), the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score (MD 1.05, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.37, 1757 participants, 7 studies) and the Severe Impairment Battery (SIB, range 0 to 100) (MD 5.92, 95% CI 4.53 to 7.31, 1348 participants, 5 studies). Donepezil was also associated with better function measured with the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study activities of daily living score for severe Alzheimer's disease (ADCS-ADL-sev) (MD 1.03, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.85, 733 participants, 3 studies). A higher proportion of participants treated with donepezil experienced improvement on the clinician-rated global impression of change scale (odds ratio (OR) 1.92, 95% CI 1.54 to 2.39, 1674 participants, 6 studies). There was no difference between donepezil and placebo for behavioural symptoms measured by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) (MD -1.62, 95% CI -3.43 to 0.19, 1035 participants, 4 studies) or by the Behavioural Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease (BEHAVE-AD) scale (MD 0.4, 95% CI -1.28 to 2.08, 194 participants, 1 study). There was also no difference between donepezil and placebo for Quality of Life (QoL) (MD -2.79, 95% CI -8.15 to 2.56, 815 participants, 2 studies). Participants receiving donepezil were more likely to withdraw from the studies before the end of treatment (24% versus 20%, OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.50, 2846 participants, 12 studies) or to experience an adverse event during the studies (72% vs 65%, OR 1.59, 95% 1.31 to 1.95, 2500 participants, 10 studies). There was no evidence of a difference between donepezil and placebo for patient total healthcare resource utilisation. Three studies compared donepezil 10 mg/day to donepezil 5 mg/day over 26 weeks. The 5 mg dose was associated with slightly worse cognitive function on the ADAS-Cog, but not on the MMSE or SIB, with slightly better QoL and with fewer adverse events and withdrawals from treatment. Two studies compared donepezil 10 mg/day to donepezil 23 mg/day. There were no differences on efficacy outcomes, but fewer participants on 10 mg/day experienced adverse events or withdrew from treatment. There is moderate-quality evidence that people with mild, moderate or severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease treated for periods of 12 or 24 weeks with donepezil experience small benefits in cognitive function, activities of daily living and clinician-rated global clinical state. There is some evidence that use of donepezil is neither more nor less expensive compared with placebo when assessing total healthcare resource costs. Benefits on 23 mg/day were no greater than on 10 mg/day, and benefits on the 10 mg/day dose were marginally larger than on the 5 mg/day dose, but the rates of withdrawal and of adverse events before end of treatment were higher the higher the dose.","Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia. As the disease progresses, people lose the ability to remember, communicate, think clearly and perform the activities of daily living. Their behaviour may also change. In severe Alzheimer's disease people lose the ability to care for themselves. The most commonly used treatment for Alzheimer's disease are medicines known as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Donepezil is one of these medicines. It is taken as a pill once a day. In Alzheimer's disease, one of the changes in the brain is a reduced number of nerve cells called cholinergic neurones. These are nerve cells that signal to other cells using a chemical called acetylcholine. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as donepezil, work by preventing acetylcholine from being broken down. This may improve the symptoms of dementia. However, acetylcholine is also found elsewhere in the body and so drugs of this type may have unwanted effects. In this review we examined evidence about benefits and harms from studies that compared donepezil, taken for at least 12 weeks, to placebo (a dummy pill), or that compared different doses of donepezil. The studies had to be double-blind and randomised, that is, the decision whether people taking part got donepezil or placebo had to be made randomly and neither they nor the researchers should have known which treatment they were getting while the trial was going on. This was to make the comparison as unbiased, or fair, as possible. We searched for studies up to May 2017. We assessed the quality of all the studies we included. When it was sensible to do so, we analysed the results of studies together to get an overall result. In general, we thought that the quality of the evidence was moderate. The main factor reducing our confidence was concern that the results of some studies might have been biased by the way they were done. We cannot be sure that the results apply to treatment longer than six months. After six months of treatment, there are benefits of donepezil that are large enough to measure in studies. It is associated with side effects that are mainly mild, but that may cause people to stop treatment. Being able to stabilise cognitive performance or ability to maintain activities of daily living may be important clinically. In terms of total healthcare costs the use of donepezil appears cost neutral. However, there does not appear to be an effect on quality of life. More data are still required from longer-term clinical studies examining measures of disease progression or time to needing full time care.",1127,Alzheimer's disease; dementia; cholinergic neurotransmission; cholinesterase inhibitors; donepezil; acetylcholine,What motivations likely influenced the research focus on the efficacy and safety of donepezil in Alzheimer's treatment?,"In evaluating the effects of different doses of donepezil, what criteria were used to assess its impact?",Select all of the following that are colors,What are the potential limitations in interpreting the study's findings about donepezil's efficacy?,Judge the appropriateness of using donepezil as a treatment in patients with severe Alzheimer's disease based on study outcomes.,The prevalence of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors as a treatment for Alzheimer's.; Need to determine the cost-effectiveness of donepezil compared to other medications.; The potential for donepezil to replace all other Alzheimer's treatments.,The prevalence of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors as a treatment for Alzheimer's.; Need to determine the cost-effectiveness of donepezil compared to other medications.,Cognitive function improvements.; Comparison of behavioral changes between groups.; Differences in patient weight gain.,Cognitive function improvements.; Comparison of behavioral changes between groups.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Evidence based mainly on short-term studies.; Conflict of interest due to industry funding.; Absence of control groups in trials.,Evidence based mainly on short-term studies.; Conflict of interest due to industry funding.,Appropriate due to measurable benefits in cognitive stability.; Inappropriate due to significant adverse effects.; Inappropriate because it leads to rapid disease progression.,Appropriate due to measurable benefits in cognitive stability.
616cf9ae07c1c6bd05d95beb,interactive_3,Splints and other non-surgical methods for treating common injuries of the middle joints of the fingers,"Immobilisation and early motion (protected or unrestricted) are both used following hyperextension injuries to the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint of the finger. The aim of this review was to assess the effects of conservative (non-surgical) interventions for treating hyperextension injuries of the PIP joints. We searched multiple databases and trial registers up to early 2012. Randomised and quasi-randomised studies comparing immobilisation, protected mobilisation, or unrestricted mobilisation in people with non-surgically managed PIP hyperextension injuries were eligible. Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data, but no pooling was possible. Three trials with 366 participants were identified; all were over 15 years old and had methodological weaknesses with unclear or high risk of bias. None reported self-assessed function. One trial compared unrestricted mobility with immobilisation, one compared protected mobilisation with immobilisation, and one compared immobilisation for one week versus three weeks. None found statistically significant differences between groups in poor outcomes, pain, or range of movement at six months, and for the unrestricted-mobility versus immobilisation comparison, no differences were found even at three years. Overall, evidence from trials is insufficient to guide decisions on whether immobilisation is needed, and if so, for how long or to what extent, when treating PIP hyperextension injuries.","Injury to the ligaments of the middle joint (proximal interphalangeal joint) of a finger may occur as a result of the finger being forced backwards. This is known as a hyperextension injury. Characteristically, this occurs in sporting accidents, such as where a football strikes an outstretched hand. These injuries are common and typically affect people of working age. Usually, these patients are treated without surgery using a combination of support (splinting/strapping to the adjacent finger) and exercise advice. Use of the hand is commonly encouraged but restricted to some degree by the severity of the injury. By examining the evidence from randomised controlled trials, this review aimed to assess which treatment for hyperextension injuries of the proximal interphalangeal joints of the fingers results in the best outcome for patients. The outcomes examined included function (including return to work), pain and joint movement.
Three small studies including a total of 366 patients met the inclusion criteria for the review. The studies, which were all over 15 years old, were prone to bias. None of the studies reported any self assessment of function by participants. One study compared unrestricted mobility with immobilisation. One trial compared protected mobilisation (using a removable support in combination with exercise) with immobilisation. The remaining study compared immobilisation for one week versus three weeks. None of these trials found important differences between their intervention groups in various measures of poor outcome, pain and range of movement at six months follow-up.
We concluded that there was a lack of robust evidence to inform on the need for, and the extent and duration of, immobilisation for these injuries.",1055,immobilisation; hyperextension injuries; proximal interphalangeal joint; conservative interventions; protected mobilisation; unrestricted mobilisation; self-assessed function; range of movement; unrestricted mobility,What types of injuries are hyperextension injuries of the proximal interphalangeal joint?,What was the motivation behind the review?,Select all of the following that are colors,Which methods of conservative treatment were compared in the studies?,Summarize the results reported regarding differences in outcomes between intervention groups.,Ligament injuries from finger hyperextension; Fractures to the fingertip; Tendon injuries from bending,Ligament injuries from finger hyperextension,To find the best non-surgical treatment for finger hyperextension injuries; To promote surgical interventions for all finger injuries; To explore all possible injuries to the hand,To find the best non-surgical treatment for finger hyperextension injuries,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Unrestricted mobility vs. immobilisation; Only surgery vs. non-surgery; Protected mobilisation vs. medication,Unrestricted mobility vs. immobilisation,No important differences found; Significant outcomes in terms of recovery; Minor differences but not statistically significant,No important differences found; Minor differences but not statistically significant
616cf9ae07c1c6bd05d95beb,interactive_4,Quality improvement strategies for diabetes care: Effects on outcomes for adults living with diabetes,"There is a large body of evidence evaluating quality improvement (QI) programmes to improve care for adults living with diabetes. These programmes are often comprised of multiple QI strategies, which may be implemented in various combinations. Decision-makers planning to implement or evaluate a new QI programme, or both, need reliable evidence on the relative effectiveness of different QI strategies (individually and in combination) for different patient populations.
To update existing systematic reviews of diabetes QI programmes and apply novel meta-analytical techniques to estimate the effectiveness of QI strategies (individually and in combination) on diabetes quality of care.
We searched databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL) and trials registers (ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP) to 4 June 2019. We conducted a top-up search to 23 September 2021; we screened these search results and 42 studies meeting our eligibility criteria are available in the awaiting classification section.
We included randomised trials that assessed a QI programme to improve care in outpatient settings for people living with diabetes. QI programmes needed to evaluate at least one system- or provider-targeted QI strategy alone or in combination with a patient-targeted strategy. - System-targeted: case management (CM); team changes (TC); electronic patient registry (EPR); facilitated relay of clinical information (FR); continuous quality improvement (CQI). - Provider-targeted: audit and feedback (AF); clinician education (CE); clinician reminders (CR); financial incentives (FI). - Patient-targeted: patient education (PE); promotion of self-management (PSM); patient reminders (PR). Patient-targeted QI strategies needed to occur with a minimum of one provider or system-targeted strategy.
We dual-screened search results and abstracted data on study design, study population and QI strategies. We assessed the impact of the programmes on 13 measures of diabetes care, including: glycaemic control (e.g. mean glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c)); cardiovascular risk factor management (e.g. mean systolic blood pressure (SBP), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), proportion of people living with diabetes that quit smoking or receiving cardiovascular medications); and screening/prevention of microvascular complications (e.g. proportion of patients receiving retinopathy or foot screening); and harms (e.g. proportion of patients experiencing adverse hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia). We modelled the association of each QI strategy with outcomes using a series of hierarchical multivariable meta-regression models in a Bayesian framework. The previous version of this review identified that different strategies were more or less effective depending on baseline levels of outcomes. To explore this further, we extended the main additive model for continuous outcomes (HbA1c, SBP and LDL-C) to include an interaction term between each strategy and average baseline risk for each study (baseline thresholds were based on a data-driven approach; we used the median of all baseline values reported in the trials). Based on model diagnostics, the baseline interaction models for HbA1c, SBP and LDL-C performed better than the main model and are therefore presented as the primary analyses for these outcomes. Based on the model results, we qualitatively ordered each QI strategy within three tiers (Top, Middle, Bottom) based on its magnitude of effect relative to the other QI strategies, where 'Top' indicates that the QI strategy was likely one of the most effective strategies for that specific outcome. Secondary analyses explored the sensitivity of results to choices in model specification and priors. Additional information about the methods and results of the review are available as Appendices in an online repository. This review will be maintained as a living systematic review; we will update our syntheses as more data become available.
We identified 553 trials (428 patient-randomised and 125 cluster-randomised trials), including a total of 412,161 participants. Of the included studies, 66% involved people living with type 2 diabetes only. Participants were 50% female and the median age of participants was 58.4 years. The mean duration of follow-up was 12.5 months. HbA1c was the commonest reported outcome; screening outcomes and outcomes related to cardiovascular medications, smoking and harms were reported infrequently. The most frequently evaluated QI strategies across all study arms were PE, PSM and CM, while the least frequently evaluated QI strategies included AF, FI and CQI. Our confidence in the evidence is limited due to a lack of information on how studies were conducted. Four QI strategies (CM, TC, PE, PSM) were consistently identified as 'Top' across the majority of outcomes. All QI strategies were ranked as 'Top' for at least one key outcome. The majority of effects of individual QI strategies were modest, but when used in combination could result in meaningful population-level improvements across the majority of outcomes. The median number of QI strategies in multicomponent QI programmes was three. Combinations of the three most effective QI strategies were estimated to lead to the below effects: - PR + PSM + CE: decrease in HbA1c by 0.41% (credibility interval (CrI) -0.61 to -0.22) when baseline HbA1c < 8.3%; - CM + PE + EPR: decrease in HbA1c by 0.62% (CrI -0.84 to -0.39) when baseline HbA1c > 8.3%; - PE + TC + PSM: reduction in SBP by 2.14 mmHg (CrI -3.80 to -0.52) when baseline SBP < 136 mmHg; - CM + TC + PSM: reduction in SBP by 4.39 mmHg (CrI -6.20 to -2.56) when baseline SBP > 136 mmHg; - TC + PE + CM: LDL-C lowering of 5.73 mg/dL (CrI -7.93 to -3.61) when baseline LDL < 107 mg/dL; - TC + CM + CR: LDL-C lowering by 5.52 mg/dL (CrI -9.24 to -1.89) when baseline LDL > 107 mg/dL. Assuming a baseline screening rate of 50%, the three most effective QI strategies were estimated to lead to an absolute improvement of 33% in retinopathy screening (PE + PR + TC) and 38% absolute increase in foot screening (PE + TC + Other).
There is a significant body of evidence about QI programmes to improve the management of diabetes. Multicomponent QI programmes for diabetes care (comprised of effective QI strategies) may achieve meaningful population-level improvements across the majority of outcomes. For health system decision-makers, the evidence summarised in this review can be used to identify strategies to include in QI programmes. For researchers, this synthesis identifies higher-priority QI strategies to examine in further research regarding how to optimise their evaluation and effects. We will maintain this as a living systematic review.","Diabetes, a disorder of how sugar is managed by the body, can lead to complications such as heart disease and blindness. If people with diabetes get the best possible treatment, their risk for these and other diabetes-related complications will be lowered. Unfortunately, many people with diabetes do not get the best possible treatment.
Quality improvement programmes using different strategies help healthcare professionals improve care. We examined 12 common types of quality improvement strategies.
- Four strategies were directed at healthcare professionals: audit and feedback, clinician education, clinician reminders and financial incentives.
- Three strategies were directed at people living with diabetes: patient education, patient reminders and promotion of self-management.
- Five strategies involved healthcare organisations: case management, team changes, electronic patient registry, facilitated relay of clinical information and continuous quality improvement.
We wanted to find out which strategies worked best to improve:
- blood sugar control (measured using a test called glycated haemoglobin or HbA1c);
- blood pressure;
- low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C).
Lower levels on these tests are associated with lower rates of complications such as heart attacks.
We also assessed whether quality improvement strategies improved rates of screening for eye damage (also known as retinopathy) and loss of sensation in the foot (also known as neuropathy). Routine screening for these issues in people living with diabetes is recommended to prevent blindness or amputation, respectively.
We searched for randomised trials including adults living with diabetes managed in outpatient settings, which evaluated at least one quality improvement strategy. Although we were interested in strategies directed at people living with diabetes, patient strategies needed to be tested in combination with strategies directed at healthcare organisations or professionals for the study to be included. We summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods, size and other considerations.
We found 553 studies that involved 412,161 people with diabetes up to the year 2019. Studies took place in countries around the world with most being conducted in the USA (231) and in medical settings.
Most studies (367) involved people with type 2 diabetes. Half of the study participants were female. The average age of participants was 57 years. Most studies lasted 12 months.
Studies usually used multiple quality improvement strategies together. Most commonly, studies featured three quality improvement strategies.
Overall, case management, team changes, patient education and promotion of self-management appeared to be the most effective quality improvement strategies for diabetes care.
When considering three-strategy combinations (the median number of quality improvement strategies in multicomponent interventions), the combination of clinician education, promotion of self-management and patient reminders may lead to the most improvement in blood sugar control in people who begin with lower HbA1c. Whereas the combination of case management, patient education and electronic patient registries may lead to the largest improvement in blood sugar control for people who begin with higher HbA1c.
For blood pressure, people who have lower systolic blood pressure may see the most improvement with the combination of patient education, team changes and promotion of self-management. People who have higher systolic blood pressure may improve the most with the combination of case management, team changes and promotion of self-management.
For cholesterol, we found that team changes, patient education and case management may lead to the most improvement in people who already have lower low-density lipoprotein levels. For those who have higher levels of low-density lipoprotein, team changes, case management and clinician reminders may lead to the largest improvement.
Patient education, patient reminders and team changes may lead to an increase in retinopathy screening rates. Patient education, team changes and audit and feedback, financial incentives and continuous quality improvement strategies combined may lead to an increase in foot screening rates.
Clinics can improve their diabetes care by engaging in quality improvement programmes (especially those including case management, team changes, patient education and patient self-management).
Many studies did not provide information on everything we were interested in. Most focused on blood sugar control and few studies reported screening rates. We included studies in this review that had important flaws in the way they were conducted, which limits how confident we can be in our findings.
The evidence for this review is up-to-date to June 2019, and we have further searched for and screened studies up to September 2021.

616cf9ae07c1c6bd05d95beb,interactive_4,Do physical measures such as hand-washing or wearing masks stop or slow down the spread of respiratory viruses?,"Viral epidemics or pandemics of acute respiratory infections (ARIs) pose a global threat, such as the influenza (H1N1) pandemic in 2009 caused by the H1N1pdm09 virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 in 2019, and antiviral drugs and vaccines may be insufficient to prevent their spread; this is an update of a Cochrane Review last published in 2020 and includes results from studies conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. The objective was to assess the effectiveness of physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of acute respiratory viruses. We searched CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and two trials registers in October 2022, with backward and forward citation analysis. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-RCTs investigating physical interventions (screening at entry ports, isolation, quarantine, physical distancing, personal protection, hand hygiene, face masks, glasses, and gargling) to prevent respiratory virus transmission, and used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We included 11 new RCTs and cluster-RCTs (610,872 participants), bringing the total to 78; six were conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic (two from Mexico, and one each from Denmark, Bangladesh, England, and Norway), and we identified four ongoing studies, one completed but unreported, evaluating masks during COVID-19. Many studies were conducted during non-epidemic influenza periods, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, or influenza seasons up to 2016, meaning many occurred under lower viral circulation compared with COVID-19; settings varied widely, from suburban schools to hospital wards in high-income countries, crowded inner-city areas in low-income countries, and an immigrant neighbourhood in a high-income country, and adherence to interventions was low in many studies, with risk of bias mostly high or unclear. We included 12 trials comparing medical/surgical masks versus no masks (two in healthcare workers and 10 in the community); wearing masks in the community probably makes little or no difference in influenza-like illness/COVID-like illness compared to not wearing masks (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.09; 9 trials, 276,917 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and probably makes little or no difference in laboratory-confirmed influenza/SARS-CoV-2 (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.42; 6 trials, 13,919 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), with harms rarely measured. For N95/P2 respirators compared to medical/surgical masks, pooled trials (four in healthcare settings and one in a household) show very uncertain effects on clinical respiratory illness (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.10; 3 trials, 7779 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and they may be effective for ILI (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.03; 5 trials, 8407 participants; low-certainty evidence); for laboratory-confirmed influenza, N95/P2 respirators probably make little or no difference (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.34; 5 trials, 8407 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Restricting analyses to healthcare workers made no difference; harms were poorly measured, though discomfort was reported. One recently published RCT found medical/surgical masks non-inferior to N95 respirators in 1009 healthcare workers across four countries treating COVID-19 patients. For hand hygiene, 19 trials compared interventions with controls across schools, childcare centres, and homes; hand hygiene resulted in a 14% relative reduction in ARIs (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.90; 9 trials, 52,105 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), reducing cases from 380 to 327 per 1000 people. For ILI (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.09; 11 trials, 34,503 participants; low-certainty evidence) and laboratory-confirmed influenza (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.30; 8 trials, 8332 participants; low-certainty evidence), effects suggested little or no difference. Pooled data from 19 trials (71,210 participants) for ARI/ILI/influenza found hand hygiene may be beneficial with an 11% relative reduction (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.94; low-certainty evidence), though with high heterogeneity; harms were rarely reported. No RCTs were found for gowns and gloves, face shields, or screening at entry ports. The high risk of bias, variation in outcome measurement, and low adherence hinder firm conclusions; additional RCTs during the pandemic existed but were relatively few despite the importance of evaluating masking and adherence, especially in vulnerable groups. There remains uncertainty about the effects of face masks, with low to moderate certainty meaning confidence is limited and true effects may differ; pooled RCTs did not show a clear reduction in respiratory viral infection with medical/surgical masks, and no clear difference was seen between medical/surgical masks and N95/P2 respirators in healthcare workers providing routine care. Hand hygiene is likely to modestly reduce respiratory illness, though not significantly for ILI or laboratory-confirmed influenza. Harms were under-investigated. There is a need for large, well-designed RCTs across multiple settings and populations to evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions and the impact of adherence, especially among those at highest risk of ARIs.","Respiratory viruses are viruses that infect the cells in your airways: nose, throat, and lungs and these infections can cause serious problems and affect normal breathing, leading to illnesses such as flu (influenza), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and COVID-19. People infected with a respiratory virus spread virus particles into the air when they cough or sneeze, and others become infected if they come into contact with these particles in the air or on surfaces; respiratory viruses can spread quickly through communities, populations, countries (causing epidemics), and around the world (causing pandemics). Physical measures to try to prevent respiratory viruses spreading include washing hands often; not touching your eyes, nose, or mouth; sneezing or coughing into your elbow; wiping surfaces with disinfectant; wearing masks, eye protection, gloves, and gowns; avoiding contact with other people (isolation or quarantine); keeping a distance from others; and screening people entering a country for signs of infection. We wanted to find out whether physical measures stop or slow the spread of respiratory viruses from well-controlled randomised controlled trials comparing one intervention to another. We searched for randomised controlled studies that looked at physical measures to stop people acquiring a respiratory virus infection and were interested in how many people caught a respiratory virus infection and whether the physical measures had unwanted effects. We identified 78 relevant studies conducted in low-, middle-, and high-income countries in hospitals, schools, homes, offices, childcare centres, and communities during non-epidemic influenza periods, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, influenza seasons up to 2016, and during the COVID-19 pandemic; five ongoing, unpublished studies were found, two evaluating masks for COVID-19, with five trials funded by government and pharmaceutical companies, and nine funded by pharmaceutical companies. No studies looked at face shields, gowns and gloves, or screening at borders. We assessed the effects of medical or surgical masks, N95/P2 respirators (close-fitting masks filtering inhaled air, mostly used by healthcare workers), and hand hygiene (hand-washing or hand sanitiser). For medical or surgical masks, ten studies took place in the community and two in healthcare workers; compared with wearing no mask (community studies only), wearing a mask may make little to no difference in how many people caught a flu-like or COVID-like illness (9 studies; 276,917 people), and probably makes little or no difference in how many had flu or COVID confirmed by a lab test (6 studies; 13,919 people), with discomfort rarely reported. For N95/P2 respirators, four studies were in healthcare workers and one small study in the community; compared with wearing surgical masks, N95/P2 respirators probably make little to no difference in confirmed flu (5 studies; 8407 people) and may make little to no difference in flu-like illness (5 studies; 8407 people) or respiratory illness (3 studies; 7799 people), with discomfort mentioned. For hand hygiene, following a hand hygiene programme may reduce respiratory or flu-like illness or confirmed flu compared with no programme (19 studies; 71,210 people), although the reduction was not statistically confirmed when ILI and lab-confirmed ILI were analysed separately; few studies measured unwanted effects, with skin irritation from sanitiser mentioned. Our confidence in these results is generally low to moderate for subjective outcomes such as respiratory illness, but moderate for more precise laboratory-confirmed infection outcomes related to masks and N95/P2 respirators; results may change with more evidence, and adherence to mask-wearing and hand hygiene was relatively low, which may have affected study outcomes.",1111,acute respiratory infections (ARIs); SARS-CoV-2; H1N1pdm09 virus; severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS); N95/P2 respirators; laboratory-confirmed influenza; influenza-like illness (ILI); physical interventions; antiviral drugs; viral epidemics,What can be deduced about the effectiveness of physical interventions such as masks in different settings from the studyÃ¢ÂÂs findings?,What criteria can be used to evaluate the reliability of the study's conclusions about the use of hand hygiene?,Select all of the following that are fruits,What are the implications of the studyÃ¢ÂÂs findings for the future design of respiratory virus prevention trials?,How could the limited findings on harms associated with interventions impact public health policies?,Masks show consistent effectiveness across all settings.; Effectiveness of masks is inconsistent across different settings.; Masks are ineffective in low-income settings.,Effectiveness of masks is inconsistent across different settings.,The number of trials and participants involved in the hand hygiene studies.; The consistency of outcomes across different respiratory diseases.; The number of different viruses tested in isolation settings only.,The number of trials and participants involved in the hand hygiene studies.; The consistency of outcomes across different respiratory diseases.,dog; blue; grape,grape,Designing trials with a focus on heterogeneous settings and high adherence to interventions.; Excluding healthcare worker settings to focus on community settings only.; Including a wider range of physical interventions besides masks and hand hygiene.,Designing trials with a focus on heterogeneous settings and high adherence to interventions.; Including a wider range of physical interventions besides masks and hand hygiene.,Policies may proceed cautiously due to potential undisclosed harms.; Limited harm reporting justifies the unrestricted use of interventions.; It necessitates further research to guide evidence-based policy decisions.,Policies may proceed cautiously due to potential undisclosed harms.; It necessitates further research to guide evidence-based policy decisions.
616cf9ae07c1c6bd05d95beb,finetuned_5,Interventions to prevent asthma attacks in children upon return to school in the autumn,"Asthma exacerbations in school-aged children peak in autumn shortly after they return to school, likely due to factors such as poor treatment adherence, increased allergen and viral exposure, and changes in immune tolerance. Because this seasonal peak is predictable occurring in September in the Northern Hemisphere and February in the Southern Hemisphere targeted interventions may help reduce exacerbations and lessen the strain on health services. This review assessed the effects of pharmacological and behavioural interventions implemented before school return to reduce autumn asthma exacerbations in children. We searched major trial registries and databases up to 1 December 2017, with no language restrictions. We included randomised controlled trials comparing pre-autumn interventions with usual care in children aged 18 years or younger. Standard Cochrane methods were used for study selection, data extraction, and bias assessment. The primary outcome was the proportion of children experiencing an asthma exacerbation requiring hospitalisation or oral corticosteroids during autumn. Of 546 trials screened, five met the inclusion criteria, enrolling 14,252 children. All studies were conducted in the Northern Hemisphere. Three interventions used leukotriene receptor antagonists, one used omalizumab or an inhaled corticosteroid boost, and the largest study (12,179 children) used a medication reminder letter. Although individual studies generally had low risk of bias, the evidence quality was downgraded due to imprecision, inconsistency, and indirect outcome measurement. Only one US study involving 513 children with asthma and allergic sensitisation reported data for the primary outcome. In this study, exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids or hospitalisation within 90 days of school return were reduced to 11.3% in the omalizumab group compared with 21.0% in the placebo group. The other studies used different exacerbation definitions. A pooled analysis of two leukotriene receptor antagonist trials found no effect on exacerbations, and the reminder-letter intervention did not reduce unscheduled respiratory healthcare contacts between September and December. Four studies reported adverse events, with no evidence of differences between intervention and usual care groups. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were not possible due to insufficient data. Seasonal omalizumab treatment starting four to six weeks before school return may reduce autumn asthma exacerbations, with no increase in adverse effects aside from injection site pain, although the treatment is costly. There was no evidence regarding effects on asthma control, quality of life, or mortality. Future trials should clearly define exacerbations, standardise outcome measures, and carefully characterise participants to allow analysis of subgroup effects.","Asthma is a long-term condition affecting the lungs. It is the most common long-term condition affecting children. One in 11 children in the United Kingdom have asthma. People with asthma can experience asthma 'attacks' of coughing, wheezing, and difficulty breathing. Each year there is a peak in asthma attacks after school restarts in autumn. The likely reason for this is that children are exposed to more viruses that can trigger asthma. Children may also have taken their regular medication less consistently with the break in routine over the summer. As this increase in attacks at the start of the school year is predictable, and the reason for it is somewhat understood, it might be preventable. Approaches to reducing autumn asthma attacks include using extra medications when school restarts or medication reminders during the school holiday. Our searches found 546 trials, of which five were relevant. In total, 14,252 children were randomly assigned to receive either an intervention targeting autumn asthma attacks or usual care. Four small studies (approximately 200 to 1200 children in each) gave children extra asthma medication; these additional medications were omalizumab, leukotriene receptor antagonist tablets, or increased doses of inhaled steroids. One study sent a medication reminder letter over the summer holidays to parents of children with asthma. One trial gave children either omalizumab or placebo. Omalizumab is an antibody designed to alter the immune response. It was given by injection regularly over four to six weeks before school return (i.e. over the bulk of the summer holidays). The children in this study had known allergic asthma. The study showed that omalizumab might reduce autumn attacks. Eleven per cent of those receiving omalizumab had an asthma attack during the first 90 days compared to 21% of those receiving placebo. Three studies used leukotriene receptor antagonist tablets, either montelukast or pranlukast. Although the results of one study suggested that seasonal montelukast might reduce autumn attacks, there was no evidence of reduced attacks in the other two later trials, including a second larger trial of montelukast. There was no evidence that sending a reminder letter reduces the number of children requiring an unplanned healthcare contact. No study provided evidence that the total number of children experiencing adverse events was greater in the intervention than in the usual care group. Our findings were limited by the small numbers of studies identified and because these studies used different interventions and definitions of asthma exacerbations. Further research is needed to better understand how to prevent seasonal attacks, including interventions suitable for children with mild asthma, where expensive and painful treatments are not justified.",1078,asthma exacerbations; allergic sensitisation; leukotriene receptor antagonists; omalizumab; inhaled corticosteroid boost; oral corticosteroids; placebo group; unscheduled respiratory healthcare contacts; adverse events; asthma control,How do the various interventions compare in their effectiveness to reduce autumn asthma attacks?,What was the primary purpose of the study discussed in the summary?,Select all of the following that are fruits,How did the seasonal omalizumab treatment affect asthma exacerbations in the study?,What problem is associated with the increase of asthma attacks in autumn?,Omalizumab proved more effective than leukotriene receptor antagonists.; The medication reminder letter showed the highest reduction in attacks.; All interventions showed equal effectiveness.,Omalizumab proved more effective than leukotriene receptor antagonists.,To assess the effects of pre-autumn interventions on asthma exacerbations in children.; To find new medications for asthma treatment.; To study summer activities of children with asthma.,To assess the effects of pre-autumn interventions on asthma exacerbations in children.,dog; blue; grape,grape,Reduced exacerbations by 11%; Reduced exacerbations to 11% of occurrences; Increased exacerbations by 21%,Reduced exacerbations to 11% of occurrences,Increased contact with triggers such as viruses; Children change their class schedules; Decrease in temperatures leading to cold symptoms,Increased contact with triggers such as viruses
616cf9ae07c1c6bd05d95beb,finetuned_6,Does vitamin D reduce risk of severe asthma attacks or improve control of asthma symptoms?,"Since the previous Cochrane Review on this topic in 2016, debate has continued surrounding a potential role for vitamin D in reducing risk of asthma exacerbation and improving asthma control. We therefore conducted an updated meta-analysis to include data from new trials completed since this date. To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of administration of vitamin D or its hydroxylated metabolites in reducing the risk of severe asthma exacerbations (defined as those requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids) and improving asthma symptom control. We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Trial Register and reference lists of articles. We contacted the authors of studies in order to identify additional trials. Date of last search: 8 September 2022. We included double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials of vitamin D in children and adults with asthma evaluating exacerbation risk or asthma symptom control, or both. Four review authors independently applied study inclusion criteria, extracted the data, and assessed risk of bias. We obtained missing data from the authors where possible. We reported results with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The primary outcome was the incidence of severe asthma exacerbations requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of asthma exacerbations precipitating an emergency department visit or requiring hospital admission, or both, end-study childhood Asthma Control Test (cACT) or Asthma Control Test (ACT) scores, and end-study % predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1). We performed subgroup analyses to determine whether the effect of vitamin D on risk of asthma exacerbation was modified by baseline vitamin D status, vitamin D dose, frequency of dosing regimen, form of vitamin D given, and age of participants. We included 20 studies in this review; 15 trials involving a total of 1155 children and five trials involving a total of 1070 adults contributed data to analyses. Participant ages ranged from 1 to 84 years, with two trials providing data specific to participants under five years (n = 69) and eight trials providing data specific to participants aged 5 to 16 (n = 766). Across the trials, 1245 participants were male and 1229 were female, with two studies not reporting sex distribution. Fifteen trials contributed to the primary outcome analysis of exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids. The duration of trials ranged from three to 40 months; all but two investigated effects of administering cholecalciferol (vitamin D3). As in the previous Cochrane Review, the majority of participants had mild to moderate asthma, and profound vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) < 25 nmol/L) at baseline was rare. Administration of vitamin D or its hydroxylated metabolites did not reduce or increase the proportion of participants experiencing one or more asthma exacerbations treated with systemic corticosteroids (odds ratio (OR) 1.04, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.34; I2= 0%; 14 studies, 1778 participants; high-quality evidence). This equates to an absolute risk of 226 per 1000 (95% CI 185 to 273) in the pooled vitamin D group, compared to a baseline risk of 219 participants per 1000 in the pooled placebo group. We also found no effect of vitamin D supplementation on the rate of exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids (rate ratio 0.86, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.19; I2= 60%; 10 studies, 1599 participants; high-quality evidence), or the time to first exacerbation (hazard ratio 0.82, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.15; I2= 22%; 3 studies, 850 participants; high-quality evidence). Subgroup analysis did not reveal any evidence of effect modification by baseline vitamin D status, vitamin D dose, frequency of dosing regimen, or age. A single trial investigating administration of calcidiol reported a benefit of the intervention for the primary outcome of asthma control. Vitamin D supplementation did not influence any secondary efficacy outcome meta-analysed, which were all based on moderate- or high-quality evidence. We observed no effect on the incidence of serious adverse events (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.41; I2= 0%; 12 studies, 1556 participants; high-quality evidence). The effect of vitamin D on fatal asthma exacerbations was not estimable, as no such events occurred in any trial. Six studies reported adverse reactions potentially attributable to vitamin D. These occurred across treatment and control arms and included hypercalciuria, hypervitaminosis D, kidney stones, gastrointestinal symptoms and mild itch. In one trial, we could not ascertain the total number of participants with hypercalciuria from the trial report. We assessed three trials as being at high risk of bias in at least one domain; none of these contributed data to the analysis of the outcomes reported above. Sensitivity analyses that excluded these trials from each outcome to which they contributed did not change the null findings. In contrast to findings of our previous Cochrane Review on this topic, this updated review does not find evidence to support a role for vitamin D supplementation or its hydroxylated metabolites to reduce risk of asthma exacerbations or improve asthma control. Participants with severe asthma and those with baseline 25(OH)D concentrations < 25 nmol/L were poorly represented, so further research is warranted here. A single study investigating effects of calcidiol yielded positive results, so further studies investigating effects of this metabolite are needed.","Low blood levels of vitamin D, (the 'sunshine vitamin')  have been linked to an increased risk of severe asthma attacks requiring oral steroid medications. A 2016 Cochrane Review found that vitamin D reduced the risk of such attacks, but later trials reported mixed results, so we updated the meta-analysis to include newer studies. We aimed to determine whether vitamin D supplementation reduces severe asthma attacks, improves asthma symptom control, or causes negative side effects. We searched for randomized controlled trials assessing the impact of vitamin D supplements on severe asthma attacks and symptom control, summarized the findings, and rated confidence in the evidence based on study quality. We also examined whether effects differed according to baseline vitamin D levels, supplement type and dose, dosing frequency, or participant age. We included 20 trials involving 2225 people; nine had been included in the previous review, and 11 were new. Fifteen studies reported data on severe asthma attacks. Trials lasted from three to 40 months, and all but two used cholecalciferol (vitamin D3), the most common supplement form. Across studies, vitamin D supplements did not reduce the risk of severe asthma attacks compared with placebo. Supplementation also did not improve asthma control, breathing capacity, or risk of serious side effects. Evidence has important limitations: people with severe asthma and those with very low vitamin D levels before treatment were poorly represented, so it is unclear whether this group might benefit. One study testing calcidiol, a different form of vitamin D, found a protective effect, suggesting that this alternative form may warrant further research.",1079,vitamin D; asthma exacerbations; systemic corticosteroids; cholecalciferol; 25-hydroxyvitamin D; calcidiol; asthma control; forced expiratory volume in one second; hypercalciuria; hypervitaminosis D,How do the study findings relate to the previous Cochrane Review on vitamin D's role in asthma management?,What was the primary aim of the study regarding vitamin D supplementation?,Select all of the following that are colors,Identify which group was underrepresented in the trials according to the summary.,Summarize the overall findings of the study regarding vitamin D supplementation on asthma control.,The updated review confirmed the previous review's findings.; The updated review contradicted the previous review's findings.; The updated review expanded on new areas not covered by the previous review.,The updated review contradicted the previous review's findings.; The updated review expanded on new areas not covered by the previous review.,To assess the impact on severe asthma attacks.; To evaluate the improvement in blood sugar control.; To improve bone density in adults.,To assess the impact on severe asthma attacks.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,People with severe asthma.; People with high blood pressure.; Young children without asthma.,People with severe asthma.,It had no significant effect on asthma control.; It significantly improved asthma symptoms.; It worsened asthma symptoms.,It had no significant effect on asthma control.
616cf9ae07c1c6bd05d95beb,finetuned_6,Electrical shocks (electrical cardioversion) and drugs (pharmacological cardioversion) for restoring normal rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most frequent sustained arrhythmia. Cardioversion is a rhythm control strategy to restore normal/sinus rhythm, and can be achieved through drugs (pharmacological) or a synchronised electric shock (electrical cardioversion).
To assess the efficacy and safety of pharmacological and electrical cardioversion for atrial fibrillation (AF), atrial flutter and atrial tachycardias.
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science (CPCI-S) and three trials registers (ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP and ISRCTN) on 14 February 2023.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) at the individual patient level. Patient populations were aged ?  18 years with AF of any type and duration, atrial flutter or other sustained related atrial arrhythmias, not occurring as a result of reversible causes.
We used standard Cochrane methodology to collect data and performed a network meta-analysis using the standard frequentist graph-theoretical approach using the netmeta package in R. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence which we presented in our summary of findings with a judgement on certainty. We calculated differences using risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) as well as ranking treatments using a P value. We assessed clinical and statistical heterogeneity and split the networks for the primary outcome and acute procedural success, due to concerns about violating the transitivity assumption.
We included 112 RCTs (139 records), from which we pooled data from 15,968 patients. The average age ranged from 47 to 72 years and the proportion of male patients ranged from 38% to 92%. Seventy-nine trials were considered to be at high risk of bias for at least one domain, 32 had no high risk of bias domains, but had at least one domain classified as uncertain risk, and one study was considered at low risk for all domains. For paroxysmal AF (35 trials), when compared to placebo, anteroapical (AA)/anteroposterior (AP) biphasic truncated exponential waveform (BTE) cardioversion (RR: 2.42; 95% CI 1.65 to 3.56), quinidine (RR: 2.23; 95% CI 1.49 to 3.34), ibutilide (RR: 2.00; 95% CI 1.28 to 3.12), propafenone (RR: 1.98; 95% CI 1.67 to 2.34), amiodarone (RR: 1.69; 95% CI 1.42 to 2.02), sotalol (RR: 1.58; 95% CI 1.08 to 2.31) and procainamide (RR: 1.49; 95% CI 1.13 to 1.97) likely result in a large increase in maintenance of sinus rhythm until hospital discharge or end of study follow-up (certainty of evidence: moderate). The effect size was larger for AA/AP incremental and was progressively smaller for the subsequent interventions. Despite low certainty of evidence, antazoline may result in a large increase (RR: 28.60; 95% CI 1.77 to 461.30) in this outcome. Similarly, low-certainty evidence suggests a large increase in this outcome for flecainide (RR: 2.17; 95% CI 1.68 to 2.79), vernakalant (RR: 2.13; 95% CI 1.52 to 2.99), and magnesium (RR: 1.73; 95% CI 0.79 to 3.79). For persistent AF (26 trials), one network was created for electrical cardioversion and showed that, when compared to AP BTE incremental energy with patches, AP BTE maximum energy with patches (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.55) likely results in a large increase, and active compression AP BTE incremental energy with patches (RR: 1.14, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.131) likely results in an increase in maintenance of sinus rhythm at hospital discharge or end of study follow-up (certainty of evidence: high). Use of AP BTE incremental with paddles (RR: 1.03, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.09; certainty of evidence: low) may lead to a slight increase, and AP MDS Incremental paddles (RR: 0.95, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.05; certainty of evidence: low) may lead to a slight decrease in efficacy. On the other hand, AP MDS incremental energy using patches (RR: 0.78, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.87), AA RBW incremental energy with patches (RR: 0.76, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.88), AP RBW incremental energy with patches (RR: 0.76, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.86), AA MDS incremental energy with patches (RR: 0.76, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.86) and AA MDS incremental energy with paddles (RR: 0.68, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.83) probably result in a decrease in this outcome when compared to AP BTE incremental energy with patches (certainty of evidence: moderate). The network for pharmacological cardioversion showed that bepridil (RR: 2.29, 95% CI 1.26 to 4.17) and quindine (RR: 1.53, (95% CI 1.01 to 2.32) probably result in a large increase in maintenance of sinus rhythm at hospital discharge or end of study follow-up when compared to amiodarone (certainty of evidence: moderate). Dofetilide (RR: 0.79, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.44), sotalol (RR: 0.89, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.18), propafenone (RR: 0.79, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.25) and pilsicainide (RR: 0.39, 95% CI 0.02 to 7.01) may result in a reduction in this outcome when compared to amiodarone, but the certainty of evidence is low. For atrial flutter (14 trials), a network could be created only for antiarrhythmic drugs. Using placebo as the common comparator, ibutilide (RR: 21.45, 95% CI 4.41 to 104.37), propafenone (RR: 7.15, 95% CI 1.27 to 40.10), dofetilide (RR: 6.43, 95% CI 1.38 to 29.91), and sotalol (RR: 6.39, 95% CI 1.03 to 39.78) probably result in a large increase in the maintenance of sinus rhythm at hospital discharge or end of study follow-up (certainty of evidence: moderate), and procainamide (RR: 4.29, 95% CI 0.63 to 29.03), flecainide (RR 3.57, 95% CI 0.24 to 52.30) and vernakalant (RR: 1.18, 95% CI 0.05 to 27.37) may result in a large increase in maintenance of sinus rhythm at hospital discharge or end of study follow-up (certainty of evidence: low). All tested electrical cardioversion strategies for atrial flutter had very high efficacy (97.9% to 100%). The rate of mortality (14 deaths) and stroke or systemic embolism (3 events) at 30 days was extremely low. Data on quality of life were scarce and of uncertain clinical significance. No information was available regarding heart failure readmissions. Data on duration of hospitalisation was scarce, of low quality, and could not be pooled.
Despite the low quality of evidence, this systematic review provides important information on electrical and pharmacological strategies to help patients and physicians deal with AF and atrial flutter. In the assessment of the patient comorbidity profile, antiarrhythmic drug onset of action and side effect profile versus the need for a physician with experience in sedation, or anaesthetics support for electrical cardioversion are key aspects when choosing the cardioversion method.","AF is the most frequent abnormal heart rhythm seen in the world. Patients with this condition may feel their heart beating rapidly and irregularly. This can occur for separate brief or long episodes (paroxysmal AF) or it may become continuous (persistent AF). Atrial flutter is a similar abnormal rhythm that causes similar symptoms, can cause episodes of variable duration and can also become continuous.
Cardioversion is a treatment to restore the rhythm of the heart back to normal (sinus rhythm).
We wanted to know if delivering a controlled electrical shock (i.e. electrical cardioversion) and drugs (i.e. pharmacological cardioversion) are effective and safe when restoring heart rhythm back to normal.
We searched for studies that investigated electrical and pharmacological cardioversion compared to each other or placebo (a medicine that looks like the real medicine but that has no active ingredient).
We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our trust in these results, based on factors such as study methods and size.
We found 112 studies. We were able to combine and analyse the results from 72 studies, with 15,968 participants aged between 47 and 72 years. Thirty-five studies included patients with paroxysmal AF (AF that terminates spontaneously or with intervention within 7 days of onset), 26 studies of patients with persistent AF (AF that is continuously sustained beyond seven days, including episodes terminated by cardioversion after ? 7 days), and 14 trials included patients with atrial flutter. The remaining included a mix of paroxysmal, persistent AF and atrial flutter.
For patients with paroxysmal AF, electrical cardioversion with biphasic incremental energy, fast-acting drugs like intravenous vernakalant, flecainide, ibutilide and antazoline, and slower-acting and/or oral drugs such as quinidine, propafenone, amiodarone and sotalol are effective at restoring sinus rhythm.
For patients with persistent AF, electrical cardioversion with biphasic energy seems to be the most effective option; bepridil, quinidine and amiodarone tablets may also be effective in selected cases.
For patients with atrial flutter, electrical cardioversion followed by dofetilide are the most effective options.
The risk of death and stroke is very low for patients having cardioversion procedures.
Malignant arrhythmias (torsade de pointes, sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, all of which are associated with high 1-year mortality rate) were observed for dofetilide, ibutilide, sotalol, quinidine and vernakalant, justifying the need for special care and closer monitoring when using these drugs. Duration of hospitalisation data was available in three studies but, as there were variable timings in these studies, we could not combine them to assess their joint effectiveness. These studies suggest that the duration of hospitalisation may be lower with electrical cardioversion.
Heart failure was observed in some patients treated with propafenone, flecainide, sotalol, amiodarone, vernakalant, and placebo, and was not observed in patients receiving electrical cardioversion, suggesting that the latter approach should be the preferred one if concerns exist regarding the occurrence of this outcome.
Phlebitis (i.e. inflammation of the vein caused by using injectable drugs) occurred frequently in patients treated with amiodarone, and dysgeusia (i.e. impairment of the sense of taste) and sneezing occurred frequently in patients receiving vernakalant.
We are sure or moderately sure of the results for the efficacy of treatments available for persistent AF and atrial flutter. We are less sure about the results for some of the treatment options for paroxysmal AF.
Not enough data are available regarding quality of life, and data were limited regarding duration of hospital stay.

67838c00a0e049fdf173f9bd,static_1,Best therapy for people with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who have not been treated without a targetable mutation and moderately impaired performance status,"Most people who are newly diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have advanced disease. For these people, survival is determined by various patient- and tumor-related factors, of which the performance status (PS) is the most important prognostic factor. People with PS 0 or 1 are usually treated with systemic therapies, whereas people with PS 3 or 4 most often receive supportive care. However, treatment for people with PS 2 without a targetable mutation remains unclear. Historically, people with a PS 2 cancer are frequently excluded from (important) clinical trials because of poorer outcomes and increased toxicity. We aim to address this knowledge gap, as this group of people represents a significant proportion (20% to 30%) of the total population with newly diagnosed lung cancer.
To identify the best first-line therapy for advanced lung cancer in people with performance status 2 without a targetable mutation or with an unknown mutation status.
We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. 
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared different chemotherapy (with or without angiogenesis inhibitor) or immunotherapy regimens, specifically designed for people with PS 2 only or studies including a subgroup of these people.
We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. overall survival (OS), 2. health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and 3. toxicity/adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were 4. tumor response rate, 5. progression-free survival, and 6. survival rates at six and 12 months' treatment. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence for each outcome.
We included 22 trials in this review and identified one ongoing trial. Twenty studies compared chemotherapy with different regimens, of which 11 compared non-platinum therapy (monotherapy or doublet) versus platinum doublet. We found no studies comparing best supportive care with chemotherapy and only two abstracts analyzing chemotherapy versus immunotherapy. We found that platinum doublet therapy showed superior OS compared to non-platinum therapy (hazard ratio [HR] 0.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.57 to 0.78; 7 trials, 697 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There were no differences in six-month survival rates (risk ratio [RR] 1.00, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.41; 6 trials, 632 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), whereas 12-month survival rates were improved for treatment with platinum doublet therapy (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.87 to 0.97; 11 trials, 1567 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). PFS and tumor response rate were also better for people treated with platinum doublet therapy, with moderate-certainty evidence (PFS: HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.77; 5 trials, 487 participants; tumor response rate: RR 2.25, 95% CI 1.67 to 3.05; 9 trials, 964 participants). When analyzing toxicity rates, we found that platinum doublet therapy increased grade 3 to 5 hematologic toxicities, all with low-certainty evidence (anemia: RR 1.98, 95% CI 1.00 to 3.92; neutropenia: RR 2.75, 95% CI 1.30 to 5.82; thrombocytopenia: RR 3.96, 95% CI 1.73 to 9.06; all 8 trials, 935 participants). Only four trials reported HRQoL data; however, the methodology was different per trial and we were unable to perform a meta-analysis. Although evidence is limited, there were no differences in 12-month survival rates or tumor response rates between carboplatin and cisplatin regimens. With an indirect comparison, carboplatin seemed to have better 12-month survival rates than cisplatin compared to non-platinum therapy. The assessment of the efficacy of immunotherapy in people with PS 2 was limited. There might be a place for single-agent immunotherapy, but the data provided by the included studies did not encourage the use of double-agent immunotherapy.
This review showed that as a first-line treatment for people with PS 2 with advanced NSCLC, platinum doublet therapy seems to be preferred over non-platinum therapy, with a higher response rate, PFS, and OS. Although the risk for grade 3 to 5 hematologic toxicity is higher, these events are often relatively mild and easy to treat. Since trials using checkpoint inhibitors in people with PS 2 are scarce, we identified an important knowledge gap regarding their role in people with advanced NSCLC and PS 2.","Lung cancer is the most frequent cause of cancer-related death worldwide and NSCLC is the most common subtype. At the time of diagnosis, the disease has already spread in more than half of all cases. In the tumors of a minority of people diagnosed with NSCLC that has spread to other parts of the body specific mutations can be found, which are treated distinct from the majority of people without such mutations.
NSCLC can only be treated with life-prolonging medicines such as chemotherapy (a medicine used to destroy cancer cells) or immunotherapy (a medicine that boosts the person's immune system and helps the body find and destroy cancer cells). Selecting the best treatment depends on the health condition of the person. That condition is determined using a scale from 0 (no symptoms) to 5 (dead). There is no discussion on the treatment of relatively fit people (scoring 0 or 1), as they often tolerate these treatments relatively well. People with a low health condition (scoring 3 or 4) receive only supportive care in most cases. However, although representing 20% to 30% of all people, the best treatment for moderately impaired people (PS 2) is not clear, as they often do not participate in trials.
Our objective was to investigate the best therapy for people with advanced NSCLC without a specific mutation with PS 2.
We searched medical databases for clinical trials comparing treatments for advanced NSCLC with best supportive care or other treatments.
We found 22 trials; 20 compared different types of chemotherapy and two compared chemotherapy versus immunotherapy.
People treated with chemotherapy regimens using two medicines, including a platinum-based medicine, had longer survival than people treated with chemotherapies without a platinum-based medicine. However, these people did have more side effects, especially with a negative influence on the bone marrow (matter found in the center of bones), resulting in a temporary lack of red and white blood cells, and platelets. The few studies that analyzed health-related quality of life all used different methods of measurement. We found no difference in quality of life when we looked at those studies individually. We found two partly published trials studying immunotherapy, which found no survival benefit compared to chemotherapy.
We are moderately confident in our results that chemotherapies with a platinum-based medicine increases survival. We are also moderately confident in the evidence evaluating the time to progression of disease because in all included studies, both investigators and trial participants were fully aware of which treatment the participants received. This might lead to substantial bias. In addition, we have little confidence in the evidence regarding toxicities because the evidence is based on a small number of studies with conflicting outcomes.",1023,non-small cell lung cancer; performance status; targetable mutation; immunotherapy regimens; overall survival; health-related quality of life; progression-free survival; tumor response rate; platinum doublet therapy; hematologic toxicities,What are the underlying motivations for focusing on people with performance status 2 in the study of NSCLC treatments?,How did the study distinguish between the effects of platinum-based chemotherapy versus non-platinum regimens?,Select the items that are animals,Critique the robustness of the studyÃ¢ÂÂs conclusions regarding immunotherapy for PS 2 patients.,What is the primary aim of the study discussed in the plain-language summary?,"They often tolerate treatment well, similar to those with PS 0 or 1.; They represent a significant but often neglected portion of NSCLC cases.; They are frequently included in clinical trials, which simplifies research.",They represent a significant but often neglected portion of NSCLC cases.,It demonstrated improved survival outcomes with platinum-based regimens.; It showed no difference in tumor response rates.; It highlighted consistent quality of life improvements with non-platinum regimens.,It demonstrated improved survival outcomes with platinum-based regimens.,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,The study robustly proves the superiority of immunotherapy over chemotherapy.; The evidence for the efficacy of immunotherapy was limited.; The study found clear benefits of double-agent immunotherapy.,The evidence for the efficacy of immunotherapy was limited.,To find the best therapy for people with PS 2 in advanced NSCLC without a specific mutation; To develop a new platinum-based chemotherapy drug; To compare supportive care with chemotherapy,To find the best therapy for people with PS 2 in advanced NSCLC without a specific mutation
67838c00a0e049fdf173f9bd,static_2,Renin angiotensin system inhibitors versus other types of medicine for hypertension,"This is the first update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2015. Renin angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors include angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and renin inhibitors. They are widely prescribed for treatment of hypertension, especially for people with diabetes because of postulated advantages for reducing diabetic nephropathy and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Despite widespread use for hypertension, the efficacy and safety of RAS inhibitors compared to other antihypertensive drug classes remains unclear. To evaluate the benefits and harms of first-line RAS inhibitors compared to other first-line antihypertensive drugs in people with hypertension. The Cochrane Hypertension Group Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to November 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. The searches had no language restrictions. We included randomized, active-controlled, double-blinded studies (RCTs) with at least six months follow-up in people with elevated blood pressure (? 130/85 mmHg), which compared first-line RAS inhibitors with other first-line antihypertensive drug classes and reported morbidity and mortality or blood pressure outcomes. We excluded people with proven secondary hypertension. Two authors independently selected the included trials, evaluated the risks of bias and entered the data for analysis. This update includes three new RCTs, totaling 45 in all, involving 66,625 participants, with a mean age of 66 years. Much of the evidence for our key outcomes is dominated by a small number of large RCTs at low risk for most sources of bias. Imbalances in the added second-line antihypertensive drugs in some of the studies were important enough for us to downgrade the quality of the evidence. Primary outcomes were all-cause death, fatal and non-fatal stroke, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), fatal and non-fatal congestive heart failure (CHF) requiring hospitalizations, total cardiovascular (CV) events (fatal and non-fatal stroke, fatal and non-fatal MI and fatal and non-fatal CHF requiring hospitalization), and end-stage renal failure (ESRF). Secondary outcomes were systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR). Compared with first-line calcium channel blockers (CCBs), we found moderate-certainty evidence that first-line RAS inhibitors decreased heart failure (HF) (35,143 participants in 5 RCTs, risk ratio (RR) 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77 to 0.90, absolute risk reduction (ARR) 1.2%), and that they increased stroke (34,673 participants in 4 RCTs, RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.32, absolute risk increase (ARI) 0.7%). Moderate-certainty evidence showed that first-line RAS inhibitors and first-line CCBs did not differ for all-cause death (35,226 participants in 5 RCTs, RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.09); total CV events (35,223 participants in 6 RCTs, RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.02); and total MI (35,043 participants in 5 RCTs, RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.09). Low-certainty evidence suggests they did not differ for ESRF (19,551 participants in 4 RCTs, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.05). Compared with first-line thiazides, we found moderate-certainty evidence that first-line RAS inhibitors increased HF (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.31, ARI 1.0%), and increased stroke (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.28, ARI 0.6%). Moderate-certainty evidence showed that first-line RAS inhibitors and first-line thiazides did not differ for all-cause death (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.07); total CV events (24,379 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 1.05, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.11); and total MI (24,379 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.01). Low-certainty evidence suggests they did not differ for ESRF (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.37). Compared with first-line beta-blockers, low-certainty evidence suggests that first-line RAS inhibitors decreased total CV events (9239 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.98, ARR 1.7%), and decreased stroke (9193 participants in 1 RCT, RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.88, ARR 1.7%). Low-certainty evidence suggests that first-line RAS inhibitors and first-line beta-blockers did not differ for all-cause death (9193 participants in 1 RCT, RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.01); HF (9193 participants in 1 RCT, RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.18); and total MI (9239 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.27). Blood pressure comparisons between first-line RAS inhibitors and other first-line classes showed either no differences or small differences that did not necessarily correlate with the differences in the morbidity outcomes. There is no information about non-fatal serious adverse events, as none of the trials reported this outcome. All-cause death is similar for first-line RAS inhibitors and first-line CCBs, thiazides and beta-blockers. There are, however, differences for some morbidity outcomes. First-line thiazides caused less HF and stroke than first-line RAS inhibitors. First-line CCBs increased HF but decreased stroke compared to first-line RAS inhibitors. The magnitude of the increase in HF exceeded the decrease in stroke. Low-quality evidence suggests that first-line RAS inhibitors reduced stroke and total CV events compared to first-line beta-blockers. The small differences in effect on blood pressure between the different classes of drugs did not correlate with the differences in the morbidity outcomes.","We determined how RAS (renin angiotensin system) inhibitors compared as first-line medicines for treating hypertension with other types of first-line medicines (thiazide diuretics, beta-blockers, CCBs, alpha-blockers, or central nervous system (CNS) active drugs) for hypertension. Hypertension is a long-lasting medical condition and associated with cardiovascular mortality and morbidity such as coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral vascular disease, which will reduce quality of life. RAS inhibitors have become a focus of interventions for hypertension in recent years and have been widely prescribed for treatment of hypertension. However, it remains unclear whether RAS inhibitors are superior to other antihypertensive drugs in terms of clinically relevant outcomes.
We searched for evidence up to November 2017. We included randomized, double-blind, parallel design RCTs for the present review. 45 trials with 66,625 participants who were followed-up for between 0.5 year and 5.6 years were included. The participants had an average age of 66 years. Overall, certainty of evidence was assessed as low to moderate according to the GRADE assessment. Moderate-certainty evidence demonstrated superiority of first-line thiazides to first-line RAS inhibitors in preventing heart failure and stroke. The certainty of evidence was assessed moderate for comparison between RAS inhibitors and CCBs. The certainty of evidence was low for comparison between RAS inhibitors and beta-blockers on total cardiovascular events and stroke since the results were based primarily on one large trial with moderate to high risk of bias.",1066,Renin angiotensin system inhibitors; diabetic nephropathy; cardiovascular morbidity; mortality; calcium channel blockers; heart failure; myocardial infarction; end-stage renal failure; thiazides; beta-blockers,What was the main focus of the Cochrane Review on RAS inhibitors?,Why are RAS inhibitors widely prescribed for people with hypertension?,Select all of the following that are fruits,"According to the review, how do thiazides compare to RAS inhibitors?",How is the overall quality of evidence described in the review?,To evaluate RAS inhibitors compared to other first-line antihypertensive drugs.; To study the cost-effectiveness of RAS inhibitors.; To compare the side effects of different antihypertensive drugs.,To evaluate RAS inhibitors compared to other first-line antihypertensive drugs.,They are believed to reduce diabetic nephropathy and cardiovascular issues.; They are the cheapest option available.; They have the fewest side effects.,They are believed to reduce diabetic nephropathy and cardiovascular issues.,dog; blue; grape,grape,Thiazides are superior in preventing heart failure and stroke.; Thiazides result in more side effects.; Thiazides are less effective in reducing blood pressure.,Thiazides are superior in preventing heart failure and stroke.,The overall quality of evidence is low to moderate.; The overall quality of evidence is high.; The overall quality of evidence is very low.,The overall quality of evidence is low to moderate.
67838c00a0e049fdf173f9bd,static_2,Treatment options for people with recurrent and progressive glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly malignant brain tumour that almost always progresses or recurs after standard first-line treatment, and there is no consensus on the most effective therapy once the disease returns. This review evaluated available treatments for first and later recurrence in people previously treated with the standard Stupp protocol and included a brief economic commentary. Searches of major medical databases up to December 2019 identified 42 eligible studies (34 randomised trials and 8 non-randomised studies) involving 5236 participants. Most randomised trials had low risk of bias, while non-randomised studies had high risk of bias. Treatments included chemotherapy, re-operation, re-irradiation, and novel therapies used alone or in combination. For first recurrence, 11 treatments contributed to the overall survival network analysis and eight to the progression-free survival analysis, with lomustine (LOM/CCNU) used as the reference treatment. No included studies in the network meta-analysis evaluated surgery, re-irradiation, PCV, temozolomide (TMZ) rechallenge, or best supportive care, and quality-of-life data were sparse. Median overall survival ranged from 5.5 to 12.6 months and median progression-free survival from 1.5 to 4.2 months. No high-certainty evidence showed any treatment improved survival compared with lomustine. Bevacizumab plus lomustine probably resulted in little or no difference in survival compared with lomustine alone, though it may improve progression-free survival. Bevacizumab alone may offer little or no survival benefit, and evidence remains uncertain. Regorafenib may improve overall survival compared with lomustine but evidence certainty was low. Temozolomide plus Depatux-M (ABT414) may improve survival compared with lomustine or bevacizumab, possibly driven by the temozolomide component, but additional evidence is needed. Fotemustine may have similar effects to lomustine. Evidence for bevacizumab plus irinotecan was very uncertain, and it likely offers little benefit over bevacizumab alone. Ranking analyses placed fotemustine first, followed by bevacizumab plus lomustine, lomustine alone, bevacizumab plus irinotecan, and bevacizumab alone, though ranking does not reflect evidence certainty. Three studies examining re-operation suggested it may extend survival in carefully selected patients. One early-phase study suggested a potential role for a cannabinoid plus temozolomide. Evidence for treatment of second or later recurrence was limited; some heterogeneous studies suggested radiotherapy with or without bevacizumab may improve survival, while tumour-treating fields showed little difference compared with physician's choice. No reliable evidence was found for best supportive care. Severe adverse events were significantly more common with bevacizumab plus lomustine than with lomustine alone and were similarly high with cediranib plus lomustine. Lomustine alone had the lowest rate of severe adverse events, followed by regorafenib. Combinations that added novel agents to bevacizumab generally increased toxicity. Overall, combination treatments for first recurrence did not improve survival compared with lomustine monotherapy and were often associated with more severe adverse events. Re-operation and re-irradiation may benefit selected individuals. Evidence for later recurrences remains sparse, and more high-quality research is needed.","Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a very aggressive brain tumour that often continues to grow even after surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, and almost always comes back. Many different treatments have been tested for tumour progression or recurrence, but there is no agreement on which option is best. This review evaluated treatments for people whose GBM progressed or recurred after receiving standard initial care. A total of 42 studies involving 5236 people were included. Treatments examined included chemotherapy, re-operation, re-irradiation, and newer therapies used alone or in combination. For first recurrence, none of the treatments showed clear evidence of being better than lomustine (CCNU). Adding bevacizumab to lomustine did not improve overall survival, and most other agents either had uncertain benefits or did not improve outcomes. Several commonly used treatments such as PCV and temozolomide re-challenge were not represented in the available evidence. Limited evidence suggested that a second surgery, with or without additional therapies, may offer some survival benefit in selected individuals. For second or later recurrence, evidence was too limited for statistical analysis, but radiotherapy with or without bevacizumab might offer some benefit, though this is uncertain. Serious side effects occurred with many treatments, and combining bevacizumab with lomustine resulted in more severe adverse events than lomustine alone. Overall, lomustine appears to be the most effective chemotherapy option for first recurrence, and other combination therapies generally carried higher risks without clear benefits. A second surgery or radiotherapy may be helpful for some individuals. For later recurrences, evidence is sparse and uncertain.

67838c00a0e049fdf173f9bd,interactive_3,"Thymic peptides for treatment of cancer patients in addition to chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or both","Purified thymus extracts (pTE) and synthetic thymic peptides (sTP) are thought to enhance the immune system of cancer patients to help fight tumour growth and reduce infections caused by disease-related or treatment-related immunosuppression. This review evaluated the effectiveness of pTE and sTP for cancer management. Researchers searched major medical databases up to February 2010 for randomized trials in adult cancer patients where pTE or sTP were added to chemotherapy or radiotherapy and compared with the same regimen alone or with placebo. Data were independently extracted by two authors, and odds ratios were calculated for overall survival, disease-free survival, tumour response, and adverse effects. A random-effects model was used. Twenty-six trials involving 2736 patients were identified: 20 trials investigated pTE (thymostimulin or thymosin fraction 5) and six investigated sTP (thymopentin or thymosin ?1). Twenty-one trials reported overall survival, six reported disease-free survival, 14 reported tumour response, nine reported adverse effects, and 10 reported safety. Adding pTE showed no benefit for overall survival (RR 1.00), disease-free survival (RR 0.97), or tumour response (RR 1.07), with moderate to high heterogeneity. For thymosin ?1, the pooled RR for overall survival was 1.21 and for disease-free survival was 3.37, though neither result reached statistical significance. pTE reduced the risk of severe infectious complications (RR 0.54), and thymostimulin showed a non-significant trend toward reduced severe neutropenia. Both pTE and sTP were generally well tolerated. Many trials had at least moderate risk of bias. Overall, there is no clear evidence that adding pTE to cancer treatment improves survival or tumour response, although thymosin ?1 showed a possible trend toward benefit. There is preliminary evidence that pTE may reduce severe infectious complications during chemotherapy or radiotherapy.","The immune system plays a key role in the body's own defences against cancer cells. The thymus gland plays a central part in this and modifies T-cells, a subset of lymphocytes. Studies with thymic peptides have shown a variety of effects on the immune system. There are two groups of thymic peptides available for use in treatment: purified extracts from animal (mostly calf) thymus glands and synthetically produced thymus gland peptides.
This review aims to answer the question whether having thymic peptides can improve the response to and tolerability of standard chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or combined treatment. Further questions are whether the peptides inhibit or reduce the progression and recurrence of disease, whether they prolong the life of cancer patients and whether quality of life is improved. This review looked at the evidence from 26 clinical trials with a total of 2736 adult cancer patients. Many of the trials were small and of moderate quality. Only three studies were less than 10 years old. Thymosin ?1 is a synthetic peptide that shows some promise as a treatment option for patients with metastatic melanoma when used in addition to chemotherapy. Severe problems occur during chemotherapy and radiotherapy due to low white blood cell counts and infections. These were reduced by using purified thymus extracts.

67838c00a0e049fdf173f9bd,interactive_4,Is favipiravir useful in treating people with COVID-19?,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to challenge the health workforce and societies worldwide. Favipiravir was suggested by some experts to be effective and safe to use in COVID-19. Although this drug has been evaluated in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), it is still unclear if it has a definite role in the treatment of COVID-19. The aim of this Cochrane Review was to assess the effects of favipiravir compared to no treatment, supportive treatment, or other experimental antiviral treatment in people with acute COVID-19. Researchers searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, MEDLINE, Embase, the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease, and three other databases up to 18 July 2023 for RCTs evaluating the efficacy of favipiravir in treating people with COVID-19. Using standard Cochrane methodological procedures and the GRADE approach, they included 25 trials that randomized 5750 adults (most under 60 years of age) across multiple countries, with most participants hospitalized with mild to moderate disease (89%). Twenty-two trials compared favipiravir to placebo or standard of care, two used lopinavir/ritonavir, and one used umifenovir; most regimens began with 1600 mg or 1800 mg twice daily on day one, followed by 600 mg to 800 mg twice daily for five to 14 days. The evidence remains very uncertain regarding whether favipiravir reduces all-cause mortality at 28 to 30 days or in-hospital (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.46; 11 trials, 3459 participants), or whether it reduces progression to invasive mechanical ventilation (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.09; 8 trials, 1383 participants). Favipiravir may make little to no difference in the need for hospital admission among ambulatory patients (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.46; 4 trials, 670 participants), and the evidence is very uncertain regarding time to clinical improvement (HR 1.13, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.83; 4 trials, 721 participants). It may also make little to no difference in progression to oxygen therapy (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.75; 2 trials, 543 participants). Favipiravir may lead to an increased incidence of adverse events overall (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.54; 18 trials, 4699 participants), but may result in little to no difference in serious adverse events attributable to the drug (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.42; 12 trials, 3317 participants). Overall, low- to very low-certainty evidence means that it is not known whether favipiravir is efficacious in people with COVID-19 illness of any severity or admission status, and while treatment may increase general adverse events, it may not increase serious adverse events.","What is favipiravir? Favipiravir is a medicine that can fight viruses. It is usually taken by mouth. Originally used for treating other viral infections, favipiravir has been suggested as a potential treatment for COVID-19 as it prevents the reproduction of the virus. Medical regulators have approved favipiravir for emergency use to treat people with COVID-19. What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out if favipiravir was better than no treatment, supportive treatment, or any other experimental antiviral treatment for people with COVID-19, in terms of death, need for a breathing machine (mechanical ventilation), and other outcomes. We also wanted to find out if favipiravir was associated with any unwanted effects. What did we do? We searched for studies that compared favipiravir with no treatment, supportive treatment, or other antiviral treatment in people with COVID-19 disease. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. What did we find? We found 25 relevant studies involving 5750 people. The studies were conducted in 13 different countries: Bahrain, Brazil, China, India, Iran, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, the UK, and the USA. Most people were under 60 years old and had mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms. What are the main results of our review?  We do not know if favipiravir reduces the number of people who die from COVID-19 when compared to dummy treatment, standard of care, or other antiviral medicines. The evidence supporting this is not very strong (derived from 11 studies involving 3459 people). It is also very unclear if favipiravir reduces the need for people to be put on ventilators compared to a dummy treatment or any other antiviral treatments (derived from 8 studies involving 1383 people). In people with mild symptoms, using favipiravir may not reduce the likelihood of needing hospitalization, but more research is needed to be sure (derived from 4 studies involving 670 people). Favipiravir has an unclear effect on the time it takes for people to improve, as defined by a reduction in their illness severity (derived from 4 studies involving 721 people).  Favipiravir seems to make very little difference in reducing the need for treatment with oxygen, compared to a dummy treatment or other antiviral treatment (derived from 2 studies involving 543 people). Favipiravir might lead to mild side effects (derived from 18 studies involving 4699 people) but doesn't seem to cause major or severe side effects (derived from 12 studies involving 3317 people). What are the limitations of the evidence? Our confidence in the evidence for using favipiravir is limited because people in the studies had different disease severities and the studies were of varying sizes and had inconsistent results.",1107,COVID-19 pandemic; SARS-CoV-2; favipiravir; all-cause mortality; invasive mechanical ventilation; ambulatory patients; oxygen therapy; adverse events; serious adverse events; lopinavir/ritonavir,"In evaluating the study outcomes, how should the inconsistent results influence future clinical guidelines regarding favipiravir?",Which methodological approaches from this review could be enhanced to better support favipiravir efficacy conclusions in future studies?,Select all of the following that are fruits,"Based on the plain-language summary, how could the clarity of favipiravir's effects on mechanical ventilation be improved?",Which outcome did the research hope to clarify regarding favipiravir's effect?,Inconsistent results suggest caution in widespread use without further research.; Inconsistencies indicate immediate adoption into treatment protocols.; They show consistent efficacy across all outcomes.,Inconsistent results suggest caution in widespread use without further research.,Only include studies with the most positive outcomes.; Increase uniformity in disease severity among participants.; Focus exclusively on small-scale trials to ensure manageability.,Increase uniformity in disease severity among participants.,dog; blue; grape,grape,By increasing the number of studies focusing on severe cases.; By completely excluding severe cases from trials.; By reducing the number of studies included in the analysis.,By increasing the number of studies focusing on severe cases.,Need for mechanical ventilation; Cure for COVID-19; Prevention of new infections,Need for mechanical ventilation
67838c00a0e049fdf173f9bd,interactive_4,Does yoga relieve cancer-related fatigue in people with cancer?,"Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is one of the most prevalent symptoms in individuals with cancer. Various types of exercise have shown beneficial effects. While previous systematic reviews suggest exercise may improve CRF and quality of life, evidence specifically about yoga's impact, as well as evidence on long-term effects, is limited. Previous syntheses offer promising but inconclusive findings on yoga's effectiveness. This review is one of a suite of five reviews exploring exercise for cancer-related fatigue.
To assess the effects of yoga versus no yoga on cancer-related fatigue in people with cancer: before, during, and after anticancer treatment; in the short, medium, and long term; and effects on quality of life (QoL), adverse events, depression, and anxiety.
We used CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, five other databases and two trials registers, together with reference checking, citation searching and contact with study authors to identify studies that are included in the review. The latest search date was October 2023.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing yoga to no yoga. We included studies in adults (aged 18 and older) with any type of cancer and anticancer therapy who received yoga before, during, or after anticancer therapy. We included trials evaluating at least one of the main outcomes (CRF or QoL). Yoga had to last for at least five sessions, and involve face-to-face instruction. We excluded trials with fewer than 20 participants randomised per group.
The outcomes of interest in this review are cancer-related fatigue (CRF), quality of life (QoL), adverse events, depression, and anxiety. We used standard methods expected by Cochrane. For analyses, we pooled results within the same period of outcome assessment (i.e. short, medium, and long term), and employed a random-effects model. We assessed risk of bias with the Cochrane risk of bias (RoB) 1 tool, and used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence.
We included 21 RCTs with 2041 people with cancer who received yoga during (13 studies) or after (eight studies) anticancer therapy; none examined yoga initiated before therapy. Here we present results on CRF and QoL; findings on adverse events, depression, and anxiety are in the full review. Yoga during anticancer therapy The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of yoga compared to no yoga on: short-term CRF (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.18 to 0.32; mean difference (MD) on Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI; lower values mean better outcome) of 0.16, 95% CI -0.41 to 0.71; 3 studies, 253 participants); medium-term CRF (MD on Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI; lower values mean better outcome) of -1.30, 95% CI -3.50 to 0.90; 1 study, 67 participants); and long-term CRF (MD 0.09 on BFI, 95% CI 1.16 to 0.98; 2 studies, 155 participants) (all very low-certainty evidence). Yoga may have a small beneficial effect or no effect compared to no yoga on short-term QoL (SMD 0.25, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.45; MD on Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30 (QLQ-C30; higher values mean better outcome) of 5.28, 95% CI 0.84 to 9.56; 4 studies, 374 participants) and medium-term QoL (MD on QLQ-C30 of 7.63, 95% CI 6.71 to 21.97; 2 studies, 151 participants), but the evidence is very uncertain (all very low-certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported long-term QoL. Yoga after anticancer therapy Yoga probably has a beneficial effect compared to no yoga on short-term CRF (SMD -0.26, 95% CI -0.42 to -0.09; MD 2.55, 95% CI 0.88 to 4.12; higher values mean better outcome; 5 studies, 602 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Yoga might have a beneficial effect or no effect compared to no yoga on medium-term CRF, but the evidence is very uncertain (MD 3.02, 95% CI -1.48 to 7.52; 1 study, 54 participants (higher values mean better outcome; very low-certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported long-term CRF. Yoga may have a small beneficial effect or no effect compared to no yoga on short-term QoL (SMD 0.19, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.47; MD -3.27, 95% CI -8.08 to 1.55; higher values mean better outcome; 4 studies, 275 participants) and medium term QoL (MD 7.06, 95% CI -1.38 to 15.50; 1 study, 54 participants; higher values mean better outcome), but the evidence is very uncertain (all very low-certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported long-term QoL. A key limitation of the review was the included studies' methodological constraints: participants' awareness of treatment assignments (yoga or control) potentially introduced bias. Additionally, sample sizes were too small to determine medium- and long-term effects conclusively. Further research is needed to evaluate the sustainability of yoga's impact on cancer-related fatigue, quality of life, and adverse events.
Our review provides uncertain evidence of the beneficial effects of yoga initiated during or after anticancer therapy compared to no yoga for people with cancer. Although there are indications supporting the use of yoga to address CRF, the uncertainty of the evidence underscores the need for caution in its implementation. Future RCTs should employ rigorous methodologies, enroll sufficient participants, and use appropriate controls.","Cancer-related fatigue is a feeling of extreme tiredness that lasts for a long time. It can be caused by cancer, cancer therapy, or both. Cancer-related fatigue affects the body and mood and makes it hard to perform regular activities. It is stronger than just being tired and does not go away by resting. Clinical guidelines recommend physical exercise to improve cancer-related fatigue. Physical exercise affects cancer-related fatigue by influencing biological and psychological processes, but it is unclear what types of exercise may be most beneficial. Yoga may reduce cancer-related fatigue and improve quality of life because it combines physical movement with breath control, mental focus, and body awareness. This review explored whether yoga improves cancer-related fatigue and quality of life in adults. We also examined whether any adverse events occurred in the studies. We investigated short-term (up to 12 weeks), medium-term (12 weeks to 6 months), and long-term (more than 6 months) effects. We searched for studies comparing yoga with no yoga in adults with any cancer, including yoga done before, during, or after anticancer therapy. Multiple types of yoga were included, such as Hatha and Dru yoga. We compared and summarised the results, assessed study quality, and considered differences based on type of yoga, cancer type, format of exercise (group vs individual; supervised vs unsupervised), and participant age. We found 21 studies involving 2041 participants with various cancers, mostly women with breast cancer. Yoga was initiated during anticancer therapy in 13 studies and after therapy in eight studies; no studies examined yoga before treatment. It is unclear whether yoga during anticancer therapy improves short, medium, or long-term cancer-related fatigue. Yoga during therapy may increase short- and medium-term quality of life, but the evidence is very uncertain, and no studies measured long-term quality of life. Only one study reported adverse events, so it is unclear whether yoga affects safety outcomes. No meaningful differences were found between different yoga types, training formats, supervision levels, or cancer types. Yoga after anticancer therapy probably reduces short-term cancer-related fatigue, but its effects on medium-term fatigue are unclear, and long-term fatigue was not measured. Yoga after therapy may slightly increase short and medium-term quality of life, but evidence is very uncertain, and long-term outcomes were not assessed. It is also unclear whether yoga after therapy leads to adverse events, and no differences were found between yoga types, cancer types, or age groups. Limitations include lack of blinding, which may influence results, and small or insufficiently long studies for several outcomes.

67838c00a0e049fdf173f9bd,finetuned_5,Do dietary and activity strategies help prevent obesity in children aged 2 to 4 years?,"To assess the effects of interventions that aimed to prevent obesity in children aged two to four years by changing dietary intake or activity levels, or both, on body mass index (BMI), BMI z-score (zBMI), BMI percentile, and serious adverse events. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, six other databases, and two trial registers, together with reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors to identify eligible studies. The latest search date was 7 February 2023. In early childhood, combined dietary/activity interventions may have very modest benefits on BMI and zBMI at long-term follow-up. When implemented alone, dietary or activity interventions may have little to no effect on BMI measures. Only six studies reported serious adverse events, with no serious harms resulting directly from the intervention, but the evidence is very uncertain.","There is an increasing number of young children living with overweight and obesity worldwide, with evidence of the rates increasing in line with social inequality. Living with overweight during childhood can cause physical and psychological health problems. Children living with overweight are more likely to live with overweight as adults, and continue to experience poor physical and mental health. We wanted to find out if strategies to help people change diet or activity (or both) are effective at preventing obesity in children aged 2 to 4 years, and whether they are associated with any serious adverse events. To examine obesity, we used the measure of body mass index (BMI). BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by their height (in m2). We searched for studies that looked at ways to prevent obesity in children aged 2 to 4 years. We did not include studies that only targeted children who were already living with overweight or obesity, but we did include studies involving children at a range of weights. We only included studies if they used methods aimed at changing children's diet, activity level (increasing physical activity or reducing sedentary behaviour), or both. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We grouped studies together for analysis depending on whether they aimed to improve diet, activity, or both. We found 67 studies involving 36,601 children aged 2 to 4 years. Most studies (63 of 67) were based in high-income countries, and four in upper-middle-income countries. In 26 studies, the strategies were conducted in childcare settings, 23 studies were primarily home-based, and 10 were performed in both childcare and home-based settings. Only 3 studies were conducted in the community, and 5 in healthcare settings. The duration of the programmes varied: 47 ran for fewer than 9 months, with the shortest being 1 visit and the longest lasting 3 years. We analysed results from 56 studies involving 21,404 children. Children who were helped with a strategy to change their diet and activity levels may have had a reduced BMI, compared with children not given any strategy. This means that these children may have been able to minimise excess weight gain by a small amount, which, for public health, is important. Children who were helped with a strategy to change their diet or activity alone did not have a reduced BMI. Only six of the 67 included studies reported on serious adverse events, and no serious harms were identified. Overall, our confidence in the evidence is very low. However, we do not believe that results from more studies similar in design to those included in this review would produce a higher level of confidence in the results. Four main factors reduced our confidence in the evidence. Results were very inconsistent across different studies. There were not enough studies reporting specific types of outcomes for a particular duration of follow-up to be certain about the results for some comparisons. Results from some studies were not reported in a way that we could include in our analyses and this may have had an impact on the combined results. Studies generally had limitations in how they were conducted, due to the complexity of studies in this age group. This review does not provide enough information to assess how well these strategies work for children with disabilities or those from low- and middle-income countries.",1102,interventions; dietary intake; activity levels; body mass index; BMI z-score; BMI percentile; serious adverse events; long-term follow-up; dietary/activity interventions; serious harms,What changes would improve the overall confidence in the evidence provided by the studies reviewed?,What criteria were used to include studies in the review?,Select the items that are animals,Describe the impact of combined dietary and activity interventions on BMI.,Explain the significance of implementing strategies that involve both diet and activity for public health.,More consistent data reporting; Broader geographic diversity of study locations; Stronger adverse event monitoring,More consistent data reporting; Broader geographic diversity of study locations,Strategies aimed at changing children's diet or activity; Targeting children already living with obesity; Involvement of children across a range of weights,Strategies aimed at changing children's diet or activity; Involvement of children across a range of weights,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,They may slightly reduce BMI.; They have no effect on BMI.; They significantly reduce BMI.,They may slightly reduce BMI.,They help minimize excess weight gain.; They eliminate obesity completely.; They have no relevance to public health.,They help minimize excess weight gain.
67838c00a0e049fdf173f9bd,finetuned_6,Biosimilar monoclonal antibodies for cancer treatment in adults,"Biosimilars are products that contain an approved biological medicine and are similar, but not identical, to the original version (the originator). In cancer, biosimilars have been developed from the monoclonal antibodies bevacizumab, rituximab, and trastuzumab, and they are now available for treating lung, colorectal, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and breast cancers. Because biological products cannot be made identically, it is important to evaluate the clinical effects of biosimilars compared with their originators to understand their benefits and harms. We evaluated the benefits and harms of biosimilar monoclonal antibodies versus their originators in adults with cancer. We searched major medical and clinical trial databases up to February 2024 for randomized controlled trials comparing biosimilars to originators. Standard Cochrane methods were used. The primary outcomes were progression-free survival, duration of response, overall survival, pathological complete response in breast cancer, serious adverse events, and health-related quality of life. We included 55 studies with 22,046 adults: 23 studies of bevacizumab involving 10,639 participants with colorectal or lung cancer, 17 studies of rituximab involving 4412 participants with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 15 studies of trastuzumab involving 6995 participants with breast cancer. Studies took place worldwide, were mostly multicentre, and all were funded by manufacturers. Participants ranged in age from 47 to 62 years, and the percentage of women ranged from 18% to 100%. Fifteen studies used non-inferiority designs and 40 used equivalence designs. Overall risk of bias was low, with most concerns related to incomplete outcome data and selective reporting. For bevacizumab in lung or colorectal cancer, progression-free survival was likely similar between biosimilars and originators, with equal numbers per 1000 at 12 months and a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.00. Duration of response and overall survival were also likely similar, and serious adverse events showed no important differences. Health-related quality of life was evaluated in only one colorectal cancer study and results were similar. Objective response and mortality were likely similar as well. For rituximab in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, biosimilars were likely similar to originators for progression-free survival, duration of response, overall survival, serious adverse events, objective response, and mortality. No studies reported quality of life. For trastuzumab in breast cancer, biosimilars were likely similar to originators for progression-free survival, duration of response, overall survival, serious adverse events, and objective response, and may be similar for pathological complete response. No studies reported quality of life. Across bevacizumab, rituximab, and trastuzumab, biosimilars were generally similar to their originators in progression-free survival, duration of response, overall survival, serious adverse events, objective response, and mortality. Evidence for pathological complete response (trastuzumab) and quality of life (bevacizumab) was limited. Overall, evidence certainty was moderate, with imprecision being the main reason for downgrading confidence.","Biological medicines used in cancer treatment are made from living organisms and work by killing cancer cells. Biosimilars are medicines that are similar to the original biological medicine, known as the originator. Although biosimilars have slightly different structures, they target cancer cells in the same way. Originator medicines, sometimes called reference or innovator medicines, receive approval before biosimilars. Unlike generic medicines, which are chemically derived and easier to replicate, originators and biosimilars are biological medicines, making it more difficult to create identical copies. However, biosimilars are often cheaper and could improve access to effective cancer treatment if they provide similar benefits and harms. We wanted to compare the benefits and harms of bevacizumab, rituximab, and trastuzumab biosimilars with their originators. Based on the input from five people with cancer, we considered several outcomes critical for clinical decisions: the length of time cancer does not grow or spread after treatment, the length of time people remain cancer-free, overall survival, the number of people whose breast cancer disappears in tissue removed during surgery, severe unwanted effects, and well-being. We also identified outcomes important for decision-making: the number of people whose cancer shrinks or disappears, death, and the time until cancer grows or spreads or until death. We searched for studies comparing biosimilars of bevacizumab, rituximab, or trastuzumab with the originators in people with lung, colorectal, non-Hodkin's lymphoma, and breast cancers, summarized the results, and rated our confidence in the evidence. We found 55 studies with 22,046 participants, including 10,639 receiving bevacizumab for advanced or metastatic lung cancer, 4412 receiving rituximab mainly for non-Hodkin's lymphoma, and 6995 receiving trastuzumab for advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Participants were 47 to 62 years old on average, and the studies took place across Asia, Europe, and North and South America. All studies were funded by the companies manufacturing the biosimilars. Receiving biosimilars or originator medicines led to similar results overall, and we are moderately confident that biosimilars are as effective as the originators in treating cancer. We set narrow criteria to judge whether results were sufficiently similar, and while most comparisons did not fall fully within this range, overall findings still support similarity. Most studies were well conducted, but a few may have allowed participants to know which treatment they received, and some studies did not report all outcomes of interest.",1018,biosilimars; biological medicine; bevacizumab; rituximab; trastuzumab; progression-free survival; duration of response; overall survival; serious adverse events; health-related quality of life,In what way do biosimilars demonstrate their therapeutic value compared to originators?,How could a decision-maker justify the use of biosimilars in cancer treatment?,Select all of the following that are colors,Name the three monoclonal antibodies mentioned that have biosimilars.,Describe the types of cancer involved in the studies comparing biosimilars and originators.,By showing adequately similar outcomes in critical measures for decision-making.; By providing completely different benefits that improve treatment options.; By achieving perfect replication of all outcomes observed with originators.,By showing adequately similar outcomes in critical measures for decision-making.,By arguing that biosimilars provide a moderate increase in life expectancy.; By highlighting their overall similar effectiveness and lower cost.; By pointing to their identical molecular composition to originators.,By highlighting their overall similar effectiveness and lower cost.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Bevacizumab; Rituximab; Trastuzumab,Bevacizumab; Rituximab; Trastuzumab,"Lung, colorectal, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and breast cancers.; Prostate and skin cancers.; Bone and stomach cancers.","Lung, colorectal, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and breast cancers."
67838c00a0e049fdf173f9bd,finetuned_6,Clopidogrel plus aspirin versus aspirin alone for preventing cardiovascular events,"Aspirin is the prophylactic antiplatelet drug of choice for people with cardiovascular disease. Adding a second antiplatelet drug to aspirin may produce additional benefit for people at high risk and people with established cardiovascular disease. This is an update to a previously published review from 2011.
To review the benefit and harm of adding clopidogrel to aspirin therapy for preventing cardiovascular events in people who have coronary disease, ischaemic cerebrovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, or were at high risk of atherothrombotic disease, but did not have a coronary stent. We updated the searches of CENTRAL (2017, Issue 6), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 4 July 2017) and Embase (Ovid, 1947 to 3 July 2017) on 4 July 2017. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP portal, and handsearched reference lists. We applied no language restrictions. We included all randomised controlled trials comparing over 30 days use of aspirin plus clopidogrel with aspirin plus placebo or aspirin alone in people with coronary disease, ischaemic cerebrovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, or at high risk of atherothrombotic disease. We excluded studies including only people with coronary drug-eluting stent (DES) or non-DES, or both. We collected data on mortality from cardiovascular causes, all-cause mortality, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction, fatal and non-fatal ischaemic stroke, major and minor bleeding. The overall treatment effect was estimated by the pooled risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI), using a fixed-effect model (Mantel-Haenszel); we used a random-effects model in cases of moderate or severe heterogeneity (I2=30%). We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We used GRADE profiler (GRADE Pro) to import data from Review Manager to create a 'Summary of findings' table. The search identified 13 studies in addition to the two studies in the previous version of our systematic review. Overall, we included data from 15 trials with 33,970 people. We completed a 'Risk of bias' assessment for all studies. The risk of bias was low in four trials because they were at low risk of bias for all key domains (random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, selective outcome reporting and incomplete outcome data), even if some of them were funded by the pharmaceutical industry. Analysis showed no difference in the effectiveness of aspirin plus clopidogrel in preventing cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.10; participants = 31,903; studies = 7; moderate quality evidence), and no evidence of a difference in all-cause mortality (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.25; participants = 32,908; studies = 9; low quality evidence). There was a lower risk of fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction with clopidogrel plus aspirin compared with aspirin plus placebo or aspirin alone (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.90; participants = 16,175; studies = 6; moderate quality evidence). There was a reduction in the risk of fatal and non-fatal ischaemic stroke (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.91; participants = 4006; studies = 5; moderate quality evidence). However, there was a higher risk of major bleeding with clopidogrel plus aspirin compared with aspirin plus placebo or aspirin alone (RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.64; participants = 33,300; studies = 10; moderate quality evidence) and of minor bleeding (RR 2.03, 95% CI 1.75 to 2.36; participants = 14,731; studies = 8; moderate quality evidence). Overall, we would expect 13 myocardial infarctions and 23 ischaemic strokes be prevented for every 1000 patients treated with the combination in a median follow-up period of 12 months, but 9 major bleeds and 33 minor bleeds would be caused during a median follow-up period of 10.5 and 6 months, respectively. The available evidence demonstrates that the use of clopidogrel plus aspirin in people at high risk of cardiovascular disease and people with established cardiovascular disease without a coronary stent is associated with a reduction in the risk of myocardial infarction and ischaemic stroke, and an increased risk of major and minor bleeding compared with aspirin alone. According to GRADE criteria, the quality of evidence was moderate for all outcomes except all-cause mortality (low quality evidence) and adverse events (very low quality evidence).","We reviewed the evidence about the effect of clopidogrel and aspirin in people at high risk of getting heart disease or having a stroke, and in those who already have heart disease. Aspirin is widely used to prevent heart disease, but the effects for people at high risk of getting heart disease are small. We wanted to find out whether taking clopidogrel (which is also used to prevent heart disease) and aspirin is better to prevent getting heart disease or having a stroke than taking aspirin alone. We also wanted to find out if people who already had heart disease were at less risk of dying, having a heart attack or stroke if they took clopidogrel and aspirin. This review contains evidence up to July 2017. We found 15 studies which together included more than 30,000 people at high risk of heart disease who are taking aspirin. All studies randomly assigned participants to the intervention group (taking aspirin and clopidogrel) or the control group (taking aspirin and placebo (a pretend treatment that has no effect). Participants took clopidogrel between six weeks and 3.4 years, depending on the study they took part in. The results do not apply to people with recent placement of coronary stents (tubes inserted in the blood vessel to keep it open), who were excluded from this review. The results showed that there is a benefit of adding clopidogrel to aspirin in terms of reducing the risk of heart attack or stroke. However, there is a higher risk of major and minor bleeding associated with this. There was no effect on death due to heart problems or death from any cause. Using Cochrane criteria, four trials were at low risk of bias. Using GRADE standards, the quality of published evidence was moderate for most results, but low for death from any cause and very low for side effects.",1068,antiplatelet drug; cardiovascular disease; coronary disease; ischaemic cerebrovascular disease; peripheral arterial disease; atherothrombotic disease; coronary stent; myocardial infarction; ischaemic stroke; major bleeding,What was the primary motivation for the study?,What outcome was observed with adding clopidogrel to aspirin?,Select all of the following that are colors,Which adverse effect was noted when combining clopidogrel with aspirin?,,To assess whether adding clopidogrel to aspirin reduces heart disease risk.; To examine the impact of aspirin on coronary stents.; To determine the best time to take aspirin daily.,To assess whether adding clopidogrel to aspirin reduces heart disease risk.,Reduced risk of heart attack or stroke.; Increased risk of coronary stent complications.; Enhanced performance in physical activities.,Reduced risk of heart attack or stroke.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Higher risk of major and minor bleeding.; Increased likelihood of headaches.; Lower risk of developing high blood pressure.,Higher risk of major and minor bleeding.,,
64717245e1df4e34c97cca3f,static_1,Fixed-dose combination drug therapy for the prevention of heart disease and stroke,"Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) remains the leading cause of death and disability worldwide, yet many people still do not receive adequate treatment to control their risk factors. One strategy proposed to help address this gap is the use of a fixed-dose combination pill often called a polypill that combines blood pressure-lowering drugs, cholesterol-lowering medication, and sometimes antiplatelet therapy into a single tablet taken daily. This review evaluated whether such fixed-dose combination therapy leads to fewer deaths, fewer heart attacks and strokes, improved adherence to medication, and better control of cardiovascular risk factors compared with usual care, placebo, or taking medications separately. We included 13 randomised controlled trials involving a total of 9059 adults; four of these trials were new additions in this update. Most studies involved people without established ASCVD, and follow-up ranged from six weeks to nearly two years. Participants were generally in their early 60s, and about one-third were women. Newer studies tended to be larger, longer, and had a lower risk of bias. However, a major limitation across all trials was the inability to blind participants or researchers to the treatment since the fixed-dose pill differs visibly from usual care, which could influence reported outcomes. Overall, the effects of fixed-dose combination therapy on important clinical outcomes, such as death or major cardiovascular events, remain uncertain. About 1% of participants in both the fixed-dose and control groups died during the trials, showing no clear difference (risk ratio 1.10, 95% confidence interval 0.64 to 1.89). Similarly, the proportion of people who experienced a heart attack or stroke was small (4.7% in the fixed-dose group versus 3.7% in the control group), and the evidence did not show a clear effect (risk ratio 1.26, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.66). These findings are limited by the low number of events and the fact that most trials focused on risk factor changes rather than long-term outcomes. Side effects occurred commonly in both groups, but people taking the fixed-dose pill were somewhat more likely to report an adverse event (32% versus 27%), meaning a 16% increased risk. This is not unexpected since the polypill combines several medications known to cause side effects individually. Despite this, the fixed-dose combination showed consistent improvements in risk factor control. On average, systolic blood pressure was lowered by about 6 mmHg compared with usual care, and LDL cholesterol dropped by approximately 0.70 mmol/L. Total cholesterol also decreased modestly. However, these results showed substantial statistical variation between trials, so they should be interpreted cautiously. A key advantage of fixed-dose combination therapy was improved medication adherence. Across four studies, adherence to treatment was 44% higher among participants taking the polypill than among those receiving usual care. This suggests that simplifying treatment into a single pill may help more people take their medications consistently. In summary, while fixed-dose combination therapy improves blood pressure, cholesterol, and adherence, current evidence is insufficient to determine whether it reduces heart attacks, strokes, or deaths. Most trials were not designed or powered to assess these major outcomes, which likely explains the lack of clear effects. Fixed-dose therapy does appear to increase minor side effects but may help patients stay on treatment better. Ongoing and longer-term studies will be critical to determine whether the improvements in risk factors observed with polypill therapy eventually translate into meaningful reductions in cardiovascular events.","We examined the evidence on whether using fixed-dose combination drug therapy can help prevent heart attacks and strokes. This approach combines several medications typically drugs that lower blood pressure and cholesterol into a single pill. We identified 13 studies involving 9059 adults. The evidence is current up to September 2016. Researchers wanted to know if taking multiple preventive medications in a single pill was better or worse than usual care, placebo, or taking each drug separately. This updated review includes studies published since the previous Cochrane Review from 2014. Four of the included studies involved people who already had a previous heart attack or stroke, or who were at high risk of having one. Five studies followed participants for 12 months or longer. Most of the participants were middle-aged men with moderately high blood pressure or cholesterol levels, and two studies specifically included large numbers of Aboriginal or Maori participants. The fixed-dose pills in these trials contained between two and five medications, but all combinations included at least one drug to lower blood pressure and one to lower cholesterol. A major limitation across studies was that neither the participants nor the researchers could be blinded to the treatment, which could influence the results. The findings showed that it is still uncertain whether fixed-dose combination therapy reduces the risk of death, heart attacks, or strokes. Very few participants in the trials experienced these events less than 5% making it difficult to determine the true effect. The comparison with usual care also provided low-quality evidence, meaning confidence in these results is limited. Participants taking fixed-dose combination pills experienced more side effects compared with those in the control groups (32% versus 27%). This is expected because the medications involved such as aspirin, blood pressure-lowering drugs, and cholesterol-lowering drugsare known to cause side effects when taken individually. The combined pill may slightly reduce blood pressure by about 6 mmHg and lower LDL cholesterol by approximately 0.6 mmol/L, though these benefits were not seen consistently across all studies. Importantly, fixed-dose combination therapy did improve how regularly people took their preventive medications, suggesting better adherence overall. The overall quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to low, meaning that while some findings are fairly reliable, others remain uncertain. Ongoing and future clinical trials using fixed-dose combination therapy are expected to provide clearer evidence about its impact on major outcomes such as heart attacks, strokes, and deaths.",1048,Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; fixed-dose combination therapy; antiplatelet therapy; LDL cholesterol; systolic blood pressure; cardiovascular risk factors; placebo; cholesterol-lowering medication; blood pressure-lowering drugs; major cardiovascular events,How do the reported side effects of fixed-dose combination pills compare with usual care?,Which methodological limitations could affect the reliability of the studyÃ¢ÂÂs findings?,Select the items that are animals,"According to the findings, how did fixed-dose combination therapy affect medication adherence?",What effect did the fixed-dose combination pill have on blood pressure?,They are more frequent in the fixed-dose combination group.; They occur less frequently than in usual care.; The side effects are unrelated to the medications used.,They are more frequent in the fixed-dose combination group.,The inability to blind participants and researchers to treatment.; The inclusion of both men and women in the study.; The length of the follow-up period in some studies.,The inability to blind participants and researchers to treatment.; The length of the follow-up period in some studies.,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,It significantly improved adherence by simplifying treatment.; It reduced adherence due to increased side effects.; It had no impact on adherence as it was similar to usual care.,It significantly improved adherence by simplifying treatment.,It reduced systolic blood pressure by about 6 mmHg.; It increased systolic blood pressure by 5 mmHg.; It had no measurable impact on blood pressure.,It reduced systolic blood pressure by about 6 mmHg.
64717245e1df4e34c97cca3f,static_2,"Thymic peptides for treatment of cancer patients in addition to chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or both","Purified thymus extracts (pTE) and synthetic thymic peptides (sTP) are thought to enhance the immune system of cancer patients to help fight tumour growth and reduce infections caused by disease-related or treatment-related immunosuppression. This review evaluated the effectiveness of pTE and sTP for cancer management. Researchers searched major medical databases up to February 2010 for randomized trials in adult cancer patients where pTE or sTP were added to chemotherapy or radiotherapy and compared with the same regimen alone or with placebo. Data were independently extracted by two authors, and odds ratios were calculated for overall survival, disease-free survival, tumour response, and adverse effects. A random-effects model was used. Twenty-six trials involving 2736 patients were identified: 20 trials investigated pTE (thymostimulin or thymosin fraction 5) and six investigated sTP (thymopentin or thymosin ?1). Twenty-one trials reported overall survival, six reported disease-free survival, 14 reported tumour response, nine reported adverse effects, and 10 reported safety. Adding pTE showed no benefit for overall survival (RR 1.00), disease-free survival (RR 0.97), or tumour response (RR 1.07), with moderate to high heterogeneity. For thymosin ?1, the pooled RR for overall survival was 1.21 and for disease-free survival was 3.37, though neither result reached statistical significance. pTE reduced the risk of severe infectious complications (RR 0.54), and thymostimulin showed a non-significant trend toward reduced severe neutropenia. Both pTE and sTP were generally well tolerated. Many trials had at least moderate risk of bias. Overall, there is no clear evidence that adding pTE to cancer treatment improves survival or tumour response, although thymosin ?1 showed a possible trend toward benefit. There is preliminary evidence that pTE may reduce severe infectious complications during chemotherapy or radiotherapy.","The immune system plays a key role in the body's own defences against cancer cells. The thymus gland plays a central part in this and modifies T-cells, a subset of lymphocytes. Studies with thymic peptides have shown a variety of effects on the immune system. There are two groups of thymic peptides available for use in treatment: purified extracts from animal (mostly calf) thymus glands and synthetically produced thymus gland peptides.
This review aims to answer the question whether having thymic peptides can improve the response to and tolerability of standard chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or combined treatment. Further questions are whether the peptides inhibit or reduce the progression and recurrence of disease, whether they prolong the life of cancer patients and whether quality of life is improved. This review looked at the evidence from 26 clinical trials with a total of 2736 adult cancer patients. Many of the trials were small and of moderate quality. Only three studies were less than 10 years old. Thymosin ?1 is a synthetic peptide that shows some promise as a treatment option for patients with metastatic melanoma when used in addition to chemotherapy. Severe problems occur during chemotherapy and radiotherapy due to low white blood cell counts and infections. These were reduced by using purified thymus extracts. However, the use of purified thymus extracts should be investigated more thoroughly before the extracts are used routinely in patients. The findings were not conclusive and caution is advised.

64717245e1df4e34c97cca3f,static_2,Ivermectin for preventing and treating COVID-19,"Ivermectin, an antiparasitic agent, inhibits the replication of viruses in vitro, and the molecular hypothesis of its antiviral mode of action suggests an inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2 replication in early stages of infection, although current evidence on ivermectin for prevention of infection and treatment of COVID-19 is conflicting. The objective was to assess the efficacy and safety of ivermectin plus standard of care compared to standard of care plus or minus placebo, or any other proven intervention, for people with COVID-19 receiving inpatient or outpatient treatment, and for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection as postexposure prophylaxis. We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, Web of Science, WHO COVID-19 Global literature, and the HTA database weekly without language restrictions to 16 December 2021, and additionally included trials with more than 1000 participants up to April 2022. We included randomized controlled trials comparing ivermectin to standard of care, placebo, or another proven intervention for treatment of confirmed COVID-19, irrespective of disease severity or setting, and for prevention of infection, with co-interventions required to be the same in both groups; in this update we reappraised eligible trials for research integrity, including only prospectively registered RCTs according to WHO guidelines. We assessed RCTs for bias using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool and used GRADE to rate certainty of evidence for outcomes in inpatients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19, outpatients with mild COVID-19, and for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We excluded seven of the 14 trials from the previous review because six were not prospectively registered and one was non-randomized; the updated review includes 11 trials with 3409 participants investigating ivermectin plus standard of care compared to standard of care plus or minus placebo. No trial investigated ivermectin for prevention or compared it to an intervention with proven efficacy. Five trials treated moderate COVID-19 in inpatient settings and six treated mild COVID-19 in outpatient settings; eight trials were double-blind and placebo-controlled, and three were open-label, with around 50% of results assessed as low risk of bias. We identified 31 ongoing trials and 28 potentially eligible trials without published results or with reporting disparities, held in awaiting classification until authors clarify details. For treating moderate-to-severe inpatient COVID-19, we are uncertain whether ivermectin plus standard of care reduces or increases all-cause mortality at 28 days (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.14 to 2.51; 3 trials, 230 participants; very low-certainty evidence), clinical worsening measured by new need for ventilation or death (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.33 to 2.04; 2 trials, 118 participants; very low-certainty evidence), or serious adverse events (RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.07 to 35.89; 2 trials, 197 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Ivermectin plus standard of care may have little or no effect on clinical improvement measured by discharge alive at day 28 (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.35; 1 trial, 73 participants; low-certainty evidence), on any adverse events during the trial (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.79; 3 trials, 228 participants; low-certainty evidence), and on viral clearance at seven days (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.58; 3 trials, 231 participants; low-certainty evidence); no trial investigated quality of life. For treating outpatients with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19, ivermectin plus standard of care probably has little or no effect on all-cause mortality at day 28 (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.25; 6 trials, 2860 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and little or no effect on quality of life measured with the PROMIS Global-10 scale (physical and mental component MD 0.00, 95% CI ranges crossing 0; 1358 participants; high-certainty evidence). Ivermectin may have little or no effect on clinical worsening measured by hospital admission or death (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.20 to 6.02; 2 trials, 590 participants; low-certainty evidence), clinical improvement measured by resolution of symptoms by day 14 (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.36; 2 trials, 478 participants; low-certainty evidence), serious adverse events (RR 2.27, 95% CI 0.62 to 8.31; 5 trials, 1502 participants; low-certainty evidence), any adverse events (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.76; 5 trials, 1502 participants; low-certainty evidence), and viral clearance at day 7 (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.48; 2 trials, 331 participants; low-certainty evidence); no trials reporting duration of symptoms were eligible for meta-analysis. For outpatients, there is currently low- to high-certainty evidence that ivermectin has no beneficial effect for people with COVID-19, and based on very low-certainty evidence for inpatients, we remain uncertain whether ivermectin prevents death or clinical worsening or increases serious adverse events, while low-certainty evidence suggests no beneficial effect on clinical improvement, viral clearance, or adverse events; no evidence is available for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this update, certainty increased due to higher-quality trials with more participants, and according to the living review approach, searches will continue to be updated.","Ivermectin is a medicine used to treat parasites, such as intestinal parasites in animals and scabies in humans, and is inexpensive and widely used where parasitic infestations are common, with few unwanted effects; medical regulators have not approved ivermectin for COVID-19. We wanted to update our knowledge of whether ivermectin reduces death, illness, and length of infection in people with COVID-19, or is useful in prevention, and included trials comparing the medicine to placebo, usual care, or treatments known to work to some extent such as dexamethasone, while excluding trials comparing ivermectin to medicines that do not work, like hydroxychloroquine, or whose effectiveness is uncertain. We evaluated effects of ivermectin in infected people on people dying, whether COVID-19 got better or worse, quality of life, serious and non-serious unwanted effects, and viral clearance; for prevention, we sought effects on preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease. We searched for randomized controlled trials investigating ivermectin to prevent or treat COVID-19, requiring laboratory-confirmed infections for hospital or outpatient participants, and in this update also investigated trustworthiness of trials, including them only if they fulfilled clear ethical and scientific criteria; we compared and summarized results and rated confidence in the evidence based on common criteria such as trial methods and sizes. We excluded seven of the 14 trials from the previous review as they did not fulfil expected criteria, and with four new trials included 11 trials with 3409 participants investigating ivermectin with usual care compared with the same usual care or placebo; for treatment, five trials were in hospital with moderate COVID-19 and six trials in outpatients with mild COVID-19, using different doses and treatment durations, and no trial investigated ivermectin for prevention; we also found 31 ongoing trials and 28 additional trials requiring clarification or not yet published. Treating people in hospital with COVID-19, we do not know whether ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment leads to more or fewer deaths, worsens or improves condition measured by need for ventilation or death, or increases or reduces serious unwanted events; ivermectin may make little or no difference to improving condition measured by discharge or to non-serious unwanted events, and seven days after treatment may make little or no difference to reduction of negative tests. Treating outpatients with COVID-19, ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment probably makes little or no difference to people dying and makes little or no difference to quality of life; it may make little or no difference to worsening condition measured by admission or death, serious unwanted events, non-serious unwanted events, improvement of symptoms in 14 days, or negative tests at seven days. Our confidence in the evidence, especially for outpatients, improved since the last review because more participants were included in high-quality trials, and although we are quite certain about risk of dying and quality of life, confidence is still low for many other outcomes because few events were measured, methods differed, and not all relevant outcomes were reported.",1109,Ivermectin; SARS-CoV-2; antiparasitic agent; postexposure prophylaxis; co-interventions; WHO guidelines; all-cause mortality; serious adverse events; clinical improvement; viral clearance,How could the exclusion of certain trials from the analysis impact the confidence in the study's conclusions?,What are the implications of finding little or no effect of ivermectin on the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients?,Select all of the following that are colors,"Considering the studyÃ¢ÂÂs findings, how might future research on ivermectin's use in COVID-19 treatment be designed?",What was the main objective of the study discussed in the summary?,It increases confidence by ensuring higher-quality evidence; It decreases confidence as fewer trials are considered; It has no impact since only reliable data is excluded,It increases confidence by ensuring higher-quality evidence,Ivermectin should not be used as a standard treatment for COVID-19; Ivermectin should be used in combination with other treatments; The use of ivermectin is justified in certain emergency situations,Ivermectin should not be used as a standard treatment for COVID-19,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,"Focus on larger-scale, high-quality, double-blind trials; Incorporate non-randomized participants to increase diversity; Reduce the number of placebo controls to simplify results","Focus on larger-scale, high-quality, double-blind trials",To assess the efficacy and safety of ivermectin compared to standard care.; To measure the economic impact of ivermectin.; To develop new antiparasitic drugs.,To assess the efficacy and safety of ivermectin compared to standard care.
64717245e1df4e34c97cca3f,interactive_3,"Education, incentive, and engineering-based interventions to promotethe use of seat belts","Over 1.3 million people die each year as a result of traffic collisions and hundreds of thousands of others are permanently and seriouslyinjured. Most of these deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries, where mortality rates can be up to 10 times higher than those ofsome high-income countries. Seat belts are designed to accomplish two key functions: to prevent the occupant from being ejected fromthe vehicle by the force of impact, and to extend the time that the decelerating force is applied to a person. Seat belts also spread the area ofimpact both to larger and less vulnerable parts of the body. Since the 1950s, seat belts have been factory-fitted to most vehicles, and todayaround 90% of high-income countries have adopted seat belt legislation that makes it mandatory for some, if not all, vehicle occupants towear seat belts. However, the simple passing of laws is not sufficient to ensure seat belt use, and, while the enforcement of seat belt lawsdoes increase seat belt use, other interventions have been developed to encourage voluntary  and hence sustainable behaviour change. To evaluate the benefits of behavioural-change interventions (educational-based, incentive-based, engineering-based, or a combination,but not enforcement-based) that promote the use of seat belts, and to determine which types of interventions are most effective. On 9 August 2022, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), OvidSP Embase, OvidSP MEDLINE, 14other databases, and clinical trials registers. We also screened reference lists and conference proceedings, searched websites of relevantorganisations, and contacted road safety experts. The search was performed with no restrictions in terms of language and date ofpublication. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), both individually randomised and cluster-randomised, that evaluated education,engineering, incentive-based interventions (or combinations) that promoted seat belt use. Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of RCTs, evaluated the risk of bias, and extracted data. We performed a narrativesynthesis based on effect direction due to the heterogeneity observed between RCTs and reported the synthesis in accordance with reporting guidelines for systematic reviews without meta-analysis, as appropriate. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using theGRADE approach. We analysed data on the primary outcome, frequency of wearing a seat belt. None of the included RCTs reported theother primary outcome, crash-related injury rate or the secondary outcome, crash-related mortality rates of interest in this review. We included 15 completed RCTs (12 individual, parallel-group, and three cluster) that enroled 12,081 participants, published between1990 and 2022. Four trials were published between 2019 and 2022, and the remaining trials were published 10 or more years ago. Wealso identified four ongoing RCTs. Thirteen RCTs were conducted in the USA. Trials recruited participants from various sites (worksites,schools, emergency departments, a residential retirement community, and primary care settings) and different age groups (adults,late adolescents, early adolescents, and dyads). Thirteen trials investigated educational interventions, one of which used education inaddition to incentives (one of the intervention arms) measured through participant self-reports (12) and observation (one), and two trialsinvestigated engineering-based interventions measured through in-vehicle data monitor systems at various follow-up periods (six weeksto 36 months). We grouped RCTs according to types of education-based interventions: behavioural education-based, health risk appraisal (HRA), andother education-based interventions. The evidence suggests that behavioural education-based (four trials) interventions may promoteseat belt use and HRA interventions (one trial) likely promote seat belt use in the short term (six weeks to nine months). Four of the sixtrials that investigated behavioural education-based interventions found that the intervention compared to no or another interventionmay promote seat belt use. These effects were measured through participant self-report and at various time points (six-week to 12-monthfollow-up) (low-certainty evidence). One of the three trials investigating HRA only or with additional intervention versus no or anotherintervention showed observed effects likely to promote seat belt use (moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence suggests that engineering-based interventions using vehicle monitoring systems (with in-vehicle alerts and with or withoutnotifications/feedback) may promote the use of seat belts. One trial showed that engineering interventions (in-vehicle alerts and feedback)may promote seat belt use while the other showed unclear effects in two of the three intervention groups (low-certainty evidence). Bothtrials had small sample sizes and high baseline seat belt use. The evidence suggests that behavioural education-based interventions may promote seat belt use and HRA (including incentives) with orwithout additional interventions likely promote seat belt use. Likewise, for engineering-based interventions using in-vehicle data monitorsystems with in-vehicle alerts, with or without notifications/feedback the evidence suggests the interventions may promote the use ofseat belts. Well-designed RCTs are needed to further investigate the effectiveness of education and engineering-based interventions. High-qualitytrials that examine the potential benefits of incentives to promote seat belt use, either alone or in combination with other interventions, aswell as trials to investigate other types of interventions (such as technology, media/publicity, enforcement, insurance schemes, employerprogrammes, etc.) to promote the use of seat belts, are needed. Evidence from low- and middle-income economies is required to improvethe generalisability of the data. In addition, research focused on determining which interventions or types of interventions are mosteffective in different population groups is needed.","Why is wearing a seat belt important? Many people, mostly children and young adults, die each year as a result of road traffic injuries suggesting it to be a leading cause of death with around 75% of traffic-related deaths occurring among young males. Many others are permanently and seriously injured. Seat belts are designed to protect occupants from being thrown out of the vehicle by the force of impact, and spread the impact across less vulnerable parts of the body to lessen the damage. Passing laws mandating seat belt use is not sufficient to encourage seat belt use on its own. We investigated the effectiveness of education, incentive, or engineering-based interventions, but not law enforcement, to encourage seat belt use and determine which types of interventions are most effective. Educational-based interventions are structured programmes teaching drivers and passengers the importance of using seat belts. Engineering-based interventions are design changes to the vehicle structure that promote the wearing of seat belts, such as seat belt alarms, while incentives include rewards schemes. We searched for studies that randomly allocated people travelling in passenger or commercial vehicles to interventions aiming to improve seat belt use. We excluded people travelling in farming or agricultural vehicles since these are not deemed commercial vehicles. Two review authors independently evaluated studies to judge inclusion in the review. We recorded information about the study design, setting, participants, interventions, and outcomes. In terms of outcome, we looked at the frequency of wearing a seat belt as well as crash-related injuries and deaths. Because of the differences between the included studies, we provided a written account and assessed how much each result could be trusted using the ratings high, moderate, low, or very low quality, depending on our confidence in the reliability of the results. We summarised the findings and compared study results. We found 15 studies enrolling 12,081 participants and four ongoing studies. Thirteen studies were conducted in the USA and enrolled participants from various sites (worksites, schools, emergency departments, a residential retirement community, and primary care settings) and of different age groups (adults, late and early adolescents, and dyads of child/adolescent and parent/legal guardian). Twelve studies looked at educational interventions alone, one at education and incentives, and two at engineering-based interventions. All included studies reported on the frequency of wearing a seat belt; however, most studies (12) reported this outcome through participant self-reporting. The remaining studies reported the frequency of wearing a seat belt through in-vehicle data monitoring systems (two studies) and observation (one study). None of the included studies reported crash-related injuries and deaths. Some evidence suggests that education-based and engineering-based interventions may promote seat belt use; however, we cannot be confident in the current evidence. For education-based interventions, evidence suggests that behavioural-based (motivational interviews, behavioural change counselling, and behavioural messages) and HRA (alone or with educational information plus incentive) interventions may improve seat belt use in early adolescents, late adolescents, and adults. The evidence suggests that engineering-based interventions may promote seat belt use in early adolescents and adults. More research is needed to better understand the effectiveness of education- and engineering-based interventions on seat belt use. In addition, high-quality research is needed to investigate the benefit of incentives alone or in combination with other interventions as well as research to investigate other types of interventions, different combinations of interventions, settings (such as low- and middle-income countries), and populations. Only two studies looked at engineering-based interventions to improve seat belt use and both studies enrolled a small number of participants making it challenging to conclude that these interventions are beneficial. Trials investigating educational interventions to improve seat belt use vary in terms of the type of intervention, quality, number and types of people in the study, etc. Studies included children, adolescents, and adults; however, the most effective intervention for each population group remains unclear. Our confidence in the evidence was low or moderate, mainly due to the outcome (wearing seat belts) being measured through participant self-reporting. Self-reported outcomes are open to being influenced by participants answering in a manner they believe to be desirable or by participants' limited recollection of the event being studied. None of the included studies was conducted in countries where deaths and injuries related to road traffic accidents are the highest.",1059,mortality rates; decelerating force; behavioural-change interventions; crash-related injury rate; engineering-based interventions; health risk appraisal,What factors might have contributed to the low certainty of evidence in the current study?,Identify the main goal of the study discussed in the summary.,Select all of the following that are colors,Summarize why seat belt laws alone are insufficient according to the summary.,Recognize the types of interventions evaluated in the study.,Inconsistencies in definitions of seat belt use.; Differences in intervention effectiveness across studies.; Inclusion of outdated intervention methods.,Differences in intervention effectiveness across studies.,To determine the most effective seat belt laws.; To evaluate interventions that promote seat belt use.; To analyze the decrease in car accidents.,To evaluate interventions that promote seat belt use.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Laws alone do not guarantee behavior change.; People do not understand the fines involved.; Drivers forget to read laws regularly.,Laws alone do not guarantee behavior change.,"Educational, incentive, and engineering-based.; Law enforcement and punishment-based.; Technological and media-based.","Educational, incentive, and engineering-based."
64717245e1df4e34c97cca3f,interactive_4,Which exercise is better for reducing fatigue caused by cancer: cardiovascular or resistance training?,"With prevalence estimates between 50% and 90% of people with cancer, cancer-related fatigue is one of the most common morbidities related to cancer and its treatment. Exercise is beneficial for the treatment of cancer-related fatigue. However, the efficacy of different types of exercise (i.e. cardiovascular training and resistance training) have not yet been investigated systematically and compared directly in a meta-analysis.
To compare the benefits and harms of cardiovascular training versus resistance training for treatment or prevention of cancer-related fatigue in people with cancer.
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and five other databases in January 2023. We searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials. We integrated results from update searches of previously published Cochrane reviews. In total, our searches included trials from inception to October 2023.
We included randomised controlled trials investigating cardiovascular training compared with resistance training, with exercise as the main component. We included studies on adults with cancer (aged 18 years and older), with or without a diagnosis of cancer-related fatigue, for any type of cancer and any type of cancer treatment, with the intervention starting before, during, or after treatment. We included trials evaluating at least one of our primary outcomes (cancer-related fatigue or quality of life). We excluded combined cardiovascular and resistance interventions, yoga, and mindfulness-based interventions. Our primary outcomes were cancer-related fatigue and quality of life. Our secondary outcomes were adverse events, anxiety, and depression.
We used standard Cochrane methodology. For analyses, we pooled results within the same period of outcome assessment (i.e. short term (up to and including 12 weeks' follow-up), medium term (more than 12 weeks' to less than six months' follow-up), and long term (six months' follow-up or longer)). We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane RoB 1 tool, and certainty of the evidence using GRADE.
We included six studies with 447 participants with prostate, breast, or lung cancer who received radiotherapy or chemotherapy, had surgery, or a combination of these. All studies had a high risk of bias due to lack of blinding. Three studies had an additional high risk of bias domain; one study for attrition bias, and two studies for selection bias. Interventions in the cardiovascular training groups included training on a cycle ergometer, treadmill, an elliptical trainer, or indoor bike. Interventions in the resistance training group included a varying number of exercises using bodyweight, weights, or resistance bands. Interventions varied in frequency, intensity, and duration. None of the included studies reported including participants with a confirmed cancer-related fatigue diagnosis. The interventions in four studies started during cancer treatment and in two studies after cancer treatment. Before treatment No studies reported interventions starting before cancer treatment. During treatment the evidence was very uncertain about the effect of cardiovascular training compared with resistance training for short-term cancer-related fatigue (mean difference (MD)-0.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.52 to 1.84; 4 studies, 311 participants; Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue) scale where higher values indicate better outcome; very low-certainty evidence) and long-term cancer-related fatigue (MD 1.30, 95% CI: 2.17 to 4.77; 1 study, 141 participants; FACIT-Fatigue scale; very low-certainty evidence). The evidence was very uncertain about the effect of cardiovascular training compared with resistance training for short-term quality of life (MD 1.47, 95% CI -1.47 to 4.42; 4 studies, 319 participants; Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy General scale where higher values indicate better outcome; very low-certainty evidence) and for long-term quality of life (MD 3.40, 95% CI -4.85 to 11.65; 1 study, 141 participants; Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Anemia scale where higher values indicate better outcome; very low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of cardiovascular training compared with resistance training on the occurrence of adverse events at any follow-up (risk ratio (RR) 2.00, 95% CI 0.19 to 21.18; 2 studies, 128 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No studies reported medium-term cancer-related fatigue or quality of life. After treatment, the evidence was very uncertain about the effect of cardiovascular training compared with resistance training for short-term cancer-related fatigue (MD 1.47, 95% CI -0.09 to 3.03; 1 study, 95 participants; Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory 20 General Fatigue subscale where higher values indicate worse outcome; very low-certainty evidence). Resistance training may improve short-term quality of life compared to cardiovascular training, but the evidence is very uncertain (MD -10.96, 95% CI -17.77 to -4.15; 1 study, 95 participants; European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30 Global Health subscale where higher values indicate better outcome; very low-certainty evidence). No studies reported outcomes at medium-term or long-term follow-up. Overall, the evidence is very uncertain about the effects of cardiovascular training compared with resistance training on treatment of cancer-related fatigue in people with cancer. Larger, well-conducted studies including people with different cancer types receiving different treatments are needed to increase the certainty in the evidence and to better understand who may benefit most from cardiovascular or resistance training. Moreover, studies comparing the effects of cardiovascular and resistance training initiated before as well as after cancer treatment are needed to understand the prophylactic and rehabilitative effects of these exercise types on cancer-related fatigue.","Fatigue caused by cancer is a feeling of extreme tiredness that lasts for a long time. It is related to cancer or cancer treatment, or both. It affects both the body and feelings, and can make it difficult to do regular activities. Fatigue caused by cancer is a lot worse than regular tiredness, and it does not go away with more sleep or rest.
We wanted to find out if there are differences between cardiovascular training and resistance training for the treatment and prevention of fatigue caused by cancer, well-being (also known as quality of life), and unwanted effects. Cardiovascular training involves exercise such as walking, running, swimming, and cycling, whereas resistance training includes exercise using one's own bodyweight, weights, or elastic therapy bands.
We searched for studies that compared cardiovascular training and resistance training in people with any type of cancer. Training could have been started before, during, or after cancer treatment.
We summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.
We found six studies that involved 447 people with breast cancer, prostate cancer (a small gland in the pelvis that is part of the male reproductive system), or lung cancer. These studies did not report if people already had fatigue caused by cancer before starting to exercise. People in these studies were treated with chemotherapy (medicines to kill the cancer), radiotherapy (radiation directed at the cancer to reduce or kill it), surgery (to remove the cancer), or a combination of these. The cardiovascular or resistance training started during or after cancer treatment. Most studies looked at short-term results (up to and including 12 weeks of monitoring), only one study had long-term results (six months or longer of monitoring). Studies were supported by research grants and took place in Canada, Belgium, the USA, and Germany.
The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of cardiovascular and resistance training on fatigue caused by cancer, well-being, and unwanted effects in the short or long term.
Our confidence in the evidence is very low. We found only a few studies including low numbers of people. We also found problems in the methods of the studies.

64717245e1df4e34c97cca3f,interactive_4,How accurate are alternative laboratory-based molecular tests (to RT-PCR with prior RNA extraction/purification) for identifying people infected by SARS-CoV-2?,"Diagnosing people with a SARS-CoV-2 infection played a critical role in managing the COVID-19 pandemic and remains a priority for the transition to long-term management of COVID-19. Initial shortages of extraction and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) reagents impaired the desired upscaling of testing in many countries, which led to the search for alternatives to RNA extraction/purification and RT-PCR testing. Reference standard methods for diagnosing the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection rely primarily on real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Alternatives to RT-PCR could, if sufficiently accurate, have a positive impact by expanding the range of diagnostic tools available for the timely identification of people infected by SARS-CoV-2, access to testing and the use of resources. We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of alternative (to RT-PCR assays) laboratory-based molecular tests for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection. We searched the COVID-19 Open Access Project living evidence database from the University of Bern until 30 September 2020 and the WHO COVID-19 Research Database until 31 October 2022, with no language restrictions. We included studies of people with suspected or known SARS-CoV-2 infection, or where tests were used to screen for infection, and studies evaluating commercially developed laboratory-based molecular tests for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection considered as alternatives to RT-PCR testing, and we included all reference standards to define the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2, including RT-PCR tests and established clinical diagnostic criteria. Two authors independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and applicability using the QUADAS-2 tool. We presented sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals for each test using paired forest plots and summarised results using average sensitivity and specificity with a bivariate random-effects meta-analysis, illustrating the findings per index test category and assay brand compared to the WHO's acceptable sensitivity and specificity thresholds for nucleic acid tests. We included data from 64 studies reporting 94 cohorts of participants and 105 index test evaluations, with 74,753 samples and 7517 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases. We did not identify any published or preprint reports of accuracy for a considerable number of commercially produced NAAT assays. Most cohorts were judged at unclear or high risk of bias in more than three QUADAS-2 domains; around half were at high risk of selection bias because of recruitment based on COVID status; and three quarters were at high risk of bias in the reference standard domain due to reliance on a single RT-PCR result or unclear diagnostic timing, missing results, or absent participant flow diagrams. For test categories with four or more evaluations allowing summary estimates, RT-PCR assays designed to omit/adapt RNA extraction/purification had average sensitivity of 95.1% (95% CI 91.1% to 97.3%) and specificity of 99.7% (95% CI 98.5% to 99.9%; 27 evaluations, 2834 samples and 1178 cases); RT-LAMP assays had average sensitivity of 88.4% (95% CI 83.1% to 92.2%) and specificity of 99.7% (95% CI 98.7% to 99.9%; 24 evaluations, 29,496 samples and 2255 cases); TMA assays had average sensitivity of 97.6% (95% CI 95.2% to 98.8%) and specificity of 99.4% (95% CI 94.9% to 99.9%; 14 evaluations, 2196 samples and 942 cases); digital PCR assays had average sensitivity of 98.5% (95% CI 95.2% to 99.5%) and specificity of 91.4% (95% CI 60.4% to 98.7%; 5 evaluations, 703 samples and 354 cases); RT-LAMP assays omitting/adapting RNA extraction had average sensitivity of 73.1% (95% CI 58.4% to 84%) and specificity of 100% (95% CI 98% to 100%; 24 evaluations, 14,342 samples and 1502 cases). Only two index categories fulfilled WHO-acceptable requirements: RT-PCR assays designed to omit/adapt RNA extraction/purification and TMA assays. At 5% prevalence in a cohort of 1000 people, the positive predictive value of RT-PCR assays omitting/adapting extraction is 94%, with three false positives among 51 positive results and about two missed cases; for TMA assays, positive predictive value is 89%, with six false positives among 55 positive results and around one missed case. Alternative laboratory-based molecular tests aim to enhance testing capacity by reducing time, steps, and resource requirements. Several technologies with potential advantages have not been evaluated or were assessed by few low-quality studies, so performance remains undetermined. Only RT-PCR assays designed to omit/adapt RNA extraction/purification and TMA assays fulfil WHO accuracy standards and may be suitable alternatives when RT-PCR is inaccessible. However, findings must be interpreted with caution due to limitations, including reliance on retrospective samples without symptom information, dominant representation of specific high-performing brands (21/26 and 12/14 studies), and methodological weaknesses. Although we used comprehensive searches and broad inclusion criteria, further research is needed to evaluate alternative COVID-19 tests and their role in pandemic management.","Laboratory-based molecular assays (tests) aim to confirm or rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection in people. Alternatives to RT-PCR assays have been developed to minimise the steps needed to process samples in the laboratory or use fewer resources to obtain the same valid results. For this review, we focus on tests commercially developed by a manufacturer, providing instructions for their professional use. People with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection should know if they are infected to self-isolate, receive treatment, and inform close contacts. Failure to detect SARS-CoV-2 when it is present risks spreading infection and results in missed opportunities for prevention. Diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection when it is not present may lead to unnecessary self-isolation and testing of close contacts. Currently, testing to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection relies on a laboratory molecular test called RT-PCR. This requires specialist equipment and can take 24 hours to produce a result. If assays that take less time or use readily available resources were sufficiently accurate to replace RT-PCR testing, this could increase the number of tests that could be done, allow faster diagnosis and enable people to take appropriate action more quickly. We wanted to know whether commercially developed, alternative laboratory-based molecular tests are accurate enough to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to RT-PCR. We looked for studies investigating these tests in people (or samples) that were also tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection using RT-PCR which modified RT-PCR by removing or altering components of this testing process. We included 105 evaluations evaluating alternatives to RT-PCR in the review. The main results are based on 74,753 samples, and SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed in 7517 of these samples. Most evaluations (27/105) concerned various test types specifically designed to omit/adapt RNA extraction/purification. Twenty-four of 105 evaluations concerned various test types operating at one temperature (isothermal tests) rather than cycling through different temperatures. Twenty-four of 105 evaluations were concerned with various test types that combined these two alternative approaches. Only tests specifically designed to omit/adapt RNA extraction/purification and TMA assays with RNA extraction (a type of isothermal test) met WHO-acceptable standards for confirming and ruling out SARS-CoV-2. For illustration, the results of these studies indicate that in a group of 1000 people, 50 of whom (5%) actually have SARS-CoV-2: for tests specifically designed to omit/adapt RNA extraction/purification, 51 people would test positive for SARS-CoV-2, of these, three people (6%) would not have SARS-CoV-2 (false-positive result), and 949 people would test negative for SARS-CoV-2, of these, two people (0.2%) would actually have SARS-CoV-2 (false-negative result); for TMA tests with RNA extraction, 55 people would test positive for SARS-CoV-2, of these, six people (10%) would not have SARS-CoV-2 (false-positive result), and 945 people would test negative for SARS-CoV-2, of these, one person (0.1%) would actually have SARS-CoV-2 (false-negative result). Most included studies did not provide information on participants who underwent testing, such as whether they had symptoms or were close contacts of a SARS-CoV-2 case. We also had concerns about the method of recruiting participants for the majority of included studies, which may have resulted in an overestimation of the accuracy of these methods. In addition, the method used to determine whether individuals did not have SARS-CoV-2 infection was not considered reliable for most studies, which may have resulted in underestimating the accuracy of these methods. Some studies did not follow the manufacturers' instructions for using the test. Results from different test brands using the same technique varied. The studies included in this review suggest that two laboratory-based molecular tests might be accurate enough to replace or supplement RT-PCR tests with prior RNA extraction/purification for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection: RT-PCR tests developed to omit or adapt RNA extraction or purification and TMA isothermal tests (retaining an RNA extraction step). Other alternative tests to RT-PCR were assessed just by a few studies of limited methodological quality, and their performance should be evaluated by additional studies. Furthermore, data in these studies mostly relied on samples acquired in the past (compared to current or future samples), thus further evaluation of these tests in real clinical practice scenarios is required. Also, decisions on the optimal test for a specific setting will be driven not only by diagnostic accuracy, but also by other factors such as test complexity, time to result, acceptability to those being tested, and the setting in which the tests are to be used.",1112,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
64717245e1df4e34c97cca3f,finetuned_5,Does yoga relieve cancer-related fatigue in people with cancer?,"Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is one of the most prevalent symptoms in individuals with cancer. Various types of exercise have shown beneficial effects. While previous systematic reviews suggest exercise may improve CRF and quality of life, evidence specifically about yoga's impact, as well as evidence on long-term effects, is limited. Previous syntheses offer promising but inconclusive findings on yoga's effectiveness. This review is one of a suite of five reviews exploring exercise for cancer-related fatigue.
To assess the effects of yoga versus no yoga on cancer-related fatigue in people with cancer: before, during, and after anticancer treatment; in the short, medium, and long term; and effects on quality of life (QoL), adverse events, depression, and anxiety.
We used CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, five other databases and two trials registers, together with reference checking, citation searching and contact with study authors to identify studies that are included in the review. The latest search date was October 2023.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing yoga to no yoga. We included studies in adults (aged 18 and older) with any type of cancer and anticancer therapy who received yoga before, during, or after anticancer therapy. We included trials evaluating at least one of the main outcomes (CRF or QoL). Yoga had to last for at least five sessions, and involve face-to-face instruction. We excluded trials with fewer than 20 participants randomised per group.
The outcomes of interest in this review are cancer-related fatigue (CRF), quality of life (QoL), adverse events, depression, and anxiety. We used standard methods expected by Cochrane. For analyses, we pooled results within the same period of outcome assessment (i.e. short, medium, and long term), and employed a random-effects model. We assessed risk of bias with the Cochrane risk of bias (RoB) 1 tool, and used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence.
We included 21 RCTs with 2041 people with cancer who received yoga during (13 studies) or after (eight studies) anticancer therapy; none examined yoga initiated before therapy. Here we present results on CRF and QoL; findings on adverse events, depression, and anxiety are in the full review. Yoga during anticancer therapy The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of yoga compared to no yoga on: short-term CRF (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.18 to 0.32; mean difference (MD) on Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI; lower values mean better outcome) of 0.16, 95% CI -0.41 to 0.71; 3 studies, 253 participants); medium-term CRF (MD on Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI; lower values mean better outcome) of -1.30, 95% CI -3.50 to 0.90; 1 study, 67 participants); and long-term CRF (MD 0.09 on BFI, 95% CI 1.16 to 0.98; 2 studies, 155 participants) (all very low-certainty evidence). Yoga may have a small beneficial effect or no effect compared to no yoga on short-term QoL (SMD 0.25, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.45; MD on Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30 (QLQ-C30; higher values mean better outcome) of 5.28, 95% CI 0.84 to 9.56; 4 studies, 374 participants) and medium-term QoL (MD on QLQ-C30 of 7.63, 95% CI 6.71 to 21.97; 2 studies, 151 participants), but the evidence is very uncertain (all very low-certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported long-term QoL. Yoga after anticancer therapy Yoga probably has a beneficial effect compared to no yoga on short-term CRF (SMD -0.26, 95% CI -0.42 to -0.09; MD 2.55, 95% CI 0.88 to 4.12; higher values mean better outcome; 5 studies, 602 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Yoga might have a beneficial effect or no effect compared to no yoga on medium-term CRF, but the evidence is very uncertain (MD 3.02, 95% CI -1.48 to 7.52; 1 study, 54 participants (higher values mean better outcome; very low-certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported long-term CRF. Yoga may have a small beneficial effect or no effect compared to no yoga on short-term QoL (SMD 0.19, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.47; MD -3.27, 95% CI -8.08 to 1.55; higher values mean better outcome; 4 studies, 275 participants) and medium term QoL (MD 7.06, 95% CI -1.38 to 15.50; 1 study, 54 participants; higher values mean better outcome), but the evidence is very uncertain (all very low-certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported long-term QoL. A key limitation of the review was the included studies' methodological constraints: participants' awareness of treatment assignments (yoga or control) potentially introduced bias. Additionally, sample sizes were too small to determine medium- and long-term effects conclusively. Further research is needed to evaluate the sustainability of yoga's impact on cancer-related fatigue, quality of life, and adverse events.
Our review provides uncertain evidence of the beneficial effects of yoga initiated during or after anticancer therapy compared to no yoga for people with cancer. Although there are indications supporting the use of yoga to address CRF, the uncertainty of the evidence underscores the need for caution in its implementation. Future RCTs should employ rigorous methodologies, enroll sufficient participants, and use appropriate controls.","Cancer-related fatigue is a feeling of extreme tiredness that lasts for a long time. It can be caused by cancer, cancer therapy, or both. Cancer-related fatigue affects the body and mood and makes it hard to perform regular activities. It is stronger than just being tired and does not go away by resting. Clinical guidelines recommend physical exercise to improve cancer-related fatigue. Physical exercise affects cancer-related fatigue by influencing biological and psychological processes, but it is unclear what types of exercise may be most beneficial. Yoga may reduce cancer-related fatigue and improve quality of life because it combines physical movement with breath control, mental focus, and body awareness. This review explored whether yoga improves cancer-related fatigue and quality of life in adults. We also examined whether any adverse events occurred in the studies. We investigated short-term (up to 12 weeks), medium-term (12 weeks to 6 months), and long-term (more than 6 months) effects. We searched for studies comparing yoga with no yoga in adults with any cancer, including yoga done before, during, or after anticancer therapy. Multiple types of yoga were included, such as Hatha and Dru yoga. We compared and summarised the results, assessed study quality, and considered differences based on type of yoga, cancer type, format of exercise (group vs individual; supervised vs unsupervised), and participant age. We found 21 studies involving 2041 participants with various cancers, mostly women with breast cancer. Yoga was initiated during anticancer therapy in 13 studies and after therapy in eight studies; no studies examined yoga before treatment. It is unclear whether yoga during anticancer therapy improves short, medium, or long-term cancer-related fatigue. Yoga during therapy may increase short- and medium-term quality of life, but the evidence is very uncertain, and no studies measured long-term quality of life. Only one study reported adverse events, so it is unclear whether yoga affects safety outcomes. No meaningful differences were found between different yoga types, training formats, supervision levels, or cancer types. Yoga after anticancer therapy probably reduces short-term cancer-related fatigue, but its effects on medium-term fatigue are unclear, and long-term fatigue was not measured. Yoga after therapy may slightly increase short and medium-term quality of life, but evidence is very uncertain, and long-term outcomes were not assessed. It is also unclear whether yoga after therapy leads to adverse events, and no differences were found between yoga types, cancer types, or age groups. Limitations include lack of blinding, which may influence results, and small or insufficiently long studies for several outcomes. More research is needed to determine how sustainable the effects of yoga are on cancer-related fatigue, quality of life, and adverse events.",1014,Cancer-related fatigue; anticancer therapy; quality of life; adverse events; Brief Fatigue Inventory; Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory; Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30,What factors were examined to assess study quality and differences in yoga's effects?,What is the potential impact of yoga on medium-term quality of life for cancer patients?,Select the items that are animals,What was the primary focus of the study reviewed in the plain-language summary?,What uncertainty is highlighted in the evidence regarding yoga's effect on quality of life during anticancer therapy?,"Type of yoga, format of exercise, and participant age; Geographic location of studies; Financial support of participants","Type of yoga, format of exercise, and participant age",The impact is unclear due to very uncertain evidence; There is a definite significant improvement; It consistently decreases quality of life,The impact is unclear due to very uncertain evidence,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,To compare the effects of different types of yoga on weight loss; To assess the impact of yoga on cancer-related fatigue and quality of life; To examine dietary interventions for cancer patients,To assess the impact of yoga on cancer-related fatigue and quality of life,No studies assessed long-term quality of life; Yoga significantly decreases quality of life; Certainty of increased short- and medium-term quality of life,No studies assessed long-term quality of life
64717245e1df4e34c97cca3f,finetuned_6,Psychosocial interventions for the prevention of disability following traumatic physical injury,"Traumatic physical injury can result in many disabling sequelae including physical and mental health problems and impaired social functioning.
To assess the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions in the prevention of physical, mental and social disability following traumatic physical injury.
The search was not restricted by date, language or publication status. We searched the following electronic databases; Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 1), MEDLINE (Ovid SP), EMBASE (Ovid SP), PsycINFO (Ovid SP), Controlled Trials metaRegister (www.controlled-trials.com), AMED (Allied & Complementary Medicine), ISI Web of Science: Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI), PubMed. We also screened the reference lists of all selected papers and contacted authors of relevant studies. The latest search for trials was in February 2008.
Randomised controlled trials that consider one or more defined psychosocial interventions for the prevention of physical disability, mental health problems or reduced social functioning as a result of traumatic physical injury. We excluded studies that included patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Two authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of search results, reviewed the full text of potentially relevant studies, independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. We included five studies, involving 756 participants. Three studies assessed the effect of brief psychological therapies, one assessed the impact of a self-help booklet, and one the effect of collaborative care. The disparate nature of the trials covering different patient populations, interventions and outcomes meant that it was not possible to pool data meaningfully across studies. There was no evidence of a protective effect of brief psychological therapy or educational booklets on preventing disability. There was evidence from one trial of a reduction in both post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depressive symptoms one month after injury in those who received a collaborative care intervention combined with a brief psycho-educational intervention, however this was not retained at follow up. Overall mental health status was the only disability outcome affected by any intervention. In three trials the psychosocial intervention had a detrimental effect on the mental health status of patients. This review provides no convincing evidence of the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for the prevention of disability following traumatic physical injury. Taken together, our findings cannot be considered as supporting the provision of psychosocial interventions to prevent aspects of disability arising from physical injury. However, these conclusions are based on a small number of disparate trials with small to moderate sample sizes and are therefore necessarily cautious. More research, using larger sample sizes, and similar interventions and patient populations to enable pooling of results, is needed before these findings can be confirmed.","Traumatic physical injury such as that resulting from road traffic accidents, falls and fires can cause high levels of subsequent disability in the person affected. This may include physical disability as a result of the initial injury and subsequent complications, mental health problems such as depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a result of the trauma of the event which caused the injury and the resulting physical and social problems, and social problems such as loss of social life and unemployment. It is therefore important to evaluate interventions which seek to prevent these adverse secondary outcomes. Psychosocial interventions, which include psychological therapies such as interpersonal counselling and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), and social interventions such as befriending, social support and self-help advice, delivered soon after the injury, may help to prevent these problems.
This review identified five randomised controlled trials, involving 756 participants, which evaluated psychosocial interventions for the prevention of disability following traumatic injury. No convincing evidence was found supporting the efficacy of these interventions. In particular, self-help booklets and interpersonal therapies had no effect on preventing disability. There was some evidence that a more complex intervention involving collaborative care reduced symptoms of depression and PTSD in the short but not the medium term. There was evidence from three trials that psychosocial interventions had a detrimental effect on mental health. Taken together, our findings cannot be taken as supporting the provision of psychosocial interventions to prevent aspects of disability arising from physical injury. These results suggest that future interventions should focus on screening patients at risk of poor outcomes and only treating those who develop subsequent problems. However, the strength of these conclusions is limited by the small size and varied nature of many of the trials, which means that their results cannot be pooled.",1060,psychosocial interventions; traumatic physical injury; disabling sequelae; physical disability; mental health problems; social functioning; collaborative care; post-traumatic stress disorder; depressive symptoms; psycho-educational intervention,What types of disabilities can traumatic physical injury cause?,Identify the primary purpose of evaluating psychosocial interventions in the context of traumatic injuries.,Select all of the following that are colors,Which psychosocial intervention showed short-term efficacy in reducing depressive symptoms?,Explain the overall finding regarding the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions after a traumatic injury.,Physical and mental health problems; Improved social interactions; Increased employment opportunities,Physical and mental health problems,To prevent adverse secondary outcomes; To reduce the cost of medical treatments; To enhance physical strength,To prevent adverse secondary outcomes,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Collaborative care intervention; Self-help booklet; Interpersonal therapy,Collaborative care intervention,No convincing evidence supports their efficacy; Effective in preventing all types of disability; Significantly improved physical recovery,No convincing evidence supports their efficacy
64717245e1df4e34c97cca3f,finetuned_6,Best therapy for people with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who have not been treated without a targetable mutation and moderately impaired performance status,"Most people who are newly diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have advanced disease. For these people, survival is determined by various patient- and tumor-related factors, of which the performance status (PS) is the most important prognostic factor. People with PS 0 or 1 are usually treated with systemic therapies, whereas people with PS 3 or 4 most often receive supportive care. However, treatment for people with PS 2 without a targetable mutation remains unclear. Historically, people with a PS 2 cancer are frequently excluded from (important) clinical trials because of poorer outcomes and increased toxicity. We aim to address this knowledge gap, as this group of people represents a significant proportion (20% to 30%) of the total population with newly diagnosed lung cancer.
To identify the best first-line therapy for advanced lung cancer in people with performance status 2 without a targetable mutation or with an unknown mutation status.
We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. 
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared different chemotherapy (with or without angiogenesis inhibitor) or immunotherapy regimens, specifically designed for people with PS 2 only or studies including a subgroup of these people.
We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. overall survival (OS), 2. health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and 3. toxicity/adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were 4. tumor response rate, 5. progression-free survival, and 6. survival rates at six and 12 months' treatment. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence for each outcome.
We included 22 trials in this review and identified one ongoing trial. Twenty studies compared chemotherapy with different regimens, of which 11 compared non-platinum therapy (monotherapy or doublet) versus platinum doublet. We found no studies comparing best supportive care with chemotherapy and only two abstracts analyzing chemotherapy versus immunotherapy. We found that platinum doublet therapy showed superior OS compared to non-platinum therapy (hazard ratio [HR] 0.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.57 to 0.78; 7 trials, 697 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There were no differences in six-month survival rates (risk ratio [RR] 1.00, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.41; 6 trials, 632 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), whereas 12-month survival rates were improved for treatment with platinum doublet therapy (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.87 to 0.97; 11 trials, 1567 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). PFS and tumor response rate were also better for people treated with platinum doublet therapy, with moderate-certainty evidence (PFS: HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.77; 5 trials, 487 participants; tumor response rate: RR 2.25, 95% CI 1.67 to 3.05; 9 trials, 964 participants). When analyzing toxicity rates, we found that platinum doublet therapy increased grade 3 to 5 hematologic toxicities, all with low-certainty evidence (anemia: RR 1.98, 95% CI 1.00 to 3.92; neutropenia: RR 2.75, 95% CI 1.30 to 5.82; thrombocytopenia: RR 3.96, 95% CI 1.73 to 9.06; all 8 trials, 935 participants). Only four trials reported HRQoL data; however, the methodology was different per trial and we were unable to perform a meta-analysis. Although evidence is limited, there were no differences in 12-month survival rates or tumor response rates between carboplatin and cisplatin regimens. With an indirect comparison, carboplatin seemed to have better 12-month survival rates than cisplatin compared to non-platinum therapy. The assessment of the efficacy of immunotherapy in people with PS 2 was limited. There might be a place for single-agent immunotherapy, but the data provided by the included studies did not encourage the use of double-agent immunotherapy.
This review showed that as a first-line treatment for people with PS 2 with advanced NSCLC, platinum doublet therapy seems to be preferred over non-platinum therapy, with a higher response rate, PFS, and OS. Although the risk for grade 3 to 5 hematologic toxicity is higher, these events are often relatively mild and easy to treat. Since trials using checkpoint inhibitors in people with PS 2 are scarce, we identified an important knowledge gap regarding their role in people with advanced NSCLC and PS 2.","Lung cancer is the most frequent cause of cancer-related death worldwide and NSCLC is the most common subtype. At the time of diagnosis, the disease has already spread in more than half of all cases. In the tumors of a minority of people diagnosed with NSCLC that has spread to other parts of the body specific mutations can be found, which are treated distinct from the majority of people without such mutations.
NSCLC can only be treated with life-prolonging medicines such as chemotherapy (a medicine used to destroy cancer cells) or immunotherapy (a medicine that boosts the person's immune system and helps the body find and destroy cancer cells). Selecting the best treatment depends on the health condition of the person. That condition is determined using a scale from 0 (no symptoms) to 5 (dead). There is no discussion on the treatment of relatively fit people (scoring 0 or 1), as they often tolerate these treatments relatively well. People with a low health condition (scoring 3 or 4) receive only supportive care in most cases. However, although representing 20% to 30% of all people, the best treatment for moderately impaired people (PS 2) is not clear, as they often do not participate in trials.
Our objective was to investigate the best therapy for people with advanced NSCLC without a specific mutation with PS 2.
We searched medical databases for clinical trials comparing treatments for advanced NSCLC with best supportive care or other treatments.
We found 22 trials; 20 compared different types of chemotherapy and two compared chemotherapy versus immunotherapy.
People treated with chemotherapy regimens using two medicines, including a platinum-based medicine, had longer survival than people treated with chemotherapies without a platinum-based medicine. However, these people did have more side effects, especially with a negative influence on the bone marrow (matter found in the center of bones), resulting in a temporary lack of red and white blood cells, and platelets. The few studies that analyzed health-related quality of life all used different methods of measurement. We found no difference in quality of life when we looked at those studies individually. We found two partly published trials studying immunotherapy, which found no survival benefit compared to chemotherapy.
We are moderately confident in our results that chemotherapies with a platinum-based medicine increases survival. We are also moderately confident in the evidence evaluating the time to progression of disease because in all included studies, both investigators and trial participants were fully aware of which treatment the participants received. This might lead to substantial bias. In addition, we have little confidence in the evidence regarding toxicities because the evidence is based on a small number of studies with conflicting outcomes.",1023,non-small cell lung cancer; performance status; targetable mutation; immunotherapy regimens; overall survival; health-related quality of life; progression-free survival; tumor response rate; platinum doublet therapy; hematologic toxicities,What are the underlying motivations for focusing on people with performance status 2 in the study of NSCLC treatments?,How did the study distinguish between the effects of platinum-based chemotherapy versus non-platinum regimens?,Select the items that are animals,Critique the robustness of the studyÃ¢ÂÂs conclusions regarding immunotherapy for PS 2 patients.,What is the primary aim of the study discussed in the plain-language summary?,"They often tolerate treatment well, similar to those with PS 0 or 1.; They represent a significant but often neglected portion of NSCLC cases.; They are frequently included in clinical trials, which simplifies research.",They represent a significant but often neglected portion of NSCLC cases.,It demonstrated improved survival outcomes with platinum-based regimens.; It showed no difference in tumor response rates.; It highlighted consistent quality of life improvements with non-platinum regimens.,It demonstrated improved survival outcomes with platinum-based regimens.,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,The study robustly proves the superiority of immunotherapy over chemotherapy.; The evidence for the efficacy of immunotherapy was limited.; The study found clear benefits of double-agent immunotherapy.,The evidence for the efficacy of immunotherapy was limited.,To find the best therapy for people with PS 2 in advanced NSCLC without a specific mutation; To develop a new platinum-based chemotherapy drug; To compare supportive care with chemotherapy,To find the best therapy for people with PS 2 in advanced NSCLC without a specific mutation
5db48b4d14dab8000de45fdf,static_1,Ezetimibe for the prevention of heart disease and death,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains an important cause of mortality and morbidity, and high levels of blood cholesterol are thought to be the major modifiable risk factors for CVD. The use of statins is the preferred treatment strategy for the prevention of CVD, but some people at high-risk for CVD are intolerant to statin therapy or unable to achieve their treatment goals with the maximal recommended doses of statin. Ezetimibe is a selective cholesterol absorption inhibitor, whether it has a positive effect on CVD events remains uncertain. Results from clinical studies are inconsistent and a thorough evaluation of its efficacy and safety for the prevention of CVD and mortality is necessary.
To assess the efficacy and safety of ezetimibe for the prevention of CVD and all-cause mortality.
We searched the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and Web of Science on 27 June 2018, and two clinical trial registry platforms on 11 July 2018. We checked reference lists from primary studies and review articles for additional studies. No language restrictions were applied.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared ezetimibe versus placebo or ezetimibe plus other lipid-modifying drugs versus other lipid-modifying drugs alone in adults, with or without CVD, and which had a follow-up of at least 12 months.
Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, assessed risk of bias and contacted trialists to obtain missing data. We performed statistical analyses according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and used the GRADE to assess the quality of evidence.
We included 26 RCTs randomising 23,499 participants. All included studies assessed effects of ezetimibe plus other lipid-modifying drugs compared with other lipid-modifying drugs alone or plus placebo. Our findings were driven by the largest study (IMPROVE-IT), which had weights ranging from 41.5% to 98.4% in the different meta-analyses. Ezetimibe with statins probably reduces the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events compared with statins alone (risk ratio (RR) 0.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90 to 0.98; a decrease from 284/1000 to 267/1000, 95% CI 256 to 278; 21,727 participants; 10 studies; moderate-quality evidence). Trials reporting all-cause mortality used ezetimibe with statin or fenofibrate and found they have little or no effect on this outcome (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.05; 21,222 participants; 8 studies; high-quality evidence). Adding ezetimibe to statins probably reduces the risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.95; a decrease from 105/1000 to 92/1000, 95% CI 85 to 100; 21,145 participants; 6 studies; moderate-quality evidence) and non-fatal stroke (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.97; a decrease 32/1000 to 27/1000, 95% CI 23 to 31; 21,205 participants; 6 studies; moderate-quality evidence). Trials reporting cardiovascular mortality added ezetimibe to statin or fenofibrate, probably having little or no effect on this outcome (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.12; 19457 participants; 6 studies; moderate-quality evidence). The need for coronary revascularisation might be reduced by adding ezetimibe to statin (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.89 to 0.99; a decrease from 196/1000 to 184/1000, 95% 175 to 194; 21,323 participants; 7 studies); however, no difference in coronary revascularisation rate was observed when a sensitivity analysis was limited to studies with a low risk of bias. In terms of safety, adding ezetimibe to statins may make little or no difference in the risk of hepatopathy (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.35; 20,687 participants; 4 studies; low-quality evidence). It is uncertain whether ezetimibe increase or decrease the risk of myopathy (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.72 to 2.38; 20,581 participants; 3 studies; very low-quality evidence) and rhabdomyolysis, given the wide CIs and low event rate. Little or no difference in the risk of cancer, gallbladder-related disease and discontinuation due to adverse events were observed between treatment groups. For serum lipids, adding ezetimibe to statin or fenofibrate might further reduce the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol and triglyceride levels and likely increase the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels; however, substantial heterogeneity was detected in most analyses. None of the included studies reported on health-related quality of life.
Moderate- to high-quality evidence suggests that ezetimibe has modest beneficial effects on the risk of CVD endpoints, primarily driven by a reduction in non-fatal MI and non-fatal stroke, but it has little or no effect on clinical fatal endpoints. The cardiovascular benefit of ezetimibe might involve the reduction of LDL-C, total cholesterol and triglycerides. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether ezetimibe increases the risk of adverse events due to the low and very low quality of the evidence. The evidence for beneficial effects was mainly obtained from individuals with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD, predominantly with acute coronary syndrome) administered ezetimibe plus statins. However, there is limited evidence regarding the role of ezetimibe in primary prevention and the effects of ezetimibe monotherapy in the prevention of CVD, and these topics thus requires further investigation.","Is taking ezetimibe safe and does it prevent heart disease and death? Heart disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, and controlling lipid levels is one of the most effective strategies for preventing heart disease. The use of statins is the preferred treatment strategy for the prevention of heart disease, but some people at high risk of heart disease are intolerant to statins or with a poor response to statin therapy. Ezetimibe is a non-statin drug that can reduce the blood lipids levels by inhibiting cholesterol absorption, but whether it has beneficial effects on heart disease and death remains uncertain. This evidence is current up to July 2018. We included 26 studies involving 23,499 participants. These studies assessed the effects of ezetimibe plus other lipid-lowering drugs versus lipid-lowering drugs alone for heart disease. The participants were adults, and most of them had been diagnosed with coronary heart disease. Ezetimibe with statins probably reduces the risk for combined outcome of death due to heart disease, heart attack or stroke, but the benefit is moderate. However, adding ezetimibe to statin or fenofibrate have little or no effect on death from any cause. Treatment with ezetimibe and statin probably reduces the risk for non-fatal heart attacks and non-fatal stroke. Adding ezetimibe to statin or fenofibrate probably have little or no effect on heart-related death. Ezetimibe with statins might reduce the need for coronary revascularisation (the restoration of an adequate blood supply to the heart) by means of surgery. In terms of safety, we do not have enough evidence to know whether ezetimibe increases or decreases side-effects (e.g. liver injury, muscle pain, cancer, gallbladder-related disease and discontinuation). The analysis of blood lipids revealed that the addition of ezetimibe statin or fenofibrate therapy might further reduce the levels of blood lipids, including low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ('bad' cholesterol), total cholesterol and triglycerides, and likely increased the level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ('good' cholesterol). None of the included studies reported on health-related quality of life.

5db48b4d14dab8000de45fdf,static_2,Medicines to prevent breast cancer in women at above-average risk of developing breast cancer,"Breast cancer is the most frequently occurring malignancy and the second cause of death for cancer in women. Cancer prevention agents (CPAs) are a promising approach to reduce the burden of breast cancer. Currently, two main types of CPAs are available: selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs, such as tamoxifen and raloxifene) and aromatase inhibitors (AIs, such as exemestane and anastrozole).
To assess the efficacy and acceptability of single CPAs for the prevention of primary breast cancer, in unaffected women, at an above-average risk of developing breast cancer. Using a network meta-analysis, to rank single CPAs, based on their efficacy and acceptability (an endpoint that is defined as the inverse of CPA-related toxicity).
We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), and ClinicalTrials.gov on 17 August 2018. We handsearched reference lists to identify additional relevant studies.
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that enrolled women without a personal history of breast cancer but with an above-average risk of developing a tumor. Women had to be treated with a CPA and followed up to record the occurrence of breast cancer and adverse events.
Two review authors independently extracted data and conducted risk of bias assessments of the included studies, and assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. Outcome data included incidence of breast carcinoma (both invasive and in situ carcinoma) and adverse events (both overall and severe toxicity). We performed a conventional meta-analysis (for direct comparisons of a single CPA with placebo or a different CPA) and network meta-analysis (for indirect comparisons).
We included six studies enrolling 50,927 women randomized to receive one CPA (SERMs: tamoxifen or raloxifene, or AIs: exemestane or anastrozole) or placebo. Three studies compared tamoxifen and placebo, two studies compared AIs (exemestane or anastrozole) versus placebo, and one study compared tamoxifen versus raloxifene. The risk of bias was low for all RCTs. For the tamoxifen versus placebo comparison, tamoxifen likely resulted in a lower risk of developing breast cancer compared to placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 0.76; 3 studies, 22,832 women; moderate-certainty evidence). In terms of adverse events, tamoxifen likely increased the risk of severe toxicity compared to placebo (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.47; 2 studies, 20,361 women; moderate-certainty evidence). In particular, women randomized to receive tamoxifen experienced a higher incidence of both endometrial carcinoma (RR 2.26, 95% CI 1.52 to 3.38; high-certainty evidence) and thromboembolism (RR 2.10, 95% CI 1.14 to 3.89; high-certainty evidence) compared to women who received placebo. For the AIs versus placebo comparison, AIs (exemestane or anastrozole) reduced the risk of breast cancer by 53% (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.63; 2 studies, 8424 women; high-certainty evidence). In terms of adverse events, AIs increased the risk of severe toxicity by 18% (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.28; 2 studies, 8352 women; high-certainty evidence). These differences were sustained especially by endocrine (e.g. hot flashes), gastrointestinal (e.g. diarrhea), and musculoskeletal (e.g. arthralgia) adverse events, while there were no differences in endometrial cancer or thromboembolism rates between AIs and placebo. For the tamoxifen versus raloxifene comparison, raloxifene probably performed worse than tamoxifen in terms of breast cancer incidence reduction (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.43; 1 study, 19,490 women; moderate-certainty evidence), but its use was associated with lower toxicity rates (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.95; 1 study, 19,490 women; moderate-certainty evidence), particularly relating to incidence of endometrial cancer and thromboembolism. An indirect comparison of treatment effects allowed us to compare the SERMs and AIs in this review. In terms of efficacy, AIs (exemestane or anastrozole) may have reduced breast cancer incidence slightly compared to tamoxifen (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.98; 5 RCTs, 31,256 women); however, the certainty of evidence was low. A lack of model convergence did not allow us to analyze toxicity data.
For women with an above-average risk of developing breast cancer, CPAs can reduce the incidence of this disease. AIs appear to be more effective than SERMs (tamoxifen) in reducing the risk of developing breast cancer. AIs are not associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer and thromboembolic events. However, long-term data on toxicities from tamoxifen are available while the follow-up toxicity data on unaffected women taking AIs is relatively short. Additional data from direct comparisons are needed to fully address the issues of breast cancer prevention by risk-reducing medications, with special regards to acceptability (i.e. the benefit/harm ratio).","Breast cancer is the most frequent type of cancer and the second cause of death by cancer in women. Therefore, any strategy which can reduce its burden is eagerly awaited. Cancer prevention agents (CPAs) are medicines that might fulfil this need. Currently, two main types of CPAs are available to combat breast cancer: selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs, such as tamoxifen and raloxifene) and aromatase inhibitors (such as exemestane and anastrozole). Women without personal history of breast cancer, but with above-average risk of developing this disease (that is, with a lifetime risk greater than 17%) represent the usual target population for CPAs.
This Cochrane Review aimed to summarize the evidence on the efficacy and toxicity of CPAs for the prevention of primary breast cancer.
The review authors found six studies enrolling 50,927 women to receive one CPA or placebo (a pretend treatment, e.g. a sugar pill). Three studies involving 23,013 women compared tamoxifen and placebo, two studies involving 8424 women compared aromatase inhibitors (exemestane or anastrozole) and placebo, and one study involving 19,490 women that compared tamoxifen and raloxifene.
Based on the three studies that compared tamoxifen to placebo, tamoxifen probably reduced the risk of developing breast cancer by 32% compared to placebo. However, tamoxifen was associated with a 28% increased risk of severe side effects compared to placebo based on two studies involving 20,361 women. In particular, women taking tamoxifen experienced higher incidence of endometrial cancer and thromboembolism than women having no medicine.
For women who received either an aromatase inhibitor (exemestane or anastrozole) or placebo, aromatase inhibitors reduced the risk of breast cancer by 53% compared to placebo. Data from two studies involving 8352 women indicated that aromatase inhibitors increased the risk of severe side effects by 18% compared to placebo. These differences were sustained especially by endocrine (hormonal; e.g. hot flashes), gastrointestinal (e.g. diarrhea), and musculoskeletal (e.g. joint pain) side effects, whereas there were no differences in either endometrial cancer or thromboembolism rates.
For women who received either tamoxifen or raloxifene, raloxifene probably performed worse than tamoxifen in terms of breast cancer incidence reduction, but its use was associated with a 13% reduction of toxicity rates especially endometrial cancer and thromboembolism.
A specialized method named a 'network meta-analysis' allowed us to compare medications never directly compared to each other in a study. Based on this network meta-analysis, aromatase inhibitors may have led to a 23% additional risk reduction of developing breast cancer compared to tamoxifen. However, the reliability of the evidence was low meaning that further research is likely to have an impact on our confidence in this result.

5db48b4d14dab8000de45fdf,static_2,What are the benefits and risks of eye drops that widen the pupil as an additional treatment for inflammation after a blow to the eye?,"Traumatic eye complaints account for 3% of all hospital emergency department visits. The most common traumatic injury to the eye is blunt trauma, which accounts for 30% of these visits. Blunt trauma frequently leads to traumatic iridocyclitis, thus causing anterior uveitis. Iridocyclitis frequently causes tearing, photophobia, eye pain, and vision loss. These symptoms are a result of the inflammatory processes and ciliary spasms to iris muscles and sphincter. The inflammatory process is usually managed with topical corticosteroids, while the ciliary spasm is blunted by dilating the pupils with topical mydriatic agents, an adjuvant therapy. However, the effectiveness of mydriatic agents has not been quantified in terms of reduction of ocular pain and visual acuity loss.
To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of topical mydriatics as adjunctive therapy to topical corticosteroids for traumatic iridocyclitis.
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register (2019, issue 6); Ovid MEDLINE; Embase.com; Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) Plus; PubMed; ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic search for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 12 June 2019.
We planned to include randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared topical mydriatic agents in conjunction with topical corticosteroid therapy versus topical corticosteroids alone, in participants with traumatic iridocyclitis.
Two review authors (JH, MK) independently screened titles and abstracts, then full-text reports, against eligibility criteria. We planned to have two authors independently extract data from included studies. We resolved differences in opinion by discussion.
There were no eligible RCTs that compared the interventions of interest in people with traumatic iridocyclitis.
We did not find any evidence from RCTs about the efficacy of topical mydriatic agents as an adjunctive therapy with topical corticosteroids for treating traumatic iridocyclitis. In the absence of these types of studies, we cannot draw any firm conclusions. Controlled trials that compare the combined use of topical mydriatic agents and corticosteroid drops against standard corticosteroid drops alone, in people with traumatic iridocyclitis are required. These may provide evidence about the efficacy and risk of topical mydriatic drops as adjuvant therapy for traumatic iridocyclitis.","Hospital emergency departments often treat people with eye injuries. There are two main types of eye injuries: blunt trauma injuries, when an object or force strikes the eye, commonly caused by motor vehicle accidents, sports- or work-related accidents, or fights; and penetrating trauma injuries, when a sharp object or an object traveling at high speed (for example, pellets from air-powered guns) pierces the eye. Blunt trauma is the more common type of injury. People who experience these injuries often develop traumatic iridocyclitis, an inflammation of the iris (the colored part of the eye surrounding the pupil) and the ciliary body (the muscles and tissues around the iris). Traumatic iridocyclitis can develop after both major and minor blunt trauma and can affect both children and adults. Symptoms include eye pain and sensitivity to light. If the inflammation is missed or not treated properly, it can lead to vision loss. The standard treatment for traumatic iridocyclitis is anti-inflammatory eye drops (corticosteroids). Eye drops that widen the pupil (mydriatics) are often added to reduce pain and discomfort and to shorten the duration of symptoms. We aimed to determine whether using mydriatics alongside corticosteroids is more beneficial or causes more unwanted effects than using corticosteroids alone. Specifically, we wanted to know if mydriatics relieve pain and inflammation and improve vision, and whether they cause complications such as chronic pain or serious harm to vision, including blindness. Our team searched the medical literature for randomized controlled trials the most reliable type of study on people of any age with traumatic iridocyclitis that compared mydriatics plus corticosteroids against corticosteroids alone. We found no randomized controlled trials addressing this question. Therefore, we do not know whether adding mydriatics to corticosteroids is helpful or harmful compared with corticosteroids alone. More research is needed, including well-designed trials, to understand the benefits and risks of using mydriatics as an additional treatment for traumatic iridocyclitis.",1053,Topical mydriatic agents; Topical corticosteroids; Traumatic iridocyclitis; Blunt trauma; Anterior uveitis; Ciliary spasms; Photophobia; Inflammatory processes; Adjunctive therapy; Ocular pain,How might the lack of randomized controlled trials affect the implementation of mydriatic agents in clinical practice for traumatic iridocyclitis?,What is the intended benefit of adding mydriatics to corticosteroid treatment for traumatic iridocyclitis?,Select the items that are animals,Describe the condition known as traumatic iridocyclitis.,What standard treatment is used for traumatic iridocyclitis?,"Clinicians may hesitate to use mydriatics due to unclear benefits and risks.; Clinicians can confidently prescribe mydriatics, assuming they're safe.; Clinicians should replace corticosteroids with mydriatics alone.",Clinicians may hesitate to use mydriatics due to unclear benefits and risks.,To relieve pain and improve vision; To reduce allergic reactions; To prevent infection,To relieve pain and improve vision,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,An inflammation of the iris and ciliary body; A breakdown of the retina; A swelling of the cornea,An inflammation of the iris and ciliary body,Anti-inflammatory eye drops (corticosteroids); Antibiotic ointments; Laser eye surgery,Anti-inflammatory eye drops (corticosteroids)
5db48b4d14dab8000de45fdf,interactive_3,Interventions to prevent asthma attacks in children upon return to school in the autumn,"Asthma exacerbations in school-aged children peak in autumn shortly after they return to school, likely due to factors such as poor treatment adherence, increased allergen and viral exposure, and changes in immune tolerance. Because this seasonal peak is predictable occurring in September in the Northern Hemisphere and February in the Southern Hemisphere targeted interventions may help reduce exacerbations and lessen the strain on health services. This review assessed the effects of pharmacological and behavioural interventions implemented before school return to reduce autumn asthma exacerbations in children. We searched major trial registries and databases up to 1 December 2017, with no language restrictions. We included randomised controlled trials comparing pre-autumn interventions with usual care in children aged 18 years or younger. Standard Cochrane methods were used for study selection, data extraction, and bias assessment. The primary outcome was the proportion of children experiencing an asthma exacerbation requiring hospitalisation or oral corticosteroids during autumn. Of 546 trials screened, five met the inclusion criteria, enrolling 14,252 children. All studies were conducted in the Northern Hemisphere. Three interventions used leukotriene receptor antagonists, one used omalizumab or an inhaled corticosteroid boost, and the largest study (12,179 children) used a medication reminder letter. Although individual studies generally had low risk of bias, the evidence quality was downgraded due to imprecision, inconsistency, and indirect outcome measurement. Only one US study involving 513 children with asthma and allergic sensitisation reported data for the primary outcome. In this study, exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids or hospitalisation within 90 days of school return were reduced to 11.3% in the omalizumab group compared with 21.0% in the placebo group. The other studies used different exacerbation definitions. A pooled analysis of two leukotriene receptor antagonist trials found no effect on exacerbations, and the reminder-letter intervention did not reduce unscheduled respiratory healthcare contacts between September and December. Four studies reported adverse events, with no evidence of differences between intervention and usual care groups. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were not possible due to insufficient data. Seasonal omalizumab treatment starting four to six weeks before school return may reduce autumn asthma exacerbations, with no increase in adverse effects aside from injection site pain, although the treatment is costly. There was no evidence regarding effects on asthma control, quality of life, or mortality. Future trials should clearly define exacerbations, standardise outcome measures, and carefully characterise participants to allow analysis of subgroup effects.","Asthma is a long-term condition affecting the lungs. It is the most common long-term condition affecting children. One in 11 children in the United Kingdom have asthma. People with asthma can experience asthma 'attacks' of coughing, wheezing, and difficulty breathing. Each year there is a peak in asthma attacks after school restarts in autumn. The likely reason for this is that children are exposed to more viruses that can trigger asthma. Children may also have taken their regular medication less consistently with the break in routine over the summer. As this increase in attacks at the start of the school year is predictable, and the reason for it is somewhat understood, it might be preventable. Approaches to reducing autumn asthma attacks include using extra medications when school restarts or medication reminders during the school holiday. Our searches found 546 trials, of which five were relevant. In total, 14,252 children were randomly assigned to receive either an intervention targeting autumn asthma attacks or usual care. Four small studies (approximately 200 to 1200 children in each) gave children extra asthma medication; these additional medications were omalizumab, leukotriene receptor antagonist tablets, or increased doses of inhaled steroids. One study sent a medication reminder letter over the summer holidays to parents of children with asthma. One trial gave children either omalizumab or placebo. Omalizumab is an antibody designed to alter the immune response. It was given by injection regularly over four to six weeks before school return (i.e. over the bulk of the summer holidays). The children in this study had known allergic asthma. The study showed that omalizumab might reduce autumn attacks. Eleven per cent of those receiving omalizumab had an asthma attack during the first 90 days compared to 21% of those receiving placebo. Three studies used leukotriene receptor antagonist tablets, either montelukast or pranlukast. Although the results of one study suggested that seasonal montelukast might reduce autumn attacks, there was no evidence of reduced attacks in the other two later trials, including a second larger trial of montelukast. There was no evidence that sending a reminder letter reduces the number of children requiring an unplanned healthcare contact. No study provided evidence that the total number of children experiencing adverse events was greater in the intervention than in the usual care group. Our findings were limited by the small numbers of studies identified and because these studies used different interventions and definitions of asthma exacerbations. Further research is needed to better understand how to prevent seasonal attacks, including interventions suitable for children with mild asthma, where expensive and painful treatments are not justified.",1078,asthma exacerbations; allergic sensitisation; leukotriene receptor antagonists; omalizumab; inhaled corticosteroid boost; oral corticosteroids; placebo group; unscheduled respiratory healthcare contacts; adverse events; asthma control,How do the various interventions compare in their effectiveness to reduce autumn asthma attacks?,What was the primary purpose of the study discussed in the summary?,Select all of the following that are fruits,How did the seasonal omalizumab treatment affect asthma exacerbations in the study?,What problem is associated with the increase of asthma attacks in autumn?,Omalizumab proved more effective than leukotriene receptor antagonists.; The medication reminder letter showed the highest reduction in attacks.; All interventions showed equal effectiveness.,Omalizumab proved more effective than leukotriene receptor antagonists.,To assess the effects of pre-autumn interventions on asthma exacerbations in children.; To find new medications for asthma treatment.; To study summer activities of children with asthma.,To assess the effects of pre-autumn interventions on asthma exacerbations in children.,dog; blue; grape,grape,Reduced exacerbations by 11%; Reduced exacerbations to 11% of occurrences; Increased exacerbations by 21%,Reduced exacerbations to 11% of occurrences,Increased contact with triggers such as viruses; Children change their class schedules; Decrease in temperatures leading to cold symptoms,Increased contact with triggers such as viruses
5db48b4d14dab8000de45fdf,interactive_4,Glucagon-like peptide analogues for type 2 diabetes,"Glucagon-like peptide analogues are a new class of drugs used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes that mimic the endogenous hormone glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1). GLP-1 is an incretin, a gastrointestinal hormone that is released into the circulation in response to ingested nutrients. GLP-1 regulates glucose levels by stimulating glucose-dependent insulin secretion and biosynthesis, and by suppressing glucagon secretion, delayed gastric emptying and promoting satiety.
To assess the effects of glucagon-like peptide analogues in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Studies were obtained from electronic searches of The Cochrane Library (last search issue 1, 2011), MEDLINE (last search March 2011), EMBASE (last search March 2011), Web of Science (last search March 2011) and databases of ongoing trials.
Studies were included if they were randomised controlled trials of a minimum duration of eight weeks comparing a GLP-1 analogue with placebo, insulin, an oral anti-diabetic agent, or another GLP-1 analogue in people with type 2 diabetes.
Data extraction and quality assessment of studies were done by one reviewer and checked by a second. Data were analysed by type of GLP-1 agonist and comparison treatment. Where appropriate, data were summarised in a meta-analysis (mean differences and risk ratios summarised using a random-effects model).
Seventeen randomised controlled trials including relevant analyses for 6899 participants were included in the analysis. Studies were mostly of short duration, usually 26 weeks. In comparison with placebo, all GLP-1 agonists reduced glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels by about 1%. Exenatide 2 mg once weekly and liraglutide 1.8 mg reduced it by 0.20% and 0.24% respectively more than insulin glargine. Exenatide 2 mg once weekly reduced HbA1c more than exenatide 10 ?g twice daily, sitagliptin and pioglitazone. Liraglutide 1.8 mg reduced HbA1c by 0.33% more than exenatide 10 ?g twice daily. Liraglutide led to similar improvements in HbA1c compared to sulphonylureas but reduced it more than sitagliptin and rosiglitazone. Both exenatide and liraglutide led to greater weight loss than most active comparators, including in participants not experiencing nausea. Hypoglycaemia occurred more frequently in participants taking concomitant sulphonylurea. GLP-1 agonists caused gastrointestinal adverse effects, mainly nausea. These adverse events were strongest at the beginning and then subsided. Beta-cell function was improved with GLP-1 agonists but the effect did not persist after cessation of treatment. None of the studies was long enough to assess long-term positive or negative effects.
GLP-1 agonists are effective in improving glycaemic control.","Glucagon-like peptide analogues or agonists are a new kind of drug in the treatment of type 2 diabetes that are given by injection under the skin. They regulate glucose levels by stimulating glucose-dependent insulin secretion and biosynthesis, and by suppressing glucagon secretion, delaying gastric emptying and promoting satiety. Various glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists are in use or in the licensing process, including exenatide, liraglutide, albiglutide, taspoglutide, lixisenatide and LY2189265.
Seventeen randomised controlled trials of mostly moderate to high quality randomised approximately 6899 people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Studies were mostly of short duration, usually 26 weeks. The longest duration study was 30 weeks. Of the seventeen studies, one compared albiglutide with placebo, two compared exenatide 10µg twice daily against exenatide 2 mg once weekly, one compared exenatide 2 mg once weekly against insulin glargine, one compared exenatide 2 mg once weekly against pioglitazone and sitagliptin, five compared liraglutide with placebo, two compared liraglutide with sulphonylurea, one each compared exenatide twice daily with liraglutide, liraglutide with sitagliptin, liraglutide with rosiglitazone and liraglutide with insulin glargine, two compared taspoglutide with placebo and one each compared lixisenatide with placebo and LY2189265 with placebo. In people already treated with oral anti-diabetes drugs, addition of glucagon-like peptide analogues improved blood sugar control in comparison to placebo, rosiglitazone, pioglitazone or sitagliptin, but not always in comparison to insulin (for exenatide) or glimepiride (a sulphonylurea). Glucagon-like peptide analogous caused more weight loss than any of the comparison treatments. However, more nausea and other gastrointestinal effects such as diarrhoea or vomiting were seen, though these tended to wear off and were not seen in all participants. There was slightly more hypoglycaemia with glucagon-like analogous than with placebo, but generally less than with other anti-diabetic treatments. The incidence of hypoglycaemia occurred more frequently in participants taking concomitant sulphonylurea. The studies were not long enough to assess long-term side effects.

5db48b4d14dab8000de45fdf,interactive_4,"Pharmacological, non-invasive brain stimulation and psychological interventions for treating depression after stroke","Depression is an important morbidity associated with stroke that impacts on recovery, yet is often undetected or inadequately treated. This review aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of pharmacological intervention, non-invasive brain stimulation, psychological therapy, or combinations of these to treat depression after stroke. This is a living systematic review, and we search for new evidence every two months and update the review when we identify relevant new evidence; we searched the Specialised Registers of Cochrane Stroke and Cochrane Depression Anxiety and Neurosis, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, five other databases, two clinical trials registers, reference lists and conference proceedings (February 2022), and contacted study authors. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were eligible if they compared pharmacological interventions with placebo; non-invasive brain stimulation with sham stimulation or usual care; psychological therapy with usual care or attention control; pharmacological intervention and psychological therapy with pharmacological intervention and usual care or attention control; pharmacological intervention and non-invasive brain stimulation with pharmacological intervention and sham stimulation or usual care; non-invasive brain stimulation and psychological therapy versus sham brain stimulation or usual care and psychological therapy; pharmacological intervention and psychological therapy with placebo and psychological therapy; pharmacological intervention and non-invasive brain stimulation with placebo and non-invasive brain stimulation; and non-invasive brain stimulation and psychological therapy versus non-invasive brain stimulation and usual care or attention control, with the intention of treating depression after stroke. Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data; we calculated mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous data and risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous data with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), assessed heterogeneity using the I² statistic, and evaluated certainty of evidence according to GRADE. We included 65 trials (72 comparisons) with 5831 participants, with data available for 20 comparisons involving pharmacological interventions, nine for non-invasive brain stimulation, 25 for psychological therapy, three for pharmacological plus psychological therapy, 14 for pharmacological plus non-invasive brain stimulation, and one for non-invasive brain stimulation plus psychological therapy, and no trials for three other comparisons. For pharmacological interventions, very low-certainty evidence from eight trials suggests decreased numbers of people meeting study criteria for depression (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.88; 8 RCTs; 1025 participants) and decreased inadequate response to treatment (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.70; 6 RCTs; 511 participants) compared to placebo, but more adverse events related to the CNS (RR 1.55, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.15; 5 RCTs; 488 participants) and gastrointestinal system (RR 1.62, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.19; 4 RCTs; 473 participants) occurred with pharmacological intervention. For non-invasive brain stimulation, very low-certainty evidence from two trials showed little to no effect on depression or inadequate treatment response compared to sham stimulation. For psychological therapy, very low-certainty evidence from six trials suggests decreased depression prevalence (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.95; 521 participants) compared to usual care/attention control, with no differences in deaths or adverse events. For combined pharmacological and psychological therapy, no trials reported primary outcomes. For pharmacological intervention plus non-invasive brain stimulation, combination therapy reduced depression prevalence (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.91; 3 RCTs; 392 participants; low-certainty evidence) but did not reduce inadequate treatment response (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.30; 3 RCTs; 392 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and very low-certainty evidence from five trials suggested no difference in deaths. No primary outcomes were reported for non-invasive brain stimulation plus psychological therapy. Overall, very low-certainty evidence suggests that pharmacological, psychological, and combination therapies can reduce the prevalence of depression after stroke, while non-invasive brain stimulation has little to no effect, and pharmacological interventions were associated with CNS and gastrointestinal adverse events; more research is required before routine use of such treatments can be recommended.","Do pharmacological treatments, non-invasive brain stimulation (electrodes are placed on the scalp and a finely controlled electric current is applied to change brain activity), psychological treatments, or combination treatments reduce the proportion of people with depression or the extent of depressive symptoms after stroke? Depression is common after stroke yet often is not detected or is inadequately treated. We identified studies by searches conducted on 8 February 2022. This is a living systematic review. We search for new evidence every two months and update the review when we identify relevant new evidence. Please refer to the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for the current status of this review. We included trials that reported on the use of pharmacological, non-invasive brain stimulation, psychological, and combined interventions to treat depression after stroke. We described the main outcomes as the number of people meeting the criteria for depression (scoring above a predefined scoring threshold) and inadequate response (scoring below 50% of the predefined scoring threshold). Average age of participants ranged from 54 to 78 years. Studies were from Asia (39), Europe (12), America (6), South America (1) and Australia (3). We included 65 trials (72 comparisons) involving 5831 participants. Pharmacological treatments resulted in fewer people meeting the study criteria for depression at end of treatment and with inadequate response to treatment. Non-invasive brain stimulation did not reduce the number of people meeting the study criteria for depression at end of treatment and with inadequate response to treatment. Psychological therapy reduced the number of people meeting the study criteria for depression at end of treatment. The combination of pharmacological treatment and non-invasive brain stimulation resulted in fewer people meeting the study criteria for depression but did not affect those with inadequate response to treatment. More people in the pharmacological treatment group reported central nervous system (e.g. confusion, sedation, tremor; in five trials) and gastrointestinal side effects (e.g. constipation, diarrhoea; in four trials) than in the placebo groups. Information on side effects of other treatments was not provided. Estimates of treatment effects were imprecise due to small numbers in most studies and recruitment of people with very different baseline characteristics. We rated the certainty of evidence as low to very low due to these and other limitations in study design. Antidepressant drugs may benefit people with persistent depressive symptoms after stroke, but care is required in their use, as little is known about their effects on overall stroke recovery. Non-invasive brain stimulation may not be of benefit while psychological and combination therapies may offer a treatment option. Future research should include a broader group of people with stroke.",1117,Depression; stroke; pharmacological intervention; non-invasive brain stimulation; psychological therapy; usual care; adverse events,"In assessing the study's outcomes for psychological therapies, which factor stands out as needing more investigation?",What conclusions can be made about the role of non-invasive brain stimulation in treating depression after stroke?,Select all of the following that are colors,What was one of the main motivations for conducting this study?,What types of treatments did the study focus on?,Effectiveness across different ethnic populations.; Unified evaluation metrics for the therapy's efficacy.; Weight loss impacts as a side effect.,Effectiveness across different ethnic populations.; Unified evaluation metrics for the therapy's efficacy.,It is not effective in reducing depressive symptoms.; It consistently reduces the number of depressive cases.; Its effects and implications require further exploration.,It is not effective in reducing depressive symptoms.; Its effects and implications require further exploration.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Depression is often detected after a stroke.; Depression is an important morbidity associated with stroke that is often undetected or inadequately treated.; Stroke recovery is not affected by depression.,Depression is an important morbidity associated with stroke that is often undetected or inadequately treated.,"Pharmacological treatments, non-invasive brain stimulation, psychological therapy, and combination treatments.; Only non-invasive brain stimulation treatments.; Surgical interventions.","Pharmacological treatments, non-invasive brain stimulation, psychological therapy, and combination treatments."
5db48b4d14dab8000de45fdf,finetuned_5,Does taxation of unprocessed sugar or foods with added sugar reduce their consumption and prevent obesity or other adverse health outcomes?,"Global prevalence of overweight and obesity are alarming. For tackling this public health problem, preventive public health and policy actions are urgently needed. Some countries implemented food taxes in the past and some were subsequently abolished. Some countries, such as Norway, Hungary, Denmark, Bermuda, Dominica, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and the Navajo Nation (USA), specifically implemented taxes on unprocessed sugar and sugar-added foods. These taxes on unprocessed sugar and sugar-added foods are fiscal policy interventions, implemented to decrease their consumption and in turn reduce adverse health-related, economic and social effects associated with these food products. To assess the effects of taxation of unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods in the general population on the consumption of unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods, the prevalence and incidence of overweight and obesity, and the prevalence and incidence of other diet-related health outcomes. We searched CENTRAL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, Embase and 15 other databases and trials registers on 12 September 2019. We handsearched the reference list of all records of included studies, searched websites of international organisations and institutions, and contacted review advisory group members to identify planned, ongoing or unpublished studies. We included studies with the following populations: children (0 to 17 years) and adults (18 years or older) from any country and setting. Exclusion applied to studies with specific subgroups, such as people with any disease who were overweight or obese as a side-effect of the disease. The review included studies with taxes on or artificial increases of selling prices for unprocessed sugar or food products that contain added sugar (e.g. sweets, ice cream, confectionery, and bakery products), or both, as intervention, regardless of the taxation level or price increase. In line with Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) criteria, we included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-randomised controlled trials (cRCTs), non-randomised controlled trials (nRCTs), controlled before-after (CBA) studies, and interrupted time series (ITS) studies. We included controlled studies with more than one intervention or control site and ITS studies with a clearly defined intervention time and at least three data points before and three after the intervention. Our primary outcomes were consumption of unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods, energy intake, overweight, and obesity. Our secondary outcomes were substitution and diet, expenditure, demand, and other health outcomes. Two review authors independently screened all eligible records for inclusion, assessed the risk of bias, and performed data extraction.Two review authors independently assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We retrieved a total of 24,454 records. After deduplicating records, 18,767 records remained for title and abstract screening. Of 11 potentially relevant studies, we included one ITS study with 40,210 household-level observations from the Hungarian Household Budget and Living Conditions Survey. The baseline ranged from January 2008 to August 2011, the intervention was implemented on September 2011, and follow-up was until December 2012 (16 months). The intervention was a tax - the so-called 'Hungarian public health product tax' - on sugar-added foods, including selected foods exceeding a specific sugar threshold value. The intervention includes co-interventions: the taxation of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) and of foods high in salt or caffeine. The study provides evidence on the effect of taxing foods exceeding a specific sugar threshold value on the consumption of sugar-added foods. After implementation of the Hungarian public health product tax, the mean consumption of taxed sugar-added foods (measured in units of kg) decreased by 4.0% (standardised mean difference (SMD) ?0.040, 95% confidence interval (CI) ?0.07 to ?0.01; very low-certainty evidence). The study was at low risk of bias in terms of performance bias, detection bias and reporting bias, with the shape of effect pre-specified and the intervention unlikely to have any effect on data collection. The study was at unclear risk of attrition bias and at high risk in terms of other bias and the independence of the intervention. We rated the certainty of the evidence as very low for the primary and secondary outcomes. The Hungarian public health product tax included a tax on sugar-added foods but did not include a tax on unprocessed sugar. We did not find eligible studies reporting on the taxation of unprocessed sugar. No studies reported on the primary outcomes of consumption of unprocessed sugar, energy intake, overweight, and obesity. No studies reported on the secondary outcomes of substitution and diet, demand, and other health outcomes. No studies reported on differential effects across population subgroups. We could not perform meta-analyses or pool study results. There was very limited evidence and the certainty of the evidence was very low. Despite the reported reduction in consumption of taxed sugar-added foods, we are uncertain whether taxing unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods has an effect on reducing their consumption and preventing obesity or other adverse health outcomes. Further robustly conducted studies are required to draw concrete conclusions on the effectiveness of taxing unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods for reducing their consumption and preventing obesity or other adverse health outcomes.","As outlined by the World Health Organization, 'globesity' (the rise in overweight and obesity globally) is a major world challenge. A sugar-rich diet, especially when combined with physical inactivity, may cause overweight and obesity, and other harmful health outcomes. There are direct costs to healthcare services of people being overweight or obese, such as preventing and treating health problems that this causes. There are also costs to society as a whole when people who are ill through being overweight or obese are unable to work. This review may be of interest to government public health agencies, policy decision-makers, food retailers, and food industries. This review and subsequent updates of this review may change policy and affect a government's motivation to create a tax on unprocessed sugar and foods with added sugar. It also may motivate food industries to reformulate their products to contain lower levels of added sugar. We wanted to know if taxation of unprocessed sugar and foods with added sugar (other than sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs)) reduced their consumption, changed people's energy intake, and reduced overweight and obesity. We also wanted to know if taxation changed people's diet and spending, and had an effect on other diet-related health problems. We searched for ongoing or published studies up to October 2019. Of a total of 24,454 records retrieved, we identified one 'interrupted time series' (ITS) study meeting our eligibility criteria to assess the impact of a tax on sugar-added foods (but not unprocessed sugar). The study used data from the Hungarian Household Budget and Living Conditions Survey, with observations from 40,210 households. Evidence from the study included a 'baseline' (the situation before taxation), ranging from January 2008 to August 2011. The Hungarian public health product tax was implemented on September 2011. The duration of the follow-up period (measuring the effects of taxation) was 16 months. The study was funded by the Scottish Institute for Research in Economics (SIRE) Early Career Engagement Grant. The included study provided very limited evidence that taxing foods with added sugar reduced their consumption by 4%. We are very uncertain about this evidence because the study did not use the strongest methods, looked at other kinds of taxation as well as taxing foods with added sugar, and may not have correctly classified food types. We are uncertain whether taxing foods with added sugar has an effect on reducing their consumption. The included study did not investigate the effects of taxing unprocessed sugar. Further research is needed to assess the effectiveness of taxing unprocessed sugar or foods with added sugar for reducing their consumption and preventing obesity or other adverse health outcomes. Studies should take place in countries that have implemented these taxes and should look at cost-effectiveness as well as the health benefits of taxing unprocessed sugar or foods with added sugar as a public health policy for preventing overweight, obesity or other adverse health outcomes. Countries that have implemented these taxes are Bermuda, Dominica, Hungary, India, Norway, the Navajo Nation (USA), and St. Vincent and Grenadines.",1103,overweight and obesity; preventive public health; fiscal policy interventions; Hungarian public health product tax; sugar-sweetened beverages; very low-certainty evidence; consumption of sugar-added foods; prevalence and incidence; demand and other health outcomes,Evaluate the impact of sugar taxation on public health policy motivation.,What potential effects on food reformulation might result from this study's findings?,Select all of the following that are fruits,Analyze the reasons for including various countries with implemented sugar taxes in the study.,Judge the reliability of the study based on the methods used to assess sugar consumption reduction.,It may motivate policy changes to implement sugar taxes.; It provides conclusive evidence to halt all sugar taxes.; It discourages future research on sugar taxation policies.,It may motivate policy changes to implement sugar taxes.,Industries could reduce added sugar in products.; Industries might eliminate all sugar from products.; Industries will increase sugar content to boost sales.,Industries could reduce added sugar in products.,dog; blue; grape,grape,To provide a comprehensive review of international tax efficacy.; To identify global trends in sugar consumption reduction.; To facilitate the exploration of diverse tax-related health outcomes.,To facilitate the exploration of diverse tax-related health outcomes.,The methods used were robust and reliable.; The study lacked strong methods and classifications.; The reliability was high due to the large sample size.,The study lacked strong methods and classifications.
5db48b4d14dab8000de45fdf,finetuned_6,Telerehabilitation services for stroke,"Telerehabilitation offers an alternate way of delivering rehabilitation services. Information and communication technologies are used to facilitate communication between the healthcare professional and the patient in a remote location. The use of telerehabilitation is becoming more viable as the speed and sophistication of communication technologies improve. However, it is currently unclear how effective this model of delivery is relative to rehabilitation delivered face-to-face or when added to usual care.
To determine whether the use of telerehabilitation leads to improved ability to perform activities of daily living amongst stroke survivors when compared with (1) in-person rehabilitation (when the clinician and the patient are at the same physical location and rehabilitation is provided face-to-face); or (2) no rehabilitation or usual care. Secondary objectives were to determine whether use of telerehabilitation leads to greater independence in self-care and domestic life and improved mobility, balance, health-related quality of life, depression, upper limb function, cognitive function or functional communication when compared with in-person rehabilitation and no rehabilitation. Additionally, we aimed to report on the presence of adverse events, cost-effectiveness, feasibility and levels of user satisfaction associated with telerehabilitation interventions.
We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (June 2019), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (the Cochrane Library, Issue 6, 2019), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to June 2019), Embase (1974 to June 2019), and eight additional databases. We searched trial registries and reference lists.
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of telerehabilitation in stroke. We included studies that compared telerehabilitation with in-person rehabilitation or no rehabilitation. In addition, we synthesised and described the results of RCTs that compared two different methods of delivering telerehabilitation services without an alternative group. We included rehabilitation programmes that used a combination of telerehabilitation and in-person rehabilitation provided that the greater proportion of intervention was provided via telerehabilitation.
Two review authors independently identified trials on the basis of prespecified inclusion criteria, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. A third review author moderated any disagreements. The review authors contacted investigators to ask for missing information. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence and interpret findings.
We included 22 trials in the review involving a total of 1937 participants. The studies ranged in size from the inclusion of 10 participants to 536 participants, and reporting quality was often inadequate, particularly in relation to random sequence generation and allocation concealment. Selective outcome reporting and incomplete outcome data were apparent in several studies. Study interventions and comparisons varied, meaning that, in many cases, it was inappropriate to pool studies. Intervention approaches included post-hospital discharge support programs, upper limb training, lower limb and mobility retraining and communication therapy for people with post-stroke language disorders. Studies were either conducted upon discharge from hospital or with people in the subacute or chronic phases following stroke. Primary outcome: we found moderate-quality evidence that there was no difference in activities of daily living between people who received a post-hospital discharge telerehabilitation intervention and those who received usual care (based on 2 studies with 661 participants (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.15 to 0.15)). We found low-quality evidence of no difference in effects on activities of daily living between telerehabilitation and in-person physical therapy programmes (based on 2 studies with 75 participants: SMD 0.03, 95% CI -0.43 to 0.48). Secondary outcomes: we found a low quality of evidence that there was no difference between telerehabilitation and in-person rehabilitation for balance outcomes (based on 3 studies with 106 participants: SMD 0.08, 95%CI -0.30 to 0.46). Pooling of three studies with 569 participants showed moderate-quality evidence that there was no difference between those who received post-discharge support interventions and those who received usual care on health-related quality of life (SMD 0.03, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.20). Similarly, pooling of six studies (with 1145 participants) found moderate-quality evidence that there was no difference in depressive symptoms when comparing post-discharge tele-support programs with usual care (SMD -0.04, 95% CI -0.19 to 0.11). We found no difference between groups for upper limb function (based on 3 studies with 170 participants: mean difference (MD) 1.23, 95% CI -2.17 to 4.64, low-quality evidence) when a computer program was used to remotely retrain upper limb function in comparison to in-person therapy. Evidence was insufficient to draw conclusions on the effects of telerehabilitation on mobility or participant satisfaction with the intervention. No studies evaluated the cost-effectiveness of telerehabilitation; however, five of the studies reported health service utilisation outcomes or costs of the interventions provided within the study. Two studies reported on adverse events, although no serious trial-related adverse events were reported.
While there is now an increasing number of RCTs testing the efficacy of telerehabilitation, it is hard to draw conclusions about the effects as interventions and comparators varied greatly across studies. In addition, there were few adequately powered studies and several studies included in this review were at risk of bias. At this point, there is only low or moderate-level evidence testing whether telerehabilitation is a more effective or similarly effective way to provide rehabilitation. Short-term post-hospital discharge telerehabilitation programmes have not been shown to reduce depressive symptoms, improve quality of life, or improve independence in activities of daily living when compared with usual care. Studies comparing telerehabilitation and in-person therapy have also not found significantly different outcomes between groups, suggesting that telerehabilitation is not inferior. Some studies reported that telerehabilitation was less expensive to provide but information was lacking about cost-effectiveness. Only two trials reported on whether or not any adverse events had occurred; these trials found no serious adverse events were related to telerehabilitation. The field is still emerging and more studies are needed to draw more definitive conclusions. In addition, while this review examined the efficacy of telerehabilitation when tested in randomised trials, studies that use mixed methods to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of telehealth interventions are incredibly valuable in measuring outcomes.","This review aimed to gather evidence for the use of telerehabilitation after stroke. We aimed to compare telerehabilitation with therapy delivered face-to-face and with no therapy (usual care).
Stroke is a common cause of disability in adults. After a stroke, it is common for the individual to have difficulty managing everyday activities such as walking, showering, dressing, and participating in community activities. Many people need rehabilitation after stroke; this is usually provided by healthcare professionals in a hospital or clinic setting. Recent studies have investigated whether it is possible to use technologies such as the telephone or the Internet to help people communicate with healthcare professionals without having to leave their home. This approach, which is called telerehabilitation, may be a more convenient and less expensive way of providing rehabilitation. Telerehabilitation may be used to improve a range of outcomes including physical functioning and mood. We searched for studies in June 2019 and identified 22 studies involving 1937 people after stroke. The studies used a wide range of treatments, including therapy programmes designed to improve arm function and ability to walk and programmes designed to provide counselling and support for people upon leaving hospital after stroke. As the studies were very different, it was rarely appropriate to combine results to determine overall effect. We found that people who received telerehabilitation had similar outcomes for activities of daily living function to those that received face-to-face therapy and those that received no therapy (usual care). At this point, not enough research has been done to show whether telerehabilitation is a more effective way to provide rehabilitation. Some studies report that telerehabilitation is less expensive to provide but information is lacking about cost-effectiveness. Only two trials reported on whether or not any adverse events had occurred; these trials found no serious adverse events were related to telerehabilitation. Further trials are required. The quality of the evidence was generally of low or moderate quality.",1063,Telerehabilitation; in-person rehabilitation; activities of daily living; stroke survivors; mobility; cognitive function; adverse events; depressive symptoms,What motivations for exploring telerehabilitation were highlighted by the study?,What were the main objectives of the telerehabilitation study?,Select all of the following that are colors,What were the findings regarding activities of daily living when comparing telerehabilitation to traditional methods?,"According to the summary, how did telerehabilitation impact participants' mood compared to face-to-face therapy?",To find a more convenient and less expensive way of providing rehabilitation.; To demonstrate the superiority of face-to-face therapy.; To establish telerehabilitation as a standard practice immediately.,To find a more convenient and less expensive way of providing rehabilitation.,To compare telerehabilitation with face-to-face therapy and usual care; To eliminate the need for stroke rehabilitation; To develop new medications for stroke,To compare telerehabilitation with face-to-face therapy and usual care,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Similar outcomes were found for both methods; Telerehabilitation was significantly more effective; Traditional methods were found to be ineffective,Similar outcomes were found for both methods,No significant changes in mood were reported; Telerehabilitation led to significant mood improvement; Face-to-face therapy worsened participants' mood,No significant changes in mood were reported
5db48b4d14dab8000de45fdf,finetuned_6,Fixed-dose combination drug therapy for the prevention of heart disease and stroke,"Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) remains the leading cause of death and disability worldwide, yet many people still do not receive adequate treatment to control their risk factors. One strategy proposed to help address this gap is the use of a fixed-dose combination pill often called a polypill that combines blood pressure-lowering drugs, cholesterol-lowering medication, and sometimes antiplatelet therapy into a single tablet taken daily. This review evaluated whether such fixed-dose combination therapy leads to fewer deaths, fewer heart attacks and strokes, improved adherence to medication, and better control of cardiovascular risk factors compared with usual care, placebo, or taking medications separately. We included 13 randomised controlled trials involving a total of 9059 adults; four of these trials were new additions in this update. Most studies involved people without established ASCVD, and follow-up ranged from six weeks to nearly two years. Participants were generally in their early 60s, and about one-third were women. Newer studies tended to be larger, longer, and had a lower risk of bias. However, a major limitation across all trials was the inability to blind participants or researchers to the treatment since the fixed-dose pill differs visibly from usual care, which could influence reported outcomes. Overall, the effects of fixed-dose combination therapy on important clinical outcomes, such as death or major cardiovascular events, remain uncertain. About 1% of participants in both the fixed-dose and control groups died during the trials, showing no clear difference (risk ratio 1.10, 95% confidence interval 0.64 to 1.89). Similarly, the proportion of people who experienced a heart attack or stroke was small (4.7% in the fixed-dose group versus 3.7% in the control group), and the evidence did not show a clear effect (risk ratio 1.26, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.66). These findings are limited by the low number of events and the fact that most trials focused on risk factor changes rather than long-term outcomes. Side effects occurred commonly in both groups, but people taking the fixed-dose pill were somewhat more likely to report an adverse event (32% versus 27%), meaning a 16% increased risk. This is not unexpected since the polypill combines several medications known to cause side effects individually. Despite this, the fixed-dose combination showed consistent improvements in risk factor control. On average, systolic blood pressure was lowered by about 6 mmHg compared with usual care, and LDL cholesterol dropped by approximately 0.70 mmol/L. Total cholesterol also decreased modestly. However, these results showed substantial statistical variation between trials, so they should be interpreted cautiously. A key advantage of fixed-dose combination therapy was improved medication adherence. Across four studies, adherence to treatment was 44% higher among participants taking the polypill than among those receiving usual care. This suggests that simplifying treatment into a single pill may help more people take their medications consistently. In summary, while fixed-dose combination therapy improves blood pressure, cholesterol, and adherence, current evidence is insufficient to determine whether it reduces heart attacks, strokes, or deaths. Most trials were not designed or powered to assess these major outcomes, which likely explains the lack of clear effects. Fixed-dose therapy does appear to increase minor side effects but may help patients stay on treatment better. Ongoing and longer-term studies will be critical to determine whether the improvements in risk factors observed with polypill therapy eventually translate into meaningful reductions in cardiovascular events.","We examined the evidence on whether using fixed-dose combination drug therapy can help prevent heart attacks and strokes. This approach combines several medications typically drugs that lower blood pressure and cholesterol into a single pill. We identified 13 studies involving 9059 adults. The evidence is current up to September 2016. Researchers wanted to know if taking multiple preventive medications in a single pill was better or worse than usual care, placebo, or taking each drug separately. This updated review includes studies published since the previous Cochrane Review from 2014. Four of the included studies involved people who already had a previous heart attack or stroke, or who were at high risk of having one. Five studies followed participants for 12 months or longer. Most of the participants were middle-aged men with moderately high blood pressure or cholesterol levels, and two studies specifically included large numbers of Aboriginal or Maori participants. The fixed-dose pills in these trials contained between two and five medications, but all combinations included at least one drug to lower blood pressure and one to lower cholesterol. A major limitation across studies was that neither the participants nor the researchers could be blinded to the treatment, which could influence the results. The findings showed that it is still uncertain whether fixed-dose combination therapy reduces the risk of death, heart attacks, or strokes. Very few participants in the trials experienced these events less than 5% making it difficult to determine the true effect. The comparison with usual care also provided low-quality evidence, meaning confidence in these results is limited. Participants taking fixed-dose combination pills experienced more side effects compared with those in the control groups (32% versus 27%). This is expected because the medications involved such as aspirin, blood pressure-lowering drugs, and cholesterol-lowering drugsare known to cause side effects when taken individually. The combined pill may slightly reduce blood pressure by about 6 mmHg and lower LDL cholesterol by approximately 0.6 mmol/L, though these benefits were not seen consistently across all studies. Importantly, fixed-dose combination therapy did improve how regularly people took their preventive medications, suggesting better adherence overall. The overall quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to low, meaning that while some findings are fairly reliable, others remain uncertain. Ongoing and future clinical trials using fixed-dose combination therapy are expected to provide clearer evidence about its impact on major outcomes such as heart attacks, strokes, and deaths.",1048,Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; fixed-dose combination therapy; antiplatelet therapy; LDL cholesterol; systolic blood pressure; cardiovascular risk factors; placebo; cholesterol-lowering medication; blood pressure-lowering drugs; major cardiovascular events,How do the reported side effects of fixed-dose combination pills compare with usual care?,Which methodological limitations could affect the reliability of the studyÃ¢ÂÂs findings?,Select the items that are animals,"According to the findings, how did fixed-dose combination therapy affect medication adherence?",What effect did the fixed-dose combination pill have on blood pressure?,They are more frequent in the fixed-dose combination group.; They occur less frequently than in usual care.; The side effects are unrelated to the medications used.,They are more frequent in the fixed-dose combination group.,The inability to blind participants and researchers to treatment.; The inclusion of both men and women in the study.; The length of the follow-up period in some studies.,The inability to blind participants and researchers to treatment.; The length of the follow-up period in some studies.,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,It significantly improved adherence by simplifying treatment.; It reduced adherence due to increased side effects.; It had no impact on adherence as it was similar to usual care.,It significantly improved adherence by simplifying treatment.,It reduced systolic blood pressure by about 6 mmHg.; It increased systolic blood pressure by 5 mmHg.; It had no measurable impact on blood pressure.,It reduced systolic blood pressure by about 6 mmHg.
64345edc0fd9813bdd9ef181,static_1,Integrated compared with non-integrated orbital implants for treating anophthalmic sockets,"Anophthalmia is the absence of one or both eyes, and it can be congenital (i.e. a birth defect) or acquired later in life. There are two main types of orbital implant: integrated, whereby the implant receives a blood supply from the body that allows for the integration of the prosthesis within the tissue; and non-integrated, where the implant remains separate. Despite the remarkable progress in anophthalmic socket reconstruction and in the development of various types of implants, there are still uncertainties about the real roles of integrated (hydroxyapatite (HA), porous polyethylene (PP), composites) and non-integrated (polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA)/acrylic and silicone) orbital implants in anophthalmic socket treatment.
To assess the effects of integrated versus non-integrated orbital implants for treating anophthalmic sockets.
We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2016, Issue 7), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to August 2016), Embase (January 1980 to August 2016), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (1982 to August 2016), the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov), and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 8 August 2016.
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of integrated and non-integrated orbital implants for treating anophthalmic sockets.
Two authors independently selected relevant trials, assessed methodological quality and extracted data.
We included three studies with a total of 284 participants (250 included in analysis). The studies were conducted in India, Iran and the Netherlands. The three studies were clinically heterogenous, comparing different materials and using different surgical techniques. None of the included studies used a peg (i.e. a fixing pin used to connect the implant to the prosthesis). In general the trials were poorly reported, and we judged them to be at unclear risk of bias. One trial compared HA using traditional enucleation versus alloplastic implantation using evisceration (N = 100). This trial was probably not masked. The second trial compared PP with scleral cap enucleation versus PMMA with either myoconjunctival or traditional enucleation (N = 150). Although participants were not masked, outcome assessors were. The last trial compared HA and acrylic using the enucleation technique (N = 34) but did not report comparative effectiveness data. In the trial comparing HA versus alloplastic implantation, there was no evidence of any difference between the two groups with respect to the proportion of successful procedures at one year (risk ratio (RR) 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95 to 1.09, N = 100, low-certainty evidence). People receiving HA had slightly worse horizontal implant mobility compared to the alloplastic group (mean difference (MD) -3.35 mm, 95% CI - 4.08 to - 2.62, very low-certainty evidence) and slightly worse vertical implant motility (MD -2.76 mm, 95% CI -3.45 to -2.07, very low-certainty evidence). As different techniques were used - enucleation versus evisceration - it is not clear whether these differences in implant motility can be attributed solely to the type of material. Investigators did not report adverse events. In the trial comparing PP versus PMMA, there was no evidence of any difference between the two groups with respect to the proportion of successful procedures at one year (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.01, N = 150, low-certainty evidence). There was very low-certainty evidence of a difference in horizontal implant motility depending on whether PP was compared to PMMA with traditional enucleation (MD 1.96 mm, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.91) or PMMA with myoconjunctival enucleation (-0.57 mm, 95% CI -1.63 to 0.49). Similarly, for vertical implant motility, there was very low-certainty evidence of a difference in the comparison of PP to PMMA traditional (MD 3.12 mm 95% CI 2.36 to 3.88) but no evidence of a difference when comparing PP to PMMA myoconjunctival (MD -0.20 mm 95% CI  -1.28 to 0.88). Four people in the PP group (total N = 50) experienced adverse events (i.e. exposures) compared to 6/100 in the PMMA groups (RR 17.82, 95% CI 0.98 to 324.67, N = 150, very low-certainty evidence). None of the studies reported socket sphere size, cosmetic effect or quality of life measures.
Current very low-certainty evidence from three small published randomised controlled trials did not provide sufficient evidence to assess the effect of integrated and non-integrated material orbital implants for treating anophthalmic sockets. This review underlines the need to conduct further well-designed trials in this field.","The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out if integrated orbital implants are better than non-integrated orbital implants for treating anophthalmic sockets. Cochrane researchers collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found three studies.
There is uncertainty as to the benefits and harms of integrated compared with non-integrated orbital implants. What was studied in the review? 'Anophthalmia' is the absence of the eye in the orbit. This can occur in childhood (because of problems with development) or it can happen during the course of life (due to an accident or other eye disease).
Doctors can put an implant in the orbit to fill the void left by the removal of the eye and this together with an external prosthesis can improve the patient's appearance. This orbital implant can be made of two types of materials - integrated or non-integrated material. If the material is integrated, then new blood vessels can grow into the implant material. If the material is non-integrated, then the orbital implant remains separate from the rest of the orbit's tissue.
The review authors looked to see if the type of implant material affected the success of the surgery or, in other words, if integrated implants can provide better results than non-integrated implants. They were also interested in how much the external prosthesis could move better after surgery - using integrated or non-integrated orbital implants. Also, the authors wanted to know if the type of orbital implant material can affect people's quality of life. Were there any adverse (harmful) effects of using integrated or non-integrated orbital implants?
The type of material used for the orbital implant may not affect the success of the surgery (low-certainty evidence). The review authors judged the evidence on prosthesis movement and adverse effects as providing very little certainty about the true effects. There was no information on quality of life.

64345edc0fd9813bdd9ef181,static_2,Are anti-blood clotting drugs beneficial for people with chronic kidney disease?,"Antiplatelet agents are widely used to prevent cardiovascular events. The risks and benefits of antiplatelet agents may be different in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) for whom occlusive atherosclerotic events are less prevalent, and bleeding hazards might be increased. This is an update of a review first published in 2013. To evaluate the benefits and harms of antiplatelet agents in people with any form of CKD, including those with CKD not receiving renal replacement therapy, patients receiving any form of dialysis, and kidney transplant recipients. We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 13 July 2021 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. We selected randomised controlled trials of any antiplatelet agents versus placebo or no treatment, or direct head-to-head antiplatelet agent studies in people with CKD. Studies were included if they enrolled participants with CKD, or included people in broader at-risk populations in which data for subgroups with CKD could be disaggregated. Four authors independently extracted data from primary study reports and any available supplementary information for study population, interventions, outcomes, and risks of bias. Risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated from numbers of events and numbers of participants at risk which were extracted from each included study. The reported RRs were extracted where crude event rates were not provided. Data were pooled using the random-effects model. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. We included 113 studies, enrolling 51,959 participants; 90 studies (40,597 CKD participants) compared an antiplatelet agent with placebo or no treatment, and 29 studies (11,805 CKD participants) directly compared one antiplatelet agent with another. Fifty-six new studies were added to this 2021 update. Seven studies originally excluded from the 2013 review were included, although they had a follow-up lower than two months. Random sequence generation and allocation concealment were at low risk of bias in 16 and 22 studies, respectively. Sixty-four studies reported low-risk methods for blinding of participants and investigators; outcome assessment was blinded in 41 studies. Forty-one studies were at low risk of attrition bias, 50 studies were at low risk of selective reporting bias, and 57 studies were at low risk of other potential sources of bias. Compared to placebo or no treatment, antiplatelet agents probably reduces myocardial infarction (18 studies, 15,289 participants: RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.99, IÃÆÃÆÃâÃÂ¯ÃÆÃâÃâÃÂ¿ÃÆÃâÃâÃÂ½ = 0%; moderate certainty). Antiplatelet agents has uncertain effects on fatal or nonfatal stroke (12 studies, 10.382 participants: RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.59, I2 = 37%; very low certainty) and may have little or no effect on death from any cause (35 studies, 18,241 participants: RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.06, I2 = 14%; low certainty). Antiplatelet therapy probably increases major bleeding in people with CKD and those treated with haemodialysis (HD) (29 studies, 16,194 participants: RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.65, I2 = 12%; moderate certainty). In addition, antiplatelet therapy may increase minor bleeding in people with CKD and those treated with HD (21 studies, 13,218 participants: RR 1.55, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.90, I2= 58%; low certainty). Antiplatelet treatment may reduce early dialysis vascular access thrombosis (8 studies, 1525 participants: RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.70; low certainty). Antiplatelet agents may reduce doubling of serum creatinine in CKD (3 studies, 217 participants: RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.86, I2 = 8%; low certainty). The treatment effects of antiplatelet agents on stroke, cardiovascular death, kidney failure, kidney transplant graft loss, transplant rejection, creatinine clearance, proteinuria, dialysis access failure, loss of primary unassisted patency, failure to attain suitability for dialysis, need of intervention and cardiovascular hospitalisation were uncertain. Limited data were available for direct head-to-head comparisons of antiplatelet drugs, including prasugrel, ticagrelor, different doses of clopidogrel, abciximab, defibrotide, sarpogrelate and beraprost. Antiplatelet agents probably reduced myocardial infarction and increased major bleeding, but do not appear to reduce all-cause and cardiovascular death among people with CKD and those treated with dialysis. The treatment effects of antiplatelet agents compared with each other are uncertain.","People with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have an increased risk of heart disease that can block the blood supply to the heart or brain causing a heart attack or stroke. Drugs that prevent blood clots from forming (antiplatelet agents) can prevent deaths caused by clots in arteries in the general adult population. However, there may be fewer benefits for people who have CKD, because blood clots in arteries is a less common cause of death or reason to be admitted to hospital compared with heart failure or sudden death in these people. People with CKD also have an increased tendency for bleeding due to changes in how the blood clots, so antiplatelet agents may therefore be more hazardous when CKD is present. This updated review evaluated the benefits and harms of antiplatelet agents to prevent cardiovascular disease and death, and the impact on dialysis vascular access (fistula or graft) function in people who have CKD. We identified 90 studies comparing antiplatelet agents with placebo or no treatment and 29 studies directly comparing one antiplatelet agent with another. Antiplatelet agents probably prevent heart attacks, but do not clearly reduce death or stroke. Treatment with these agents may increase the risk of major and minor bleeding. Clotting of dialysis access was prevented with antiplatelet agents. The benefits of antiplatelet agents for people with CKD is probably limited to the prevention of a heart attack; the treatment does not appear to prevent stroke or death and probably incurs excess serious bleeding that may require hospital admission or transfusion.",1091,Antiplatelet agents; renal replacement therapy; dialysis; myocardial infarction; fatal or nonfatal stroke; major bleeding; dialysis vascular access thrombosis; serum creatinine; cardiovascular death; transplant graft loss,What is one potential benefit of antiplatelet agents for people with CKD?,Which outcome is not significantly reduced by antiplatelet agents in CKD patients?,Select all of the following that are colors,Identify a potential risk associated with antiplatelet use in CKD patients.,Describe the impact of antiplatelet agents on the risk of heart attack in CKD patients.,Preventing heart attacks; Reducing all-cause mortality; Decreasing major bleeding,Preventing heart attacks,Stroke; Heart attack; Dialysis access clotting,Stroke,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Major bleeding; Increased kidney function; Decreased hospitalization,Major bleeding,They probably prevent heart attacks.; They have no effect on heart attacks.; They increase the risk of heart attacks.,They probably prevent heart attacks.
64345edc0fd9813bdd9ef181,static_2,Clopidogrel plus aspirin versus aspirin alone for preventing cardiovascular events,"Aspirin is the prophylactic antiplatelet drug of choice for people with cardiovascular disease. Adding a second antiplatelet drug to aspirin may produce additional benefit for people at high risk and people with established cardiovascular disease. This is an update to a previously published review from 2011.
To review the benefit and harm of adding clopidogrel to aspirin therapy for preventing cardiovascular events in people who have coronary disease, ischaemic cerebrovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, or were at high risk of atherothrombotic disease, but did not have a coronary stent. We updated the searches of CENTRAL (2017, Issue 6), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 4 July 2017) and Embase (Ovid, 1947 to 3 July 2017) on 4 July 2017. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP portal, and handsearched reference lists. We applied no language restrictions. We included all randomised controlled trials comparing over 30 days use of aspirin plus clopidogrel with aspirin plus placebo or aspirin alone in people with coronary disease, ischaemic cerebrovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, or at high risk of atherothrombotic disease. We excluded studies including only people with coronary drug-eluting stent (DES) or non-DES, or both. We collected data on mortality from cardiovascular causes, all-cause mortality, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction, fatal and non-fatal ischaemic stroke, major and minor bleeding. The overall treatment effect was estimated by the pooled risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI), using a fixed-effect model (Mantel-Haenszel); we used a random-effects model in cases of moderate or severe heterogeneity (I2=30%). We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We used GRADE profiler (GRADE Pro) to import data from Review Manager to create a 'Summary of findings' table. The search identified 13 studies in addition to the two studies in the previous version of our systematic review. Overall, we included data from 15 trials with 33,970 people. We completed a 'Risk of bias' assessment for all studies. The risk of bias was low in four trials because they were at low risk of bias for all key domains (random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, selective outcome reporting and incomplete outcome data), even if some of them were funded by the pharmaceutical industry. Analysis showed no difference in the effectiveness of aspirin plus clopidogrel in preventing cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.10; participants = 31,903; studies = 7; moderate quality evidence), and no evidence of a difference in all-cause mortality (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.25; participants = 32,908; studies = 9; low quality evidence). There was a lower risk of fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction with clopidogrel plus aspirin compared with aspirin plus placebo or aspirin alone (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.90; participants = 16,175; studies = 6; moderate quality evidence). There was a reduction in the risk of fatal and non-fatal ischaemic stroke (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.91; participants = 4006; studies = 5; moderate quality evidence). However, there was a higher risk of major bleeding with clopidogrel plus aspirin compared with aspirin plus placebo or aspirin alone (RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.64; participants = 33,300; studies = 10; moderate quality evidence) and of minor bleeding (RR 2.03, 95% CI 1.75 to 2.36; participants = 14,731; studies = 8; moderate quality evidence). Overall, we would expect 13 myocardial infarctions and 23 ischaemic strokes be prevented for every 1000 patients treated with the combination in a median follow-up period of 12 months, but 9 major bleeds and 33 minor bleeds would be caused during a median follow-up period of 10.5 and 6 months, respectively. The available evidence demonstrates that the use of clopidogrel plus aspirin in people at high risk of cardiovascular disease and people with established cardiovascular disease without a coronary stent is associated with a reduction in the risk of myocardial infarction and ischaemic stroke, and an increased risk of major and minor bleeding compared with aspirin alone. According to GRADE criteria, the quality of evidence was moderate for all outcomes except all-cause mortality (low quality evidence) and adverse events (very low quality evidence).","We reviewed the evidence about the effect of clopidogrel and aspirin in people at high risk of getting heart disease or having a stroke, and in those who already have heart disease. Aspirin is widely used to prevent heart disease, but the effects for people at high risk of getting heart disease are small. We wanted to find out whether taking clopidogrel (which is also used to prevent heart disease) and aspirin is better to prevent getting heart disease or having a stroke than taking aspirin alone. We also wanted to find out if people who already had heart disease were at less risk of dying, having a heart attack or stroke if they took clopidogrel and aspirin. This review contains evidence up to July 2017. We found 15 studies which together included more than 30,000 people at high risk of heart disease who are taking aspirin. All studies randomly assigned participants to the intervention group (taking aspirin and clopidogrel) or the control group (taking aspirin and placebo (a pretend treatment that has no effect). Participants took clopidogrel between six weeks and 3.4 years, depending on the study they took part in. The results do not apply to people with recent placement of coronary stents (tubes inserted in the blood vessel to keep it open), who were excluded from this review. The results showed that there is a benefit of adding clopidogrel to aspirin in terms of reducing the risk of heart attack or stroke. However, there is a higher risk of major and minor bleeding associated with this. There was no effect on death due to heart problems or death from any cause. Using Cochrane criteria, four trials were at low risk of bias. Using GRADE standards, the quality of published evidence was moderate for most results, but low for death from any cause and very low for side effects.",1068,antiplatelet drug; cardiovascular disease; coronary disease; ischaemic cerebrovascular disease; peripheral arterial disease; atherothrombotic disease; coronary stent; myocardial infarction; ischaemic stroke; major bleeding,What was the primary motivation for the study?,What outcome was observed with adding clopidogrel to aspirin?,Select all of the following that are colors,Which adverse effect was noted when combining clopidogrel with aspirin?,,To assess whether adding clopidogrel to aspirin reduces heart disease risk.; To examine the impact of aspirin on coronary stents.; To determine the best time to take aspirin daily.,To assess whether adding clopidogrel to aspirin reduces heart disease risk.,Reduced risk of heart attack or stroke.; Increased risk of coronary stent complications.; Enhanced performance in physical activities.,Reduced risk of heart attack or stroke.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Higher risk of major and minor bleeding.; Increased likelihood of headaches.; Lower risk of developing high blood pressure.,Higher risk of major and minor bleeding.,,
64345edc0fd9813bdd9ef181,interactive_3,Ivermectin for preventing and treating COVID-19,"Ivermectin, an antiparasitic agent, inhibits the replication of viruses in vitro, and the molecular hypothesis of its antiviral mode of action suggests an inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2 replication in early stages of infection, although current evidence on ivermectin for prevention of infection and treatment of COVID-19 is conflicting. The objective was to assess the efficacy and safety of ivermectin plus standard of care compared to standard of care plus or minus placebo, or any other proven intervention, for people with COVID-19 receiving inpatient or outpatient treatment, and for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection as postexposure prophylaxis. We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, Web of Science, WHO COVID-19 Global literature, and the HTA database weekly without language restrictions to 16 December 2021, and additionally included trials with more than 1000 participants up to April 2022. We included randomized controlled trials comparing ivermectin to standard of care, placebo, or another proven intervention for treatment of confirmed COVID-19, irrespective of disease severity or setting, and for prevention of infection, with co-interventions required to be the same in both groups; in this update we reappraised eligible trials for research integrity, including only prospectively registered RCTs according to WHO guidelines. We assessed RCTs for bias using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool and used GRADE to rate certainty of evidence for outcomes in inpatients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19, outpatients with mild COVID-19, and for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We excluded seven of the 14 trials from the previous review because six were not prospectively registered and one was non-randomized; the updated review includes 11 trials with 3409 participants investigating ivermectin plus standard of care compared to standard of care plus or minus placebo. No trial investigated ivermectin for prevention or compared it to an intervention with proven efficacy. Five trials treated moderate COVID-19 in inpatient settings and six treated mild COVID-19 in outpatient settings; eight trials were double-blind and placebo-controlled, and three were open-label, with around 50% of results assessed as low risk of bias. We identified 31 ongoing trials and 28 potentially eligible trials without published results or with reporting disparities, held in awaiting classification until authors clarify details. For treating moderate-to-severe inpatient COVID-19, we are uncertain whether ivermectin plus standard of care reduces or increases all-cause mortality at 28 days (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.14 to 2.51; 3 trials, 230 participants; very low-certainty evidence), clinical worsening measured by new need for ventilation or death (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.33 to 2.04; 2 trials, 118 participants; very low-certainty evidence), or serious adverse events (RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.07 to 35.89; 2 trials, 197 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Ivermectin plus standard of care may have little or no effect on clinical improvement measured by discharge alive at day 28 (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.35; 1 trial, 73 participants; low-certainty evidence), on any adverse events during the trial (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.79; 3 trials, 228 participants; low-certainty evidence), and on viral clearance at seven days (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.58; 3 trials, 231 participants; low-certainty evidence); no trial investigated quality of life. For treating outpatients with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19, ivermectin plus standard of care probably has little or no effect on all-cause mortality at day 28 (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.25; 6 trials, 2860 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and little or no effect on quality of life measured with the PROMIS Global-10 scale (physical and mental component MD 0.00, 95% CI ranges crossing 0; 1358 participants; high-certainty evidence). Ivermectin may have little or no effect on clinical worsening measured by hospital admission or death (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.20 to 6.02; 2 trials, 590 participants; low-certainty evidence), clinical improvement measured by resolution of symptoms by day 14 (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.36; 2 trials, 478 participants; low-certainty evidence), serious adverse events (RR 2.27, 95% CI 0.62 to 8.31; 5 trials, 1502 participants; low-certainty evidence), any adverse events (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.76; 5 trials, 1502 participants; low-certainty evidence), and viral clearance at day 7 (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.48; 2 trials, 331 participants; low-certainty evidence); no trials reporting duration of symptoms were eligible for meta-analysis. For outpatients, there is currently low- to high-certainty evidence that ivermectin has no beneficial effect for people with COVID-19, and based on very low-certainty evidence for inpatients, we remain uncertain whether ivermectin prevents death or clinical worsening or increases serious adverse events, while low-certainty evidence suggests no beneficial effect on clinical improvement, viral clearance, or adverse events; no evidence is available for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this update, certainty increased due to higher-quality trials with more participants, and according to the living review approach, searches will continue to be updated.","Ivermectin is a medicine used to treat parasites, such as intestinal parasites in animals and scabies in humans, and is inexpensive and widely used where parasitic infestations are common, with few unwanted effects; medical regulators have not approved ivermectin for COVID-19. We wanted to update our knowledge of whether ivermectin reduces death, illness, and length of infection in people with COVID-19, or is useful in prevention, and included trials comparing the medicine to placebo, usual care, or treatments known to work to some extent such as dexamethasone, while excluding trials comparing ivermectin to medicines that do not work, like hydroxychloroquine, or whose effectiveness is uncertain. We evaluated effects of ivermectin in infected people on people dying, whether COVID-19 got better or worse, quality of life, serious and non-serious unwanted effects, and viral clearance; for prevention, we sought effects on preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease. We searched for randomized controlled trials investigating ivermectin to prevent or treat COVID-19, requiring laboratory-confirmed infections for hospital or outpatient participants, and in this update also investigated trustworthiness of trials, including them only if they fulfilled clear ethical and scientific criteria; we compared and summarized results and rated confidence in the evidence based on common criteria such as trial methods and sizes. We excluded seven of the 14 trials from the previous review as they did not fulfil expected criteria, and with four new trials included 11 trials with 3409 participants investigating ivermectin with usual care compared with the same usual care or placebo; for treatment, five trials were in hospital with moderate COVID-19 and six trials in outpatients with mild COVID-19, using different doses and treatment durations, and no trial investigated ivermectin for prevention; we also found 31 ongoing trials and 28 additional trials requiring clarification or not yet published. Treating people in hospital with COVID-19, we do not know whether ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment leads to more or fewer deaths, worsens or improves condition measured by need for ventilation or death, or increases or reduces serious unwanted events; ivermectin may make little or no difference to improving condition measured by discharge or to non-serious unwanted events, and seven days after treatment may make little or no difference to reduction of negative tests. Treating outpatients with COVID-19, ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment probably makes little or no difference to people dying and makes little or no difference to quality of life; it may make little or no difference to worsening condition measured by admission or death, serious unwanted events, non-serious unwanted events, improvement of symptoms in 14 days, or negative tests at seven days. Our confidence in the evidence, especially for outpatients, improved since the last review because more participants were included in high-quality trials, and although we are quite certain about risk of dying and quality of life, confidence is still low for many other outcomes because few events were measured, methods differed, and not all relevant outcomes were reported.",1109,Ivermectin; SARS-CoV-2; antiparasitic agent; postexposure prophylaxis; co-interventions; WHO guidelines; all-cause mortality; serious adverse events; clinical improvement; viral clearance,How could the exclusion of certain trials from the analysis impact the confidence in the study's conclusions?,What are the implications of finding little or no effect of ivermectin on the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients?,Select all of the following that are colors,"Considering the studyÃ¢ÂÂs findings, how might future research on ivermectin's use in COVID-19 treatment be designed?",What was the main objective of the study discussed in the summary?,It increases confidence by ensuring higher-quality evidence; It decreases confidence as fewer trials are considered; It has no impact since only reliable data is excluded,It increases confidence by ensuring higher-quality evidence,Ivermectin should not be used as a standard treatment for COVID-19; Ivermectin should be used in combination with other treatments; The use of ivermectin is justified in certain emergency situations,Ivermectin should not be used as a standard treatment for COVID-19,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,"Focus on larger-scale, high-quality, double-blind trials; Incorporate non-randomized participants to increase diversity; Reduce the number of placebo controls to simplify results","Focus on larger-scale, high-quality, double-blind trials",To assess the efficacy and safety of ivermectin compared to standard care.; To measure the economic impact of ivermectin.; To develop new antiparasitic drugs.,To assess the efficacy and safety of ivermectin compared to standard care.
64345edc0fd9813bdd9ef181,interactive_4,Best therapy for people with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who have not been treated without a targetable mutation and moderately impaired performance status,"Most people who are newly diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have advanced disease. For these people, survival is determined by various patient- and tumor-related factors, of which the performance status (PS) is the most important prognostic factor. People with PS 0 or 1 are usually treated with systemic therapies, whereas people with PS 3 or 4 most often receive supportive care. However, treatment for people with PS 2 without a targetable mutation remains unclear. Historically, people with a PS 2 cancer are frequently excluded from (important) clinical trials because of poorer outcomes and increased toxicity. We aim to address this knowledge gap, as this group of people represents a significant proportion (20% to 30%) of the total population with newly diagnosed lung cancer.
To identify the best first-line therapy for advanced lung cancer in people with performance status 2 without a targetable mutation or with an unknown mutation status.
We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. 
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared different chemotherapy (with or without angiogenesis inhibitor) or immunotherapy regimens, specifically designed for people with PS 2 only or studies including a subgroup of these people.
We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. overall survival (OS), 2. health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and 3. toxicity/adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were 4. tumor response rate, 5. progression-free survival, and 6. survival rates at six and 12 months' treatment. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence for each outcome.
We included 22 trials in this review and identified one ongoing trial. Twenty studies compared chemotherapy with different regimens, of which 11 compared non-platinum therapy (monotherapy or doublet) versus platinum doublet. We found no studies comparing best supportive care with chemotherapy and only two abstracts analyzing chemotherapy versus immunotherapy. We found that platinum doublet therapy showed superior OS compared to non-platinum therapy (hazard ratio [HR] 0.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.57 to 0.78; 7 trials, 697 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There were no differences in six-month survival rates (risk ratio [RR] 1.00, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.41; 6 trials, 632 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), whereas 12-month survival rates were improved for treatment with platinum doublet therapy (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.87 to 0.97; 11 trials, 1567 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). PFS and tumor response rate were also better for people treated with platinum doublet therapy, with moderate-certainty evidence (PFS: HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.77; 5 trials, 487 participants; tumor response rate: RR 2.25, 95% CI 1.67 to 3.05; 9 trials, 964 participants). When analyzing toxicity rates, we found that platinum doublet therapy increased grade 3 to 5 hematologic toxicities, all with low-certainty evidence (anemia: RR 1.98, 95% CI 1.00 to 3.92; neutropenia: RR 2.75, 95% CI 1.30 to 5.82; thrombocytopenia: RR 3.96, 95% CI 1.73 to 9.06; all 8 trials, 935 participants). Only four trials reported HRQoL data; however, the methodology was different per trial and we were unable to perform a meta-analysis. Although evidence is limited, there were no differences in 12-month survival rates or tumor response rates between carboplatin and cisplatin regimens. With an indirect comparison, carboplatin seemed to have better 12-month survival rates than cisplatin compared to non-platinum therapy. The assessment of the efficacy of immunotherapy in people with PS 2 was limited. There might be a place for single-agent immunotherapy, but the data provided by the included studies did not encourage the use of double-agent immunotherapy.
This review showed that as a first-line treatment for people with PS 2 with advanced NSCLC, platinum doublet therapy seems to be preferred over non-platinum therapy, with a higher response rate, PFS, and OS. Although the risk for grade 3 to 5 hematologic toxicity is higher, these events are often relatively mild and easy to treat. Since trials using checkpoint inhibitors in people with PS 2 are scarce, we identified an important knowledge gap regarding their role in people with advanced NSCLC and PS 2.","Lung cancer is the most frequent cause of cancer-related death worldwide and NSCLC is the most common subtype. At the time of diagnosis, the disease has already spread in more than half of all cases. In the tumors of a minority of people diagnosed with NSCLC that has spread to other parts of the body specific mutations can be found, which are treated distinct from the majority of people without such mutations.
NSCLC can only be treated with life-prolonging medicines such as chemotherapy (a medicine used to destroy cancer cells) or immunotherapy (a medicine that boosts the person's immune system and helps the body find and destroy cancer cells). Selecting the best treatment depends on the health condition of the person. That condition is determined using a scale from 0 (no symptoms) to 5 (dead). There is no discussion on the treatment of relatively fit people (scoring 0 or 1), as they often tolerate these treatments relatively well. People with a low health condition (scoring 3 or 4) receive only supportive care in most cases. However, although representing 20% to 30% of all people, the best treatment for moderately impaired people (PS 2) is not clear, as they often do not participate in trials.
Our objective was to investigate the best therapy for people with advanced NSCLC without a specific mutation with PS 2.
We searched medical databases for clinical trials comparing treatments for advanced NSCLC with best supportive care or other treatments.
We found 22 trials; 20 compared different types of chemotherapy and two compared chemotherapy versus immunotherapy.
People treated with chemotherapy regimens using two medicines, including a platinum-based medicine, had longer survival than people treated with chemotherapies without a platinum-based medicine. However, these people did have more side effects, especially with a negative influence on the bone marrow (matter found in the center of bones), resulting in a temporary lack of red and white blood cells, and platelets. The few studies that analyzed health-related quality of life all used different methods of measurement. We found no difference in quality of life when we looked at those studies individually. We found two partly published trials studying immunotherapy, which found no survival benefit compared to chemotherapy.
We are moderately confident in our results that chemotherapies with a platinum-based medicine increases survival. We are also moderately confident in the evidence evaluating the time to progression of disease because in all included studies, both investigators and trial participants were fully aware of which treatment the participants received. This might lead to substantial bias. In addition, we have little confidence in the evidence regarding toxicities because the evidence is based on a small number of studies with conflicting outcomes.",1023,non-small cell lung cancer; performance status; targetable mutation; immunotherapy regimens; overall survival; health-related quality of life; progression-free survival; tumor response rate; platinum doublet therapy; hematologic toxicities,What are the underlying motivations for focusing on people with performance status 2 in the study of NSCLC treatments?,How did the study distinguish between the effects of platinum-based chemotherapy versus non-platinum regimens?,Select the items that are animals,Critique the robustness of the studyÃ¢ÂÂs conclusions regarding immunotherapy for PS 2 patients.,What is the primary aim of the study discussed in the plain-language summary?,"They often tolerate treatment well, similar to those with PS 0 or 1.; They represent a significant but often neglected portion of NSCLC cases.; They are frequently included in clinical trials, which simplifies research.",They represent a significant but often neglected portion of NSCLC cases.,It demonstrated improved survival outcomes with platinum-based regimens.; It showed no difference in tumor response rates.; It highlighted consistent quality of life improvements with non-platinum regimens.,It demonstrated improved survival outcomes with platinum-based regimens.,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,The study robustly proves the superiority of immunotherapy over chemotherapy.; The evidence for the efficacy of immunotherapy was limited.; The study found clear benefits of double-agent immunotherapy.,The evidence for the efficacy of immunotherapy was limited.,To find the best therapy for people with PS 2 in advanced NSCLC without a specific mutation; To develop a new platinum-based chemotherapy drug; To compare supportive care with chemotherapy,To find the best therapy for people with PS 2 in advanced NSCLC without a specific mutation
64345edc0fd9813bdd9ef181,interactive_4,Does taxation of unprocessed sugar or foods with added sugar reduce their consumption and prevent obesity or other adverse health outcomes?,"Global prevalence of overweight and obesity are alarming. For tackling this public health problem, preventive public health and policy actions are urgently needed. Some countries implemented food taxes in the past and some were subsequently abolished. Some countries, such as Norway, Hungary, Denmark, Bermuda, Dominica, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and the Navajo Nation (USA), specifically implemented taxes on unprocessed sugar and sugar-added foods. These taxes on unprocessed sugar and sugar-added foods are fiscal policy interventions, implemented to decrease their consumption and in turn reduce adverse health-related, economic and social effects associated with these food products. To assess the effects of taxation of unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods in the general population on the consumption of unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods, the prevalence and incidence of overweight and obesity, and the prevalence and incidence of other diet-related health outcomes. We searched CENTRAL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, Embase and 15 other databases and trials registers on 12 September 2019. We handsearched the reference list of all records of included studies, searched websites of international organisations and institutions, and contacted review advisory group members to identify planned, ongoing or unpublished studies. We included studies with the following populations: children (0 to 17 years) and adults (18 years or older) from any country and setting. Exclusion applied to studies with specific subgroups, such as people with any disease who were overweight or obese as a side-effect of the disease. The review included studies with taxes on or artificial increases of selling prices for unprocessed sugar or food products that contain added sugar (e.g. sweets, ice cream, confectionery, and bakery products), or both, as intervention, regardless of the taxation level or price increase. In line with Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) criteria, we included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-randomised controlled trials (cRCTs), non-randomised controlled trials (nRCTs), controlled before-after (CBA) studies, and interrupted time series (ITS) studies. We included controlled studies with more than one intervention or control site and ITS studies with a clearly defined intervention time and at least three data points before and three after the intervention. Our primary outcomes were consumption of unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods, energy intake, overweight, and obesity. Our secondary outcomes were substitution and diet, expenditure, demand, and other health outcomes. Two review authors independently screened all eligible records for inclusion, assessed the risk of bias, and performed data extraction.Two review authors independently assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We retrieved a total of 24,454 records. After deduplicating records, 18,767 records remained for title and abstract screening. Of 11 potentially relevant studies, we included one ITS study with 40,210 household-level observations from the Hungarian Household Budget and Living Conditions Survey. The baseline ranged from January 2008 to August 2011, the intervention was implemented on September 2011, and follow-up was until December 2012 (16 months). The intervention was a tax - the so-called 'Hungarian public health product tax' - on sugar-added foods, including selected foods exceeding a specific sugar threshold value. The intervention includes co-interventions: the taxation of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) and of foods high in salt or caffeine. The study provides evidence on the effect of taxing foods exceeding a specific sugar threshold value on the consumption of sugar-added foods. After implementation of the Hungarian public health product tax, the mean consumption of taxed sugar-added foods (measured in units of kg) decreased by 4.0% (standardised mean difference (SMD) ?0.040, 95% confidence interval (CI) ?0.07 to ?0.01; very low-certainty evidence). The study was at low risk of bias in terms of performance bias, detection bias and reporting bias, with the shape of effect pre-specified and the intervention unlikely to have any effect on data collection. The study was at unclear risk of attrition bias and at high risk in terms of other bias and the independence of the intervention. We rated the certainty of the evidence as very low for the primary and secondary outcomes. The Hungarian public health product tax included a tax on sugar-added foods but did not include a tax on unprocessed sugar. We did not find eligible studies reporting on the taxation of unprocessed sugar. No studies reported on the primary outcomes of consumption of unprocessed sugar, energy intake, overweight, and obesity. No studies reported on the secondary outcomes of substitution and diet, demand, and other health outcomes. No studies reported on differential effects across population subgroups. We could not perform meta-analyses or pool study results. There was very limited evidence and the certainty of the evidence was very low. Despite the reported reduction in consumption of taxed sugar-added foods, we are uncertain whether taxing unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods has an effect on reducing their consumption and preventing obesity or other adverse health outcomes. Further robustly conducted studies are required to draw concrete conclusions on the effectiveness of taxing unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods for reducing their consumption and preventing obesity or other adverse health outcomes.","As outlined by the World Health Organization, 'globesity' (the rise in overweight and obesity globally) is a major world challenge. A sugar-rich diet, especially when combined with physical inactivity, may cause overweight and obesity, and other harmful health outcomes. There are direct costs to healthcare services of people being overweight or obese, such as preventing and treating health problems that this causes. There are also costs to society as a whole when people who are ill through being overweight or obese are unable to work. This review may be of interest to government public health agencies, policy decision-makers, food retailers, and food industries. This review and subsequent updates of this review may change policy and affect a government's motivation to create a tax on unprocessed sugar and foods with added sugar. It also may motivate food industries to reformulate their products to contain lower levels of added sugar. We wanted to know if taxation of unprocessed sugar and foods with added sugar (other than sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs)) reduced their consumption, changed people's energy intake, and reduced overweight and obesity. We also wanted to know if taxation changed people's diet and spending, and had an effect on other diet-related health problems. We searched for ongoing or published studies up to October 2019. Of a total of 24,454 records retrieved, we identified one 'interrupted time series' (ITS) study meeting our eligibility criteria to assess the impact of a tax on sugar-added foods (but not unprocessed sugar). The study used data from the Hungarian Household Budget and Living Conditions Survey, with observations from 40,210 households. Evidence from the study included a 'baseline' (the situation before taxation), ranging from January 2008 to August 2011. The Hungarian public health product tax was implemented on September 2011. The duration of the follow-up period (measuring the effects of taxation) was 16 months. The study was funded by the Scottish Institute for Research in Economics (SIRE) Early Career Engagement Grant. The included study provided very limited evidence that taxing foods with added sugar reduced their consumption by 4%. We are very uncertain about this evidence because the study did not use the strongest methods, looked at other kinds of taxation as well as taxing foods with added sugar, and may not have correctly classified food types. We are uncertain whether taxing foods with added sugar has an effect on reducing their consumption. The included study did not investigate the effects of taxing unprocessed sugar. Further research is needed to assess the effectiveness of taxing unprocessed sugar or foods with added sugar for reducing their consumption and preventing obesity or other adverse health outcomes. Studies should take place in countries that have implemented these taxes and should look at cost-effectiveness as well as the health benefits of taxing unprocessed sugar or foods with added sugar as a public health policy for preventing overweight, obesity or other adverse health outcomes. Countries that have implemented these taxes are Bermuda, Dominica, Hungary, India, Norway, the Navajo Nation (USA), and St. Vincent and Grenadines.",1103,overweight and obesity; preventive public health; fiscal policy interventions; Hungarian public health product tax; sugar-sweetened beverages; very low-certainty evidence; consumption of sugar-added foods; prevalence and incidence; demand and other health outcomes,Evaluate the impact of sugar taxation on public health policy motivation.,What potential effects on food reformulation might result from this study's findings?,Select all of the following that are fruits,Analyze the reasons for including various countries with implemented sugar taxes in the study.,Judge the reliability of the study based on the methods used to assess sugar consumption reduction.,It may motivate policy changes to implement sugar taxes.; It provides conclusive evidence to halt all sugar taxes.; It discourages future research on sugar taxation policies.,It may motivate policy changes to implement sugar taxes.,Industries could reduce added sugar in products.; Industries might eliminate all sugar from products.; Industries will increase sugar content to boost sales.,Industries could reduce added sugar in products.,dog; blue; grape,grape,To provide a comprehensive review of international tax efficacy.; To identify global trends in sugar consumption reduction.; To facilitate the exploration of diverse tax-related health outcomes.,To facilitate the exploration of diverse tax-related health outcomes.,The methods used were robust and reliable.; The study lacked strong methods and classifications.; The reliability was high due to the large sample size.,The study lacked strong methods and classifications.
64345edc0fd9813bdd9ef181,finetuned_5,Selenium for preventing cancer,"This review is the third update of the Cochrane review ""Selenium for preventing cancer"". Selenium is a naturally occurring element with both nutritional and toxicological properties. Higher selenium exposure and selenium supplements have been suggested to protect against several types of cancer.
To gather and present evidence needed to address two research questions: 1. What is the aetiological relationship between selenium exposure and cancer risk in humans? 2. Describe the efficacy of selenium supplementation for cancer prevention in humans.
We updated electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 2), MEDLINE (Ovid, 2013 to January 2017, week 4), and Embase (2013 to 2017, week 6), as well as searches of clinical trial registries.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and longitudinal observational studies that enrolled adult participants.
We performed random-effects (RE) meta-analyses when two or more RCTs were available for a specific outcome. We conducted RE meta-analyses when five or more observational studies were available for a specific outcome. We assessed risk of bias in RCTs and in observational studies using Cochrane's risk assessment tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, respectively. We considered in the primary analysis data pooled from RCTs with low risk of bias. We assessed the certainty of evidence by using the GRADE approach.
We included 83 studies in this updated review: two additional RCTs (10 in total) and a few additional trial reports for previously included studies. RCTs involved 27,232 participants allocated to either selenium supplements or placebo. For analyses of RCTs with low risk of bias, the summary risk ratio (RR) for any cancer incidence was 1.01 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.10; 3 studies, 19,475 participants; high-certainty evidence). The RR for estimated cancer mortality was 1.02 (95% CI 0.80 to 1.30; 1 study, 17,448 participants). For the most frequently investigated site-specific cancers, investigators provided little evidence of any effect of selenium supplementation. Two RCTs with 19,009 participants indicated that colorectal cancer was unaffected by selenium administration (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.43), as were non-melanoma skin cancer (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.30 to 4.42; 2 studies, 2027 participants), lung cancer (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.50; 2 studies, 19,009 participants), breast cancer (RR 2.04, 95% CI 0.44 to 9.55; 1 study, 802 participants), bladder cancer (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.52; 2 studies, 19,009 participants), and prostate cancer (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.14; 4 studies, 18,942 participants). Certainty of the evidence was high for all of these cancer sites, except for breast cancer, which was of moderate certainty owing to imprecision, and non-melanoma skin cancer, which we judged as moderate certainty owing to high heterogeneity. RCTs with low risk of bias suggested increased melanoma risk. Results for most outcomes were similar when we included all RCTs in the meta-analysis, regardless of risk of bias. Selenium supplementation did not reduce overall cancer incidence (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.14; 5 studies, 21,860 participants) nor mortality (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.32; 2 studies, 18,698 participants). Summary RRs for site-specific cancers showed limited changes compared with estimates from high-quality studies alone, except for liver cancer, for which results were reversed. In the largest trial, the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Trial, selenium supplementation increased risks of alopecia and dermatitis, and for participants with highest background selenium status, supplementation also increased risk of high-grade prostate cancer. RCTs showed a slightly increased risk of type 2 diabetes associated with supplementation. A hypothesis generated by the Nutritional Prevention of Cancer Trial - that individuals with low blood selenium levels could reduce their risk of cancer (particularly prostate cancer) by increasing selenium intake - has not been confirmed. As RCT participants have been overwhelmingly male (88%), we could not assess the potential influence of sex or gender. We included 15 additional observational cohort studies (70 in total; over 2,360,000 participants). We found that lower cancer incidence (summary odds ratio (OR) 0.72, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.93; 7 studies, 76,239 participants) and lower cancer mortality (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.97; 7 studies, 183,863 participants) were associated with the highest category of selenium exposure compared with the lowest. Cancer incidence was lower in men (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.14, 4 studies, 29,365 men) than in women (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.77, 2 studies, 18,244 women). Data show a decrease in risk of site-specific cancers for stomach, colorectal, lung, breast, bladder, and prostate cancers. However, these studies have major weaknesses due to study design, exposure misclassification, and potential unmeasured confounding due to lifestyle or nutritional factors covarying with selenium exposure beyond those taken into account in multi-variable analyses. In addition, no evidence of a dose-response relation between selenium status and cancer risk emerged. Certainty of evidence was very low for each outcome. Some studies suggested that genetic factors might modify the relation between selenium and cancer risk - an issue that merits further investigation.
Well-designed and well-conducted RCTs have shown no beneficial effect of selenium supplements in reducing cancer risk (high certainty of evidence). Some RCTs have raised concerns by reporting a higher incidence of high-grade prostate cancer and type 2 diabetes in participants with selenium supplementation. No clear evidence of an influence of baseline participant selenium status on outcomes has emerged in these studies. Observational longitudinal studies have shown an inverse association between selenium exposure and risk of some cancer types, but null and direct relations have also been reported, and no systematic pattern suggesting dose-response relations has emerged. These studies suffer from limitations inherent to the observational design, including exposure misclassification and unmeasured confounding. Overall, there is no evidence to suggest that increasing selenium intake through diet or supplementation prevents cancer in humans. However, more research is needed to assess whether selenium may modify the risk of cancer in individuals with a specific genetic background or nutritional status, and to investigate possible differential effects of various forms of selenium.","We reviewed the evidence investigating the relation between selenium intake and cancer prevention. This review updates the most recent Cochrane review on this topic (Vinceti 2014, which was an update of Dennert 2011.
Selenium is a naturally occurring element that individuals are exposed to mainly through food consumption, although exposure can also occur through air, drinking water, and dietary supplements. Small amounts of selenium are essential for certain biological functions in humans, but slightly higher amounts can pose a toxicity risk, making selenium an element with a narrow, but as yet not well-defined, safe range of exposure. Selenium occurs in many different chemical forms with different biological activity. From the late 1960s, a few observational studies reported that people with high levels of selenium in their diet or in their body tissues had lower risk of cancer, and some laboratory studies showed that selenium could inhibit the growth of cancer cells. This led to widespread interest in selenium supplements and claims that taking such supplements could prevent cancer. Since that time, many more observational studies have been conducted to compare cancer rates among individuals with high and low selenium exposure. More recently, several randomised controlled trials designed to assess whether selenium supplementation can prevent cancer have been carried out. These trials played a major role in enhancing our understanding of the relation between selenium and cancer risk as a result of their stronger study design as compared with observational studies. The most recent trials in particular have shown high methodological quality and statistical power. Several trials focused on whether selenium could prevent prostate cancer.
This review includes 10 trials in which adults were randomly assigned to receive selenium supplements or placebo, and 70 observational studies in which adults were followed over time to determine whether their baseline selenium status was associated with their risk of cancer. The evidence is current to January 2017.
All of the high-quality randomised trials reported no effect of selenium on reducing overall risk of cancer or risk of particular cancers, including the most investigated outcome - prostate cancer. Some trials unexpectedly suggested that selenium may increase risks of high-grade prostate cancer, type 2 diabetes, and dermatological abnormalities.
Observational studies have yielded inconsistent evidence of a possible effect of selenium exposure on cancer risk, with no evidence of a dose-response relation. When we pooled results of these studies, overall they suggested an inverse relation between cancer exposure and subsequent incidence of any cancer or some specific cancers, such as colon and prostate cancer. However, observational studies have major weaknesses. The selenium exposure status of participants could have been misclassified owing to limitations of the indicators of selenium exposure used, as well as to uncertainty regarding the particular selenium species contributing to overall exposure. In addition, unmeasured confounding from lifestyle or nutritional factors - a major and well-known source of bias in nutritional epidemiology studies of observational design - could have been present. Therefore, the internal validity of these studies is limited.
Currently, the hypothesis that increasing selenium intake may reduce cancer risk is not supported by epidemiological evidence. Additional research is needed to assess whether selenium may affect the risk of cancer in individuals with specific genetic backgrounds or nutritional status, and to determine how the various chemical forms of selenium compounds may have different effects on cancer risk.",1025,Selenium; cancer incidence; cancer mortality; site-specific cancers; melanoma; high-grade prostate cancer; type 2 diabetes; genetic factors,How do observational studies and randomised trials differ in their findings on selenium exposure and cancer?,Critically judge the hypothesis that increasing selenium intake reduces cancer risk.,Select all of the following that are colors,What was the primary aim of the reviewed study?,What inference about selenium supplementation and prostate cancer was made in the trials?,"Observational studies suggest an inverse relationship, while randomised trials show no effect.; Both observational studies and randomised trials suggest selenium reduces cancer risk.; Observational studies show a direct relationship, but randomised trials confirm no effect.","Observational studies suggest an inverse relationship, while randomised trials show no effect.",The hypothesis is supported by high-quality randomised trials.; The hypothesis is not supported by epidemiological evidence.; The hypothesis remains untested due to lack of trials.,The hypothesis is not supported by epidemiological evidence.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,To determine the nutritional benefits of selenium for cancer prevention.; To investigate the relationship between selenium intake and cancer prevention.; To compare selenium with other nutritional supplements.,To investigate the relationship between selenium intake and cancer prevention.,Selenium supplementation might increase the risk of high-grade prostate cancer.; Selenium supplementation definitely prevents prostate cancer.; Selenium has no impact on prostate cancer risk.,Selenium supplementation might increase the risk of high-grade prostate cancer.
64345edc0fd9813bdd9ef181,finetuned_6,D-dimer for excluding pulmonary embolism in hospital outpatient and accident and emergency populations,"Pulmonary embolism (PE) occurs when a blood clot travels through the bloodstream and becomes lodged in the arteries of the lungs, blocking blood flow. People are more likely to develop PE if they have cancer, have recently undergone surgery, have been immobile for long periods, or are pregnant. Symptoms can vary but often include sudden shortness of breath, chest pain, and rapid breathing. Because these symptoms are common and can be caused by many conditions, accurate and efficient testing is important. D-dimers are small protein fragments released into the blood when the body breaks down a blood clot. The D-dimer test is widely used because it is quick, simple, inexpensive, and helps rule out venous thromboembolism (VTE), including PE. A normal D-dimer level makes the presence of a new blood clot very unlikely, helping avoid the need for more expensive or invasive imaging tests. This review assessed how well the D-dimer test can rule out acute PE in adults seen in outpatient clinics or emergency departments. All patients in the included studies had their pre-test probability (PTP) of PE determined using a clinical prediction rule (CPR), and none were already taking anticoagulants. The review included cross-sectional studies that compared D-dimer testing with established imaging standards such as ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scans, CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA), selective pulmonary angiography, or magnetic resonance pulmonary angiography (MRPA). D-dimer methods included quantitative, semi-quantitative, and qualitative assays. Four studies involving 1585 participants met the inclusion criteria. None were judged to be at high risk of bias, although some methodological details were unclear. Across all studies, D-dimer tests showed consistently high sensitivity meaning they correctly identified most people with PE with sensitivity ranging from 80% to 100%. However, specificity was low (23% to 63%), resulting in many false-positive results, especially among adults over 65 years old. This means that while a normal D-dimer level strongly suggests the absence of PE, an elevated D-dimer level is common and not specific to PE, often prompting further testing. Overall, the evidence shows that a negative D-dimer result is a reliable way to rule out PE in patients who have a low pre-test probability. One study suggested that the test may be less helpful in older adults because D-dimer levels tend to rise naturally with age, but there is currently no direct evidence supporting the use of higher diagnostic thresholds for people over 65. More research is needed to determine whether age-adjusted thresholds improve accuracy without increasing risk.","To investigate the ability of the D-dimer test to rule out a diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients treated in hospital outpatient and accident and emergency (A&E) departments.
Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a serious, potentially fatal condition that occurs when a blood clot becomes lodged in the blood vessels of the lungs. When people arrive to hospital A&E departments reporting difficulty breathing, breathlessness and chest pain, several explanations are possible but a quick diagnosis is needed. Tests that are available to detect blood clots in the lungs can be invasive and time-consuming, can carry a radiation burden and may be costly. Quick, easy-to-use and inexpensive tests that can be used to rule out the diagnosis would be very valuable.
One such test is the D-dimer test, which is so named because it detects small pieces of protein in the blood, which are called D-dimer. When someone with symptoms of breathlessness and chest pain arrives to the hospital A&E department, the staff conducts an examination and asks questions about the patient's medical history and lifestyle. This helps them to calculate a score for the patient's risk that symptoms are due to a PE.
If the score shows that they are at high risk of a blood clot in the lungs, patients undergo diagnostic scanning immediately (or are treated while test results are awaited). A D-dimer test can be ordered for people in low or moderate (or unlikely) risk groups; a negative D-dimer result might rule out the diagnosis of PE without the need for imaging.
This review considered all evidence provided by studies that assess the ability of D-dimer to rule out PE in people attending hospital outpatient and A&E departments.
We assessed all available reports from a wide search of databases of medical literature. Two review authors independently assessed studies that met the review criteria, including use of a study design called a cross-sectional study; inclusion of people with symptoms of PE who attended hospital outpatient and A&E departments; use of a risk score and then a D-dimer test; and comparison of results of the D-dimer test against the results of the very best available tests - ventilation/perfusion scanning (V/Q scanning), pulmonary angiography, computerised tomography pulmonary angiography, and magnetic resonance pulmonary angiography.
The flow of patients and the timing of D-dimer and reference standard tests were of greatest methodological concern; no study authors provided a flow diagram to show the flow of patients throughout their study, and only one study clearly reported the time between administration of index and reference standard tests. In the remaining three studies, timing between conduct of the index test and completion of the reference standard was not clearly reported, leading to an unclear classification of bias.
Limited evidence from the studies included in this review suggests that quantitative D-dimer tests used in emergency departments have few false-negatives but very high levels of false-positive results, with a high level of sensitivity consistently evident across all age groups. This makes the test useful as a rule-out test but means that a positive result requires diagnostic imaging.",1051,Pulmonary embolism; D-dimer; pre-test probability; ventilation/perfusion scans; CT pulmonary angiography; selective pulmonary angiography; magnetic resonance pulmonary angiography; sensitivity; specificity,How do the motivations for conducting the D-dimer test studies reflect the challenges faced in diagnosing pulmonary embolism in emergency settings?,How can the high sensitivity but low specificity of the D-dimer test be organized into a diagnostic approach for ruling out PE?,Select all of the following that are colors,How is sensitivity of the D-dimer test described across different age groups?,What is the primary reason for conducting further diagnostic imaging after a positive D-dimer test result?,The studies aim to reduce the need for invasive and costly tests in emergency settings.; The studies aim to establish a higher diagnostic threshold for older adults.; The studies aim to exclusively use quantitative methods for D-dimer testing.,The studies aim to reduce the need for invasive and costly tests in emergency settings.,"Use the D-dimer test to rule out PE in low-risk patients, followed by imaging for positive results.; Apply the D-dimer test only after imaging has been completed.; Ignore the D-dimer test results unless the patient is under 40 years of age.","Use the D-dimer test to rule out PE in low-risk patients, followed by imaging for positive results.",blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,High sensitivity across all age groups; Low sensitivity in young adults; Inconsistent sensitivity,High sensitivity across all age groups,The D-dimer test has high levels of false positives; To confirm the presence of cancer; To estimate lung capacity,The D-dimer test has high levels of false positives
64345edc0fd9813bdd9ef181,finetuned_6,Does personalised advice via computer or mobile devices reduce heavy drinking?,"Excessive alcohol use contributes significantly to physical and psychological illness, injury and death, and a wide array of social harm in all age groups. A proven strategy for reducing excessive alcohol consumption levels is to offer a brief conversation-based intervention in primary care settings, but more recent technological innovations have enabled people to interact directly via computer, mobile device or smartphone with digital interventions designed to address problem alcohol consumption. To assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of digital interventions for reducing hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption, alcohol-related problems, or both, in people living in the community, specifically: (i) Are digital interventions more effective and cost-effective than no intervention (or minimal input) controls? (ii) Are digital interventions at least equally effective as face-to-face brief alcohol interventions? (iii) What are the effective component behaviour change techniques (BCTs) of such interventions and their mechanisms of action? (iv) What theories or models have been used in the development and/or evaluation of the intervention? Secondary objectives were (i) to assess whether outcomes differ between trials where the digital intervention targets participants attending health, social care, education or other community-based settings and those where it is offered remotely via the internet or mobile phone platforms; (ii) to specify interventions according to their mode of delivery (e.g. functionality features) and assess the impact of mode of delivery on outcomes. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ERIC, HTA and Web of Knowledge databases; ClinicalTrials.com and WHO ICTRP trials registers and relevant websites to April 2017. We also checked the reference lists of included trials and relevant systematic reviews. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effectiveness of digital interventions compared with no intervention or with face-to-face interventions for reducing hazardous or harmful alcohol consumption in people living in the community and reported a measure of alcohol consumption. We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. We included 57 studies which randomised a total of 34,390 participants. The main sources of bias were from attrition and participant blinding (36% and 21% of studies respectively, high risk of bias). Forty one studies (42 comparisons, 19,241 participants) provided data for the primary meta-analysis, which demonstrated that participants using a digital intervention drank approximately 23 g alcohol weekly (95% CI 15 to 30) (about 3 UK units) less than participants who received no or minimal interventions at end of follow up (moderate-quality evidence). Fifteen studies (16 comparisons, 10,862 participants) demonstrated that participants who engaged with digital interventions had less than one drinking day per month fewer than no intervention controls (moderate-quality evidence), 15 studies (3587 participants) showed about one binge drinking session less per month in the intervention group compared to no intervention controls (moderate-quality evidence), and in 15 studies (9791 participants) intervention participants drank one unit per occasion less than no intervention control participants (moderate-quality evidence). Only five small studies (390 participants) compared digital and face-to-face interventions. There was no difference in alcohol consumption at end of follow up (MD 0.52 g/week, 95% CI -24.59 to 25.63; low-quality evidence). Thus, digital alcohol interventions produced broadly similar outcomes in these studies. No studies reported whether any adverse effects resulted from the interventions. A median of nine BCTs were used in experimental arms (range = 1 to 22). 'B' is an estimate of effect (MD in quantity of drinking, expressed in g/week) per unit increase in the BCT, and is a way to report whether individual BCTs are linked to the effect of the intervention. The BCTs of goal setting (B -43.94, 95% CI -78.59 to -9.30), problem solving (B -48.03, 95% CI -77.79 to -18.27), information about antecedents (B -74.20, 95% CI -117.72 to -30.68), behaviour substitution (B -123.71, 95% CI -184.63 to -62.80) and credible source (B -39.89, 95% CI -72.66 to -7.11) were significantly associated with reduced alcohol consumption in unadjusted models. In a multivariable model that included BCTs with B > 23 in the unadjusted model, the BCTs of behaviour substitution (B -95.12, 95% CI -162.90 to -27.34), problem solving (B -45.92, 95% CI -90.97 to -0.87), and credible source (B -32.09, 95% CI -60.64 to -3.55) were associated with reduced alcohol consumption. The most frequently mentioned theories or models in the included studies were Motivational Interviewing Theory (7/20), Transtheoretical Model (6/20) and Social Norms Theory (6/20). Over half of the interventions (n = 21, 51%) made no mention of theory. Only two studies used theory to select participants or tailor the intervention. There was no evidence of an association between reporting theory use and intervention effectiveness. There is moderate-quality evidence that digital interventions may lower alcohol consumption, with an average reduction of up to three (UK) standard drinks per week compared to control participants. Substantial heterogeneity and risk of performance and publication bias may mean the reduction was lower. Low-quality evidence from fewer studies suggested there may be little or no difference in impact on alcohol consumption between digital and face-to-face interventions. The BCTs of behaviour substitution, problem solving and credible source were associated with the effectiveness of digital interventions to reduce alcohol consumption and warrant further investigation in an experimental context. Reporting of theory use was very limited and often unclear when present. Over half of the interventions made no reference to any theories. Limited reporting of theory use was unrelated to heterogeneity in intervention effectiveness.","We aimed to find out if personalised advice to reduce heavy drinking provided using a computer or mobile device is better than nothing or printed information. We also compared advice provided using a computer or mobile device to advice given in a face-to-face conversation. The main outcome was how much alcohol people drank.
Heavy drinking causes over 60 diseases, as well as many accidents, injuries and early deaths each year. Brief advice or counselling, delivered by doctors or nurses, can help people reduce their drinking by around 4 to 5 units a week. In the UK, this is around two pints (1.13 L) of beer or half a bottle of wine (375 mL) each week. However, people may be embarrassed by talking about alcohol. The studies included people in workplaces, colleges or health clinics and internet users. Everyone typed information about their drinking into a computer or mobile device - which then gave half the people advice about how much they drank and the effect this has on health. This group also received suggestions about how to cut down on drinking. The other group could sometimes read general health information. Between one month and one year later, everyone was asked to confirm how much they were drinking. Drinking levels in both groups were compared to each other at these time points. Many (56%) studies were funded by government or research foundation funds. Some (11%) were funded by personal awards such as PhD fellowships. The rest did not report sources of funding. We included 57 studies comparing the drinking of people getting advice about alcohol from computers or mobile devices with those who did not after one to 12 months. Of these, 41 studies (42 comparisons, 19,241 participants) focused on the actual amounts that people reported drinking each week. Most people reported drinking less if they received advice about alcohol from a computer or mobile device compared to people who did not get this advice. Evidence shows that the amount of alcohol people cut down may be about 1.5 pints (800 mL) of beer or a third of a bottle of wine (250 mL) each week. Other measures supported the effectiveness of digital alcohol interventions, although the size of the effect tended to be smaller than for overall alcohol consumption. Positive differences in measures of drinking were seen at 1, 6 and 12 months after the advice. There was not enough information to help us decide if advice was better from computers, telephones or the internet to reduce risky drinking. We do not know which pieces of advice were the most important to help people reduce problem drinking. However, advice from trusted people such as doctors seemed helpful, as did recommendations that people think about specific ways they could overcome problems that might prevent them from drinking less and suggestions about things to do instead of drinking. We included five studies which compared the drinking of people who got advice from computers or mobile devices with advice from face-to-face conversations with doctors or nurses; there may be little or no difference between these to reduce heavy drinking. No studies reported whether any harm came from the interventions. Personalised advice using computers or mobile devices may help people reduce heavy drinking better than doing nothing or providing only general health information. Personalised advice through computers or mobile devices may make little or no difference to reduce drinking compared to face-to-face conversation.",1061,brief conversation-based intervention; hazardous alcohol consumption; community-based settings; behavior change techniques; Behavior substitution,What specific behavior change techniques (BCTs) were most strongly associated with the effectiveness of digital interventions?,Which measure was used as a key outcome for assessing digital interventions?,Select the items that are animals,How is the advice delivered through digital interventions typically personalized?,In what way did the results vary when digital interventions were compared with face-to-face advice?,Goal setting and credible source; Behavior substitution and problem-solving; Information about antecedents and behavior substitution,Behavior substitution and problem-solving,How much alcohol people drank; The participants' weight loss; The number of exercise sessions per week,How much alcohol people drank,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,By considering individual drinking habits and health effects; By providing generalized health tips; By sending automated text messages at fixed times,By considering individual drinking habits and health effects,There was little or no difference in effectiveness; Digital was significantly more effective; Face-to-face was significantly more effective,There was little or no difference in effectiveness
612fa6644526903f736cf925,static_1,Biosimilar monoclonal antibodies for cancer treatment in adults,"Biosimilars are products that contain an approved biological medicine and are similar, but not identical, to the original version (the originator). In cancer, biosimilars have been developed from the monoclonal antibodies bevacizumab, rituximab, and trastuzumab, and they are now available for treating lung, colorectal, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and breast cancers. Because biological products cannot be made identically, it is important to evaluate the clinical effects of biosimilars compared with their originators to understand their benefits and harms. We evaluated the benefits and harms of biosimilar monoclonal antibodies versus their originators in adults with cancer. We searched major medical and clinical trial databases up to February 2024 for randomized controlled trials comparing biosimilars to originators. Standard Cochrane methods were used. The primary outcomes were progression-free survival, duration of response, overall survival, pathological complete response in breast cancer, serious adverse events, and health-related quality of life. We included 55 studies with 22,046 adults: 23 studies of bevacizumab involving 10,639 participants with colorectal or lung cancer, 17 studies of rituximab involving 4412 participants with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 15 studies of trastuzumab involving 6995 participants with breast cancer. Studies took place worldwide, were mostly multicentre, and all were funded by manufacturers. Participants ranged in age from 47 to 62 years, and the percentage of women ranged from 18% to 100%. Fifteen studies used non-inferiority designs and 40 used equivalence designs. Overall risk of bias was low, with most concerns related to incomplete outcome data and selective reporting. For bevacizumab in lung or colorectal cancer, progression-free survival was likely similar between biosimilars and originators, with equal numbers per 1000 at 12 months and a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.00. Duration of response and overall survival were also likely similar, and serious adverse events showed no important differences. Health-related quality of life was evaluated in only one colorectal cancer study and results were similar. Objective response and mortality were likely similar as well. For rituximab in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, biosimilars were likely similar to originators for progression-free survival, duration of response, overall survival, serious adverse events, objective response, and mortality. No studies reported quality of life. For trastuzumab in breast cancer, biosimilars were likely similar to originators for progression-free survival, duration of response, overall survival, serious adverse events, and objective response, and may be similar for pathological complete response. No studies reported quality of life. Across bevacizumab, rituximab, and trastuzumab, biosimilars were generally similar to their originators in progression-free survival, duration of response, overall survival, serious adverse events, objective response, and mortality. Evidence for pathological complete response (trastuzumab) and quality of life (bevacizumab) was limited. Overall, evidence certainty was moderate, with imprecision being the main reason for downgrading confidence.","Biological medicines used in cancer treatment are made from living organisms and work by killing cancer cells. Biosimilars are medicines that are similar to the original biological medicine, known as the originator. Although biosimilars have slightly different structures, they target cancer cells in the same way. Originator medicines, sometimes called reference or innovator medicines, receive approval before biosimilars. Unlike generic medicines, which are chemically derived and easier to replicate, originators and biosimilars are biological medicines, making it more difficult to create identical copies. However, biosimilars are often cheaper and could improve access to effective cancer treatment if they provide similar benefits and harms. We wanted to compare the benefits and harms of bevacizumab, rituximab, and trastuzumab biosimilars with their originators. Based on the input from five people with cancer, we considered several outcomes critical for clinical decisions: the length of time cancer does not grow or spread after treatment, the length of time people remain cancer-free, overall survival, the number of people whose breast cancer disappears in tissue removed during surgery, severe unwanted effects, and well-being. We also identified outcomes important for decision-making: the number of people whose cancer shrinks or disappears, death, and the time until cancer grows or spreads or until death. We searched for studies comparing biosimilars of bevacizumab, rituximab, or trastuzumab with the originators in people with lung, colorectal, non-Hodkin's lymphoma, and breast cancers, summarized the results, and rated our confidence in the evidence. We found 55 studies with 22,046 participants, including 10,639 receiving bevacizumab for advanced or metastatic lung cancer, 4412 receiving rituximab mainly for non-Hodkin's lymphoma, and 6995 receiving trastuzumab for advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Participants were 47 to 62 years old on average, and the studies took place across Asia, Europe, and North and South America. All studies were funded by the companies manufacturing the biosimilars. Receiving biosimilars or originator medicines led to similar results overall, and we are moderately confident that biosimilars are as effective as the originators in treating cancer. We set narrow criteria to judge whether results were sufficiently similar, and while most comparisons did not fall fully within this range, overall findings still support similarity. Most studies were well conducted, but a few may have allowed participants to know which treatment they received, and some studies did not report all outcomes of interest.",1018,biosilimars; biological medicine; bevacizumab; rituximab; trastuzumab; progression-free survival; duration of response; overall survival; serious adverse events; health-related quality of life,In what way do biosimilars demonstrate their therapeutic value compared to originators?,How could a decision-maker justify the use of biosimilars in cancer treatment?,Select all of the following that are colors,Name the three monoclonal antibodies mentioned that have biosimilars.,Describe the types of cancer involved in the studies comparing biosimilars and originators.,By showing adequately similar outcomes in critical measures for decision-making.; By providing completely different benefits that improve treatment options.; By achieving perfect replication of all outcomes observed with originators.,By showing adequately similar outcomes in critical measures for decision-making.,By arguing that biosimilars provide a moderate increase in life expectancy.; By highlighting their overall similar effectiveness and lower cost.; By pointing to their identical molecular composition to originators.,By highlighting their overall similar effectiveness and lower cost.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Bevacizumab; Rituximab; Trastuzumab,Bevacizumab; Rituximab; Trastuzumab,"Lung, colorectal, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and breast cancers.; Prostate and skin cancers.; Bone and stomach cancers.","Lung, colorectal, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and breast cancers."
612fa6644526903f736cf925,static_2,Do education programmes improve outcomes in people with both chronic kidney disease and diabetes?,"Adherence to complex regimens for people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes is often poor. Interventions to enhance adherence require intensive education and behavioural counselling. However, whether the existing evidence is scientifically rigorous and can support recommendations for routine use of educational programmes in people with CKD and diabetes is still unknown. This is an update of a review first published in 2011.
To evaluate the benefits and harms of education programmes for people with CKD and diabetes. We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 19 July 2024 using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs investigating the benefits and harms of educational programmes (information and behavioural instructions and advice given by a healthcare provider, who could be a nurse, pharmacist, educator, health professional, medical practitioner, or healthcare provider, through verbal, written, audio-recording, or computer-aided modalities) for people 18 years and older with CKD and diabetes.
Two authors independently screened the literature, determined study eligibility, assessed quality, and extracted and entered data. We expressed dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and continuous data as mean difference (MD) with 95% CI. Data were pooled using the random-effects model. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Eight studies (13 reports, 840 randomised participants) were included. The overall risk of bias was low for objective outcomes and attrition bias, unclear for selection bias, reporting bias and other biases, and high for subjective outcomes. Education programmes compared to routine care alone probably decrease glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) (4 studies, 467 participants: MD -0.42%, 95% CI -0.53 to -0.31; moderate certainty evidence; 13.5 months follow-up) and may decrease total cholesterol (179 participants: MD -0.35 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.63 to -00.07; low certainty evidence) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (179 participants: MD -0.40 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.65 to -0.14; low certainty evidence) at 18 months of follow-up. One study (83 participants) reported education programmes for people receiving dialysis who have diabetes may improve the diabetes knowledge of diagnosis, monitoring, hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia, medication with insulin, oral medication, personal health habits, diet, exercise, chronic complications, and living with diabetes and coping with stress (all low certainty evidence). There may be an improvement in the general knowledge of diabetes at the end of the intervention and at the end of the three-month follow-up (one study, 97 participants; low certainty evidence) in people with diabetes and moderately increased albuminuria (A2). In participants with diabetes and moderately increased albuminuria (A2) (one study, 97 participants), education programmes may improve a participantÃÆÃÆÃâÃÂ¢ÃÆÃâÃâÃâ¬ÃÆÃâÃâÃâ¢s beliefs in treatment effectiveness and total self-efficacy at the end of five weeks compared to routine care (low certainty evidence). Self-efficacy for in-home blood glucose monitoring and beliefs in personal control may increase at the end of the three-month follow-up (low certainty evidence). There were no differences in other self-efficacy measures. One study (100 participants) reported an education programme may increase change in behaviour for general diet, specific diet and home blood glucose monitoring at the end of treatment (low certainty evidence); however, at the end of three months of follow-up, there may be no difference in any behaviour change outcomes (all low certainty evidence). There were uncertain effects on death, serious hypoglycaemia, and kidney failure due to very low certainty evidence. No data was available for changes in kidney function (creatinine clearance, serum creatinine, doubling of serum creatinine or proteinuria). For an education programme plus multidisciplinary, co-ordinated care compared to routine care, there may be little or no difference in HbA1c, kidney failure, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), systolic or diastolic blood pressure, hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia, and LDL and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (all low certainty evidence in participants with type-2 diabetes mellitus and documented advanced diabetic nephropathy). There were no data for death, patient-orientated measures, change in kidney function (other than eGFR and albuminuria), cardiovascular disease morbidity, quality of life, or adverse events. Education programmes may improve knowledge of some areas related to diabetes care and some self-management practices. Education programmes probably decrease HbA1c in people with CKD and diabetes, but the effect on other clinical outcomes is unclear. This review only included eight studies with small sample sizes. Therefore, more randomised studies are needed to examine the efficacy of education programmes on important clinical outcomes in people with CKD and diabetes.","Chronic kidney disease (a long-term condition where the kidneys do not work effectively) and diabetes (a lifelong condition that causes a person's blood sugar level to become too high) are chronic conditions that bring on many challenges for people, particularly when they have to manage both at the same time. Diabetes can accelerate the development of kidney disease and is the leading cause of kidney failure (a condition where the kidneys no longer function well enough to keep a person alive). While sticking to complex treatment plans can be challenging, successful self-management in the early stages of kidney disease can improve outcomes later in life and delay the need for dialysis or a kidney transplant. Education programmes are any set of planned activities designed to improve a person's ability to manage their condition and delay the progression of their kidney disease. These activities can aim to improve a person's knowledge of their disease, self-care activities, and their ability to self-monitor the disease, thus encouraging and motivating them to create healthy lifestyle changes, improve their treatment compliance, and improve quality of life. We wanted to find out whether an education programme designed for people with both kidney disease and diabetes helps them understand their condition and recognise the importance of strategies aimed at slowing its progression and preventing long-term complications. We searched for randomised studies (studies in which participants are assigned randomly to two or more treatment groups) that compared education programmes to usual care for people with both kidney disease and diabetes. We compared and summarised the results and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and sizes.
We included eight studies involving 840 people 18 years or older with both kidney disease and diabetes. Four studies were undertaken in multiple centres, and four studies were performed in single centres. The duration of follow-up ranged from 12 weeks to four years. Most of the education programmes were designed to increase a person's knowledge of their condition and improve self-management behaviours. One study focused on reducing stress using mindfulness (a person's ability to be aware of where they are and what they are doing), and it was adapted to include practices for complex thoughts and feelings related to diabetes, and one study used a co-ordinated medical care approach with multiple practitioners involved in a person's care. Overall, education programmes probably lower blood glucose levels and may lower total cholesterol and blood pressure, but may make little or no difference to kidney function, abnormally low or high blood sugar, and cardiovascular disease (disorders of the heart and blood vessels). For people with diabetes on dialysis (a procedure to remove waste products and excess fluid from the blood when the kidneys stop working properly), an education programme may improve their knowledge of diabetes, self-management behaviour for checking their feet, using lotion, wearing appropriate shoes and socks, and coping with stress. For people with moderately increased protein in the urine, there may be an improvement in their general knowledge of diabetes, their confidence in monitoring their blood sugar levels at home, their beliefs in their personal control, as well as behavioural changes to their diet. There may be no behavioural changes to exercise, foot care, or quitting smoking.
We have low confidence in education programmes improving the understanding of diabetes in people with kidney disease. This is because the number of studies reporting outcomes of interest was low, and the education programmes varied, so we were unable to properly analyse the results.",1082,Chronic kidney disease; HbA1c; Low-density lipoprotein; Moderately increased albuminuria; Education programmes; Multi-disciplinary coordinated care; Estimated glomerular filtration rate; Hyperglycaemia; Diabetic nephropathy; Self-efficacy,Which factors may influence the validity of the education programme outcomes in the study?,What criteria were used to determine the study's confidence in the evidence of educational programme outcomes?,Select all of the following that are fruits,Evaluate the potential limitations of the study's findings on education programmes.,What effect do education programmes have on self-monitoring practices?,Variability in programme design and delivery.; Limited participant age range.; Inconsistent follow-up durations.,Variability in programme design and delivery.; Inconsistent follow-up durations.,Study methods and sizes.; Geographic diversity of centres.; Participant demographics.,Study methods and sizes.,dog; blue; grape,grape,Limited number of studies and participants.; Inconsistent reporting of follow-up data.; Variety in educational programme approaches.,Limited number of studies and participants.; Variety in educational programme approaches.,They may improve confidence in home blood sugar monitoring.; They may decrease interest in self-monitoring.; They significantly improve kidney function.,They may improve confidence in home blood sugar monitoring.
612fa6644526903f736cf925,static_2,What are the benefits and risks of cognitive rehabilitation for people with mild-to-moderate dementia?,"Cognitive impairments affect functional ability in people with dementia. Cognitive rehabilitation (CR) is a personalised, solution-focused approach that aims to enable people with mild-to-moderate dementia to manage everyday activities and maintain as much independence as possible. To evaluate the effects of CR on everyday functioning and other outcomes for people with mild-to-moderate dementia, and on outcomes for care partners. To identify and explore factors that may be associated with the efficacy of CR. We searched the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialised Register, which contains records from MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, LILACS, and other clinical trial databases, and grey literature sources. The most recent search was completed on 19 October 2022. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing CR with control conditions and reporting relevant outcomes for the person with dementia and/or the care partner. We extracted relevant data from published manuscripts and contacted trial authors if necessary. Within each of the comparisons, we pooled data for each outcome of interest and conducted inverse-variance, random-effects meta-analyses. We evaluated the certainty of the evidence using GRADEpro GDT. We identified six eligible RCTs published in English between 2010 and 2022, which together included 1702 participants. The mean age of participants ranged from 76 to 80 and the proportion of male participants was between 29.4% and 79.3%. Most participants, in the studies where the type of dementia was reported, had a diagnosis of Alzheimers disease (AD; n = 1002, 58.9% of the whole sample, 81.2% of the participants for whom the specific diagnosis was reported). Risk of bias in the individual studies was relatively low. The exception was a high risk of bias in relation to blinding of participants and practitioners, which is not usually feasible with psychosocial interventions. Our primary outcome of everyday functioning was operationalised in the included studies as goal attainment in relation to activities targeted in the intervention. For our main comparison of CR with usual care, we pooled data for goal attainment evaluated from three perspectives (self-rating of performance, informant rating of performance, and self-rating of satisfaction with performance) at end of treatment and at medium-term follow-up (3 to 12 months). We could also pool data at these time points for 20 and 19 secondary outcomes respectively. The review findings were strongly driven by one large, high-quality RCT. We found high-certainty evidence of large positive effects of CR on all three primary outcome perspectives at the end of treatment: participant self-ratings of goal attainment (standardised mean difference (SMD) 1.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.26 to 1.66; I2 = 0%; 3 RCTs, 501 participants), informant ratings of goal attainment (SMD 1.61, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.21; I2 = 41%; 3 RCTs, 476 participants), and self-ratings of satisfaction with goal attainment (SMD 1.31, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.54; I2 = 5%; 3 RCTs, 501 participants), relative to an inactive control condition. At medium-term follow-up, we found high-certainty evidence showing a large positive effect of CR on all three primary outcome perspectives: participant self-ratings of goal attainment (SMD 1.46, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.68; I2 = 0%; 2 RCTs, 432 participants), informant ratings of goal attainment (SMD 1.25, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.72; I2 = 29%; 3 RCTs, 446 participants), and self-ratings of satisfaction with goal attainment (SMD 1.19, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.66; I2 = 28%; 2 RCTs, 432 participants), relative to an inactive control condition. For participants at the end of treatment we found high-certainty evidence showing a small positive effect of CR on self-efficacy (2 RCTs, 456 participants) and immediate recall (2 RCTs, 459 participants). For participants at medium-term follow-up we found moderate-certainty evidence showing a small positive effect of CR on auditory selective attention (2 RCTs, 386 participants), and a small negative effect on general functional ability (3 RCTs, 673 participants), and we found low-certainty evidence showing a small positive effect on sustained attention (2 RCTs, 413 participants), and a small negative effect on memory (2 RCTs, 51 participants) and anxiety (3 RCTs, 455 participants). We found moderate- and low-certainty evidence indicating that at the end of treatment CR had negligible effects on participant anxiety, quality of life, sustained attention, memory, delayed recall, and general functional ability, and at medium-term follow-up on participant self-efficacy, depression, quality of life, immediate recall, and verbal fluency. For care partners at the end of treatment we found low-certainty evidence showing a small positive effect on environmental aspects of quality of life (3 RCTs, 465 care partners), and small negative effects of CR on level of depression (2 RCTs, 32 care partners) and on psychological wellbeing (2 RCTs, 388 care partners). For care partners at medium-term follow-up we found high-certainty evidence showing a small positive effect of CR on social aspects of quality of life (3 RCTs, 436 care partners) and moderate-certainty evidence showing a small positive effect on psychological aspects of quality of life (3 RCTs, 437 care partners). We found moderate- and low-certainty evidence at the end of treatment that CR had negligible effects on care partners physical health, psychological and social aspects of quality of life, and stress, and at medium-term follow-up for the physical health aspect of care partners quality of life and psychological wellbeing. CR is helpful in enabling people with mild or moderate dementia to improve their ability to manage the everyday activities targeted in the intervention. Confidence in these findings could be strengthened if more high-quality studies contributed to the observed effects. The available evidence suggests that CR can form a valuable part of a clinical toolkit to assist people with dementia in overcoming some of the everyday barriers imposed by cognitive and functional difficulties. Future research, including process evaluation studies, could help identify avenues to maximise CR effects and achieve wider impacts on functional ability and wellbeing.","Dementia is a group of symptoms caused by changes in the brain that get worse over time. People with some types of dementia have difficulties with memory, planning, concentrating, and communicating. These and other thinking difficulties are collectively described by the umbrella term, 'cognitive impairment'. Cognitive impairment makes it harder to do daily activities and stay independent for as long as possible.
Cognitive rehabilitation is a personalised intervention. People have one-to-one sessions with a practitioner, usually in their own home. People identify everyday activities and tasks that they would like to manage better or do more independently. The practitioner suggests strategies and works with them to help achieve these improvements in the activities that are important to them. Family members are often involved as well.
We explored whether cognitive rehabilitation was better than usual treatment for: doing a chosen task or activity that matters to the person; managing daily activities; feeling confident about being able to manage things; feeling depressed or anxious; having a sense of wellbeing. We also explored whether cognitive rehabilitation was better for ensuring the wellbeing of the care partner - usually a husband, wife, or other close family member.
We searched for studies that rigorously tested the effects of cognitive rehabilitation for people with mild-to-moderate dementia. In these studies, some people had their usual treatment and others had their usual treatment plus cognitive rehabilitation. This made it possible to see whether cognitive rehabilitation was more helpful than usual treatment alone. We compared and summarised the results of the studies. We rated our confidence in the evidence the studies provided, based on the methods used and the numbers of people involved. We found six studies. They involved 1702 people with mild-to-moderate dementia, who had between 8 and 14 sessions with a cognitive rehabilitation practitioner. Alzheimers disease was the most common dementia diagnosis (59% of all participants, 82% of participants with the specific diagnosis reported).
The main findings are that, compared to people who just had their usual treatment, people who had cognitive rehabilitation got better at doing their chosen tasks or activities.
This improvement was seen by the people with dementia and by their care partners. The improvement was seen straight after cognitive rehabilitation and was still noticeable 3 to 12 months later.
Straight after cognitive rehabilitation, compared to people who just had their usual treatment, people with dementia may feel more confident about how they are managing.
There might not be any differences in the wellbeing of people with dementia and their care partners. We are not sure if there are any differences for people with dementia in managing other tasks or activities or in feeling depressed. Three to 12 months after cognitive rehabilitation, compared to usual treatment, care partners may have better psychological wellbeing.
There may not be any differences in how well people with dementia manage other tasks or activities, in how confident or depressed they feel, or in their wellbeing.
Our review included six studies, but the findings are based mostly on information from one large study. We do not know if the effects of cognitive rehabilitation last more than a year.

612fa6644526903f736cf925,interactive_3,Rivastigmine for people with Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer's disease is the commonest cause of dementia affecting older people. One of the therapeutic strategies aimed at ameliorating the clinical manifestations of Alzheimer's disease is to enhance cholinergic neurotransmission in the brain by the use of cholinesterase inhibitors to delay the breakdown of acetylcholine released into synaptic clefts. Tacrine, the first of the cholinesterase inhibitors to undergo extensive trials for this purpose, was associated with significant adverse effects including hepatotoxicity. Other cholinesterase inhibitors, including rivastigmine, with superior properties in terms of specificity of action and lower risk of adverse effects have since been introduced. Rivastigmine has received approval for use in 60 countries including all member states of the European Union and the USA. To determine the clinical efficacy and safety of rivastigmine for patients with dementia of Alzheimer's type. We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialized Register, on 2 March 2015 using the terms: Rivastigmine OR exelon OR ENA OR ""SDZ ENA 713"". ALOIS contains records of clinical trials identified from monthly searches of a number of major healthcare databases (Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS), numerous trial registries and grey literature sources. We included all unconfounded, double-blind, randomised, controlled trials in which treatment with rivastigmine was administered to patients with dementia of the Alzheimer's type for 12 weeks or more and its effects compared with those of placebo in a parallel group of patients, or where two formulations of rivastigmine were compared. One review author (JSB) applied the study selection criteria, assessed the quality of studies and extracted data. A total of 13 trials met the inclusion criteria of the review. The trials had a duration of between 12 and 52 weeks. The older trials tested a capsule form with a dose of up to 12 mg/day. Trials reported since 2007 have tested continuous dose transdermal patch formulations delivering 4.6, 9.5 and 17.7 mg/day. Our main analysis compared the safety and efficacy of rivastigmine 6 to 12 mg/day orally or 9.5 mg/day transdermally with placebo. Seven trials contributed data from 3450 patients to this analysis. Data from another two studies were not included because of a lack of information and methodological concerns. All the included trials were multicentre trials and recruited patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease with a mean age of about 75 years. All had low risk of bias for randomisation and allocation but the risk of bias due to attrition was unclear in four studies, low in one study and high in two studies. After 26 weeks of treatment rivastigmine compared to placebo was associated with better outcomes for cognitive function measured with the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-Cog) score (mean difference (MD) -1.79; 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.21 to -1.37, n = 3232, 6 studies) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score (MD 0.74; 95% CI 0.52 to 0.97, n = 3205, 6 studies), activities of daily living (SMD 0.20; 95% CI 0.13 to 0.27, n = 3230, 6 studies) and clinician rated global impression of changes, with a smaller proportion of patients treated with rivastigmine experiencing no change or a deterioration (OR 0.68; 95% CI 0.58 to 0.80, n = 3338, 7 studies). Three studies reported behavioural change, and there were no differences compared to placebo (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.04; 95% CI -0.14 to 0.06, n = 1529, 3 studies). Only one study measured the impact on caregivers using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Caregiver Distress (NPI-D) scale and this found no difference between the groups (MD 0.10; 95% CI -0.91 to 1.11, n = 529, 1 study). Overall, participants who received rivastigmine were about twice as likely to withdraw from the trials (odds ratio (OR) 2.01, 95% CI 1.71 to 2.37, n = 3569, 7 studies) or to experience an adverse event during the trials (OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.82 to 2.57, n = 3587, 7 studies). Rivastigmine (6 to 12 mg daily orally or 9.5 mg daily transdermally) appears to be beneficial for people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. In comparisons with placebo, better outcomes were observed for rate of decline of cognitive function and activities of daily living, although the effects were small and of uncertain clinical importance. There was also a benefit from rivastigmine on the outcome of clinician's global assessment. There were no differences between the rivastigmine group and placebo group in behavioural change or impact on carers. At these doses the transdermal patch may have fewer side effects than the capsules but has comparable efficacy. The quality of evidence is only moderate for all of the outcomes reviewed because of a risk of bias due to dropouts. ","Alzheimer's disease is the commonest cause of dementia affecting older people. As the disease progresses, people lose the ability to remember, communicate, think clearly and perform the usual daily activities. Their behaviour or personality may also change. In severe Alzheimer's disease, the patients lose the ability to care for themselves and require full time care. Currently, there is no cure available for Alzheimer's disease, but a few pharmacological interventions are available to alleviate symptoms. The symptoms are caused by the loss of a type of nerve cell in the brain called cholinergic neurons. Rivastigmine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, works by increasing the levels of a brain chemical called acetylcholine which allows the nerve cells to communicate. This may improve the symptoms of dementia. Rivastigmine can be taken orally, either as capsules or a liquid, or by applying a patch on the skin. Its effectiveness in improving the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and safety were evaluated in this review.This review included double-blinded randomised controlled trials, and the evidence was searched for up to March 2015 using the standard Cochrane methods. The review included studies conducted for at least 12 weeks that compared the safety and effectiveness of rivastigmine compared with placebo. Thirteen studies that met these criteria were found. Most of these studies involved people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease with an average age of around 75 years. The quality of the evidence for most of the outcomes reviewed was moderate. The main factors affecting our confidence in the results included relatively high number of patients dropping out in some of the trials (the rates of dropout in the rivastigmine arms were higher). There were also concerns about the applicability of the evidence for the long term treatment of Alzheimer's disease since data from double-blinded randomised controlled trials were only available for up to 12 months. All the data included in the main analysis of this review came from studies either sponsored or funded by the drug manufacturer (Novartis Pharma).",1128,Alzheimer's disease; cholinergic neurotransmission; cholinesterase inhibitors; acetylcholine; hepatotoxicity; rivastigmine; transdermal patch; activities of daily living; attrition,"In terms of study design, how could future investigations improve upon the current evidence regarding rivastigmine?",What conclusions can be drawn about the benefits of rivastigmine in terms of patient behavior?,Select all of the following that are colors,What is the main purpose of using rivastigmine in Alzheimer's disease?,Summarize the main findings regarding the efficacy of rivastigmine.,Include more diverse patient populations for broader applicability.; Focus solely on short-term effects to enhance result precision.; Implement measures to reduce dropout rates.,Include more diverse patient populations for broader applicability.; Implement measures to reduce dropout rates.,Rivastigmine leads to significant improvements in behavior compared to placebo.; There are no observable differences between rivastigmine and placebo in behavioral changes.; Behavioral improvements are the primary benefit of rivastigmine.,There are no observable differences between rivastigmine and placebo in behavioral changes.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,To cure Alzheimer's disease; To alleviate symptoms of dementia; To increase the production of neurons,To alleviate symptoms of dementia,Rivastigmine significantly improved cognitive functions.; Rivastigmine halted the progression of Alzheimer's.; Rivastigmine showed no differences compared to placebo.,Rivastigmine significantly improved cognitive functions.
612fa6644526903f736cf925,interactive_4,Long-term treatment for people with persistent depression,"Persistent depressive disorder (PDD) is defined as a depressive disorder with a minimum illness duration of two years, including four diagnostic subgroups (dysthymia, chronic major depression, recurrent major depression with incomplete remission between episodes, and double depression), and persistent forms of depression represent a substantial proportion of depressive disorders, with a lifetime prevalence ranging from 3% to 6% in the Western world; growing evidence indicates that PDD responds well to several acute interventions, such as combined psychological and pharmacological treatments, yet given the high rates of relapse and recurrences of depression following response to acute treatment, long-term continuation and maintenance therapy are of great importance, and to date there has been no evidence synthesis available on continuation and maintenance treatments of PDDs. The aim of this review was to assess the effects of pharmacological and psychological (either alone or combined) continuation and maintenance treatments for persistent depressive disorder, in comparison with each other, placebo (drug/attention placebo/non-specific treatment control), and treatment as usual (TAU), with continuation treatments defined as treatments given to currently remitted people (remission is defined as depressive symptoms dropping below case level) or to people who previously responded to an antidepressant treatment, and maintenance therapy given during recovery (defined as remission lasting longer than six months). We searched Ovid MEDLINE (1950- ), Embase (1974- ), PsycINFO (1967- ) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to 28 September 2018, with an earlier search of these databases also conducted via the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trial Register (CCMD-CTR) to 11 December 2015; in addition we searched grey literature resources, ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP to 28 September 2018, screened reference lists of included studies, and contacted the first author of included studies. We included randomized (RCTs) and non-randomized controlled trials (NRCTs) in adults with formally diagnosed PDD, receiving pharmacological, psychological, or combined continuation and maintenance interventions. Two review authors independently selected studies and extracted and analyzed data; the primary efficacy outcome was relapse/recurrence rate of depression, and the primary acceptance outcome was dropout due to any reason other than relapse/recurrence; we performed random-effects meta-analyses using risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We included 10 studies (seven RCTs, three NRCTs) involving 840 participants, with five studies investigating continuation treatments and five investigating maintenance treatments; overall, the included studies were at low-to-moderate risk of bias, with the most common source of risk of bias in NRCTs being selection of reported results, and in RCTs non-blinding of outcome assessment and other bias (especially conflict of interest due to pharmaceutical sponsoring). The most common comparison was antidepressant medication versus tablet placebo (five studies), and participants taking antidepressant medication were probably less likely to relapse or to experience a recurrent episode compared to participants in the placebo group at the end of the intervention (13.9% versus 33.8%, RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.79; participants = 383; studies = 4;  I²  = 54%, moderate quality evidence); overall dropout rates may be similar between participants in the medication and placebo group (23.0% versus 25.5%, RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.39 to 2.11; RCTs = 4; participants = 386;  I²  = 64%, low quality evidence), although sensitivity analyses showed that the primary outcome (rate of relapse/recurrence) showed no evidence of a difference between groups when only including studies with low risk of bias. None of the studies compared pharmacological or psychological treatments versus TAU. One study compared psychological therapies versus attention placebo/non-specific control, and one study compared psychotherapy with medication; the results of the studies including psychotherapy might indicate that continued or maintained psychotherapy could be a useful intervention compared to no treatment or antidepressant medication, but the body of evidence for these comparisons was too small and uncertain to draw high quality conclusions. Three studies compared combined psychological and pharmacological therapies with pharmacological therapies alone, and one study compared combined psychological and pharmacological therapies with psychotherapeutic therapies alone; however, the evidence was too small and uncertain to draw any high quality conclusions. Two studies reported data on the direct comparison of two antidepressants, but again the evidence was too small and uncertain to draw conclusions. Currently, it is uncertain whether continued or maintained pharmacotherapy (or both) with the reviewed antidepressant agents is a robust treatment for preventing relapse and recurrence in people with PDD due to moderate or high risk of bias as well as clinical heterogeneity in the analyzed studies; for all other comparisons, the body of evidence was too small to draw any final conclusions, although continued or maintained psychotherapy might be effective compared to no treatment. There is a need for more high quality trials of psychological interventions, and further studies should address health-related quality of life and adverse events more precisely, as well as assessing follow-up data.","Depressive disorders that persist for at least two years cause considerable problems; even after successful treatment, they frequently recur, and common treatments are antidepressant medicines and psychological treatments (talking therapies), or a combination of both, with long-term treatments intended to prevent the recurrence of depressive symptoms. People with persisting depression (longer than two years), friends, families, and carers, as well as general practitioners, psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, psychological therapists, and pharmacists, will be interested in this review. In adults with persistent depression who improved with acute (short-term) treatment, the review aimed to determine whether receiving continued antidepressant medicine, psychological treatment, or a combination of both is more effective in preventing recurrence of depression compared to placebo (a pretended treatment) or care as usual; whether receiving continued antidepressant medicine, psychological treatment, or a combination of both is equally accepted as receiving placebo or usual care; and whether one treatment is more effective or more accepted than another. We searched medical databases and other sources to find all relevant studies completed up to September 2018, and the studies had to compare antidepressant treatment, psychological treatment, or a combination of both, with each other, with placebo, or with care as usual for preventing recurrence of depression in adults diagnosed with persistent depression; we included 10 studies involving 840 participants. Five studies compared antidepressant medicine with placebo; one study compared psychological therapies versus attention placebo/non-specific control; one study compared psychotherapy with medication; three studies compared combined psychological and pharmacological therapies with pharmacological therapies alone; one study compared combined psychological and pharmacological therapies with psychotherapeutic therapies alone; and two studies compared two different antidepressants with each other. Overall, the included studies were at low-to-moderate risk of bias. According to GRADE, there was moderate quality evidence that participants taking medication treatment probably had less relapses/recurrences and may have lower dropouts than those taking placebo; the risk of depression returning in participants receiving a placebo (instead of antidepressant medicine) was 34%, whereas participants who remained on antidepressant medicines had a lower risk for recurrence of 13%, with continued treatment lasting between four months and two years. Antidepressants were as well accepted as placebo; however, as most of the included studies showed risk of bias and there were some inconsistent results between the different studies, it cannot be concluded with certainty whether continued or maintained pharmacotherapy (or both) is a convincing treatment for people with PDD. Additionally, as studies on the long-term effects of medication are lacking, recommendations on the necessary duration of medication treatment cannot be drawn. The benefits of psychological therapies or combined treatment remained unclear due to the small number of studies. This review cannot provide clear, certain evidence regarding whether continued antidepressant medication (compared to placebo tablet) reduces the risk of depression recurring in adults with persistent depression; however, only a few studies have been done, and further studies should especially address psychological and combined long-term treatments.",1116,Persistent depressive disorder; acute interventions; remission; continuation and maintenance therapy; psychotherapy,What might be the implications of the study's findings for the long-term management of persistent depressive disorder (PDD)?,What is the primary focus of the study?,Select all of the following that are fruits,Which treatments were compared in the study?,How are long-term treatments intended to benefit patients with persistent depression?,Continued antidepressant medication offers a definitive solution to prevent recurrence.; Psychotherapy could potentially be more effective but requires further research.; There is uncertainty regarding the efficacy of combined treatments due to limited data.,Psychotherapy could potentially be more effective but requires further research.; There is uncertainty regarding the efficacy of combined treatments due to limited data.,Assessing continuation and maintenance treatments for persistent depression; Investigating new antidepressant medications; Studying short-term interventions for depression,Assessing continuation and maintenance treatments for persistent depression,dog; blue; grape,grape,Antidepressant medications versus placebo; Psychological therapies versus attention placebo; Lifestyle interventions versus exercise,Antidepressant medications versus placebo; Psychological therapies versus attention placebo,Preventing recurrence of depressive symptoms; Eliminating depressive symptoms completely; Providing immediate relief from symptoms,Preventing recurrence of depressive symptoms
612fa6644526903f736cf925,interactive_4,Case management approaches to home support for people with dementia,"Over 35 million people are estimated to be living with dementia in the world and the societal costs are very high. Case management is a widely used and strongly promoted complex intervention for organising and co-ordinating care at the level of the individual, with the aim of providing long-term care for people with dementia in the community as an alternative to early admission to a care home or hospital. To evaluate the effectiveness of case management approaches to home support for people with dementia, from the perspective of the different people involved (patients, carers, and staff) compared with other forms of treatment, including treatment as usual, standard community treatment and other non-case management interventions. We searched the following databases up to 31 December 2013: ALOIS, the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group, The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, Web of Science (including Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED) and Social Science Citation Index), Campbell Collaboration/SORO database and the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group. We updated this search in March 2014 but results have not yet been incorporated. We include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of case management interventions for people with dementia living in the community and their carers. We screened interventions to ensure that they focused on planning and co-ordination of care. We used standard methodological procedures as required by The Cochrane Collaboration. Two review authors independently extracted data and made 'Risk of bias' assessments using Cochrane criteria. For continuous outcomes, we used the mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) between groups along with its confidence interval (95% CI). We applied a fixed- or random-effects model as appropriate. For binary or dichotomous data, we generated the corresponding odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI. We assessed heterogeneity by the  I² statistic. We include 13 RCTs involving 9615 participants with dementia in the review. Case management interventions in studies varied. We found low to moderate overall risk of bias; 69% of studies were at high risk for performance bias. The case management group were significantly less likely to be institutionalised (admissions to residential or nursing homes) at six months (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.98, n = 5741, 6 RCTs,  I² = 0%, P = 0.02) and at 18 months (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.61, n = 363, 4 RCTs,  I² = 0%, P = 0.003). However, the effects at 10 - 12 months (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.08, n = 5990, 9 RCTs, IÃÆÃÆÃâÃÂ¯ÃÆÃâÃâÃÂ¿ÃÆÃâÃâÃÂ½ = 48%, P = 0.39) and 24 months (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.52 to 2.03, n = 201, 2 RCTs,  I² = 0%, P = 0.94) were uncertain. There was evidence from one trial of a reduction in the number of days per month in a residential home or hospital unit in the case management group at six months (MD -5.80, 95% CI -7.93 to -3.67, n = 88, 1 RCT, P < 0.0001) and at 12 months (MD -7.70, 95% CI -9.38 to -6.02, n = 88, 1 RCT, P < 0.0001). One trial reported the length of time until participants were institutionalised at 12 months and the effects were uncertain (hazard ratio (HR): 0.66, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.14, P = 0.14). There was no difference in the number of people admitted to hospital at six (4 RCTs, 439 participants), 12 (5 RCTs, 585 participants) and 18 months (5 RCTs, 613 participants). For mortality at 4 - 6, 12, 18 - 24 and 36 months, and for participants' or carers' quality of life at 4, 6, 12 and 18 months, there were no significant effects. There was some evidence of benefits in carer burden at six months (SMD -0.07, 95% CI -0.12 to -0.01, n = 4601, 4 RCTs,  I² = 26%, P = 0.03) but the effects at 12 or 18 months were uncertain. Additionally, some evidence indicated case management was more effective at reducing behaviour disturbance at 18 months (SMD -0.35, 95% CI -0.63 to -0.07, n = 206, 2 RCTs  I² = 0%, P = 0.01) but effects were uncertain at four (2 RCTs), six (4 RCTs) or 12 months (5 RCTs). The case management group showed a small significant improvement in carer depression at 18 months (SMD -0.08, 95% CI -0.16 to -0.01, n = 2888, 3 RCTs, I² = 0%, P = 0.03). Conversely, the case management group showed greater improvement in carer well-being in a single study at six months (MD -2.20 CI -4.14 to -0.26, n = 65, 1 RCT, P = 0.03) but the effects were uncertain at 12 or 18 months. There was some evidence that case management reduced the total cost of services at 12 months (SMD -0.07, 95% CI -0.12 to -0.02, n = 5276, 2 RCTs, P = 0.01) and incurred lower dollar expenditure for the total three years (MD -705.00, 95% CI -1170.31 to -239.69, n = 5170, 1 RCT, P = 0.003). Data on a number of outcomes consistently indicated that the intervention group received significantly more community services. There is some evidence that case management is beneficial at improving some outcomes at certain time points, both in the person with dementia and in their carer. However, there was considerable heterogeneity between the interventions, outcomes measured and time points across the 13 included RCTs. There was some evidence from good-quality studies to suggest that admissions to care homes and overall healthcare costs are reduced in the medium term; however, the results at longer points of follow-up were uncertain. There was not enough evidence to clearly assess whether case management could delay institutionalisation in care homes. There were uncertain results in patient depression, functional abilities and cognition. Further work should be undertaken to investigate what components of case management are associated with improvement in outcomes. Increased consistency in measures of outcome would support future meta-analysis.","Many people are affected by dementia and the numbers are expected to rise as populations age. Most types of dementia are characterised by loss of memory and impairment in other cognitive functions, accompanied by functional impairment and difficulties in performing activities of daily living. The increasing number of people with dementia means more demand for both informal and formal sources of care. The extent of support provided depends on factors such as living situation, patient's and carer's characteristics, service provision, and availability of social networks. There are also wider financial costs of care, for example carers missing work for appointments or crises, becoming part-time workers, or leaving work altogether. Developing interventions such as case management, which enhances the co-ordination between different agencies involved in community care, might offer the support necessary to cover some of the needs of people with dementia and their carers. How case management is organised and implemented varies widely, and access to this type of care is influenced by long-term care funding policies and cultural variations in different countries. Case management has been tested in people with dementia and in carers in a number of countries and healthcare systems, but it is not clear whether current evidence supports its effectiveness. We found 13 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including 9615 participants with dementia worldwide. Eleven RCTs also included carers. Studies were conducted in different countries, varied in size and healthcare systems and compared various types of case management interventions with usual care or augmented usual care. Some studies examined the benefit of case management in reducing admissions to residential or nursing homes (institutionalisation). We found benefits at six months and 18 months but not at 12 and 24 months. However, when only studies which were clearly focused upon delaying institutionalisation or prolonging the period of community care were included we found a reduction in institutionalisation at 12 months. Some studies examined the benefits of case management in terms of reduced hospital length of stay, and there was evidence to suggest that it might increase at six months. Some studies indicated that case management was more effective at reducing behaviour disturbance at 18 months, reducing carer burden and depression and improving carer well-being at six months and social support at 12 months. Case management increases the use of community services but there was some indication that overall healthcare costs may be reduced in the first year. Some studies reported that case management was no more effective than usual care in improving patient depression, functional abilities or cognition. There was not enough evidence to clearly assess whether case management could increase the length of time until people with dementia were admitted to care homes. There were some problems regarding the methods of the studies. Similarly, the different ways in which the case management interventions were provided and the differences in outcome measurements made it difficult to draw clear conclusions.",1124,dementia; case management; institutionalisation; residential or nursing homes; community services; care homes; healthcare costs; behaviour disturbance; cognitive improvement; functional abilities,What are the implications of case management interventions on healthcare costs according to the studies?,How does the variability in case management implementation affect the study's conclusions?,Select all of the following that are colors,In what manner could the study's methodology be adjusted to improve its focus on long-term outcomes?,What differences were observed in the effectiveness of case management at various follow-up points?,"They consistently reduce overall healthcare costs.; They show mixed results, with some indication of cost reduction at 12 months.; They increase healthcare costs due to the integration of multiple services.","They show mixed results, with some indication of cost reduction at 12 months.",It creates challenges in measuring consistent outcomes.; It simplifies the comparison between different healthcare systems.; It enhances the generalizability of the study's results.,It creates challenges in measuring consistent outcomes.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,By incorporating a larger number of RCTs focused on longer follow-up periods.; By restricting the study to short-term outcomes only.; By increasing the sample size without altering the follow-up duration.,By incorporating a larger number of RCTs focused on longer follow-up periods.,Significant differences in institutionalization reduction were observed only at 6 and 18 months.; All time points showed equal effectiveness in reducing institutionalization.; Every follow-up point showed a consistent level of reduced healthcare costs.,Significant differences in institutionalization reduction were observed only at 6 and 18 months.
612fa6644526903f736cf925,finetuned_5,Use of medication to treat depression in people with opioid dependence,"Lifetime prevalence of depression in subjects with opioid dependence is higher than in the general population (44-54% versus 16%) and represents a risk factor for morbidity and mortality. For patients on opioid agonist treatment, current prevalence rates of depression ranges between 10 and 30%, influencing negatively the outcome of the treatment. To evaluate the efficacy and the acceptability of antidepressants for the treatment of depressed opioid dependents treated with opioid agonists. We searched Pubmed, EMBASE, CINAHL (to October 2009), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library Cochrane Drug and Alcohol Group Specialised Register, issue 4, 2009), main electronic sources of ongoing trials, specific trial databases and reference lists of all relevant papers. Randomised and controlled clinical trials examining the efficacy of any antidepressant medication to treat depressed opioid dependents in treatment with opioid agonists. Two authors independently screened and extracted data from studies. Seven studies, 482 participants, met the inclusion criteria.  Comparing antidepressant with placebo, no statistically significant results for dropouts. Selecting studies with low risk of bias, 325 participants, results favour placebo, RR 1.40 (Cl 95% 1.00 to 1.96). For severity of depression, results from two studies, 183 participants, favour antidepressants utilising Clinical Global Impression Scale RR 1.92 (CI 95% 1.26 to 2.94), while another study, 95 participants, utilising the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, did not find a statistically significant difference RR 0.96 (CI 95% 0.54 to 1.71). For adverse events, result favour placebo, four studies, 311 participants, RR 2.90 (Cl 95% 1.23 to 6.86). For drug use, three studies, 211 participants, it was not possible to pool data because outcomes' measures were not comparable. Looking at singular studies, no statistically significant difference was seen. - Comparing different classes of antidepressants, the results favour tricyclics for severity of depression, two studies, 183 participants, RR 1.92 (Cl 95% 1.26 to 2.94) and favour placebo for adverse events, two studies, 172 participants, RR 3.11 (Cl 95% 1.06 to 9.12). There is low evidence, at the present, supporting the clinical use of antidepressants for the treatment of depressed opioid addicts in treatment with opioid agonists. There is a need of larger randomised studies investigating relevant outcomes, safety issues and reporting data to allow comparison of results.","There is little evidence to support the use of antidepressants for treating people who are dependent on opioids and have clinical depression. Depression is more common in people with substance abuse and dependence than in the general population. The depression experienced is also associated with an increased risk of completed suicide. Depression may represent an independent disorder, the psychosocial stress associated with addictive behavior or it could be a consequence of drug use and drug withdrawal effects. A maintenance program with opioid agonists (methadone, buprenorphine, LAAM) is an effective treatment for people who are dependent on opioids in terms of retention in treatment and reduced use of opioids. Depression is however still prevalent and negatively impacts on treatment outcomes. Treatment with antidepressant drugs has therefore been proposed. These adjunct drug treatments include tricyclic antidepressants (doxepin, desipramine, imipramine) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs fluoxetine, sertraline). Authors included seven randomised controlled studies that involved 482 participants in our review. The studies were conducted in outpatient settings over four to 16 weeks; six were in USA and one in Australia. The mean age of participants was 34 years and 62% were males. No clear difference was found in the number of dropouts from an opioid agonist maintenance program between people receiving antidepressants and those in the placebo groups. Neither was drug use different (two studies). Severity of depression was reduced with the use of antidepressants (two studies), including tricyclic antidepressants. Adverse events were important as more of the participants who received antidepressants withdrew from the studies for medical reasons compared with those participants on placebo (four studies). The differences between studies in clinical (participant characteristics, the medications used, services and treatments delivered) and methodological characteristics (study design and quality) made it difficult to draw confident conclusions about the efficacy and safety of antidepressants for the treatment of depression in people who are dependent on opioids.",1118,depression; opioid dependence; opioid agonist treatment; antidepressants; tricyclics; adverse events,How does the presence of depression influence the outcomes of opioid agonist treatments according to the study?,What criteria should future studies meet to improve evidence on the efficacy of antidepressants for opioid-dependent individuals?,Select all of the following that are colors,What is the main conclusion about antidepressant use for opioid dependents?,"In the summary, how did adverse events affect antidepressant use in the studies?",It enhances the retention of participants in treatment programs.; It negatively impacts the treatment outcomes.; It has no significant impact on treatment outcomes.,It negatively impacts the treatment outcomes.,Larger randomized trials with relevant outcome reporting.; Increased focus on drug misuse prevention.; Studies with diverse participant characteristics.,Larger randomized trials with relevant outcome reporting.; Studies with diverse participant characteristics.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Little evidence supports their use; They are highly recommended; They completely cure both addiction and depression,Little evidence supports their use,They led to more study withdrawals; They had no impact on the studies; They improved retention in studies,They led to more study withdrawals
612fa6644526903f736cf925,finetuned_6,Which exercise is better for reducing fatigue caused by cancer: cardiovascular or resistance training?,"With prevalence estimates between 50% and 90% of people with cancer, cancer-related fatigue is one of the most common morbidities related to cancer and its treatment. Exercise is beneficial for the treatment of cancer-related fatigue. However, the efficacy of different types of exercise (i.e. cardiovascular training and resistance training) have not yet been investigated systematically and compared directly in a meta-analysis.
To compare the benefits and harms of cardiovascular training versus resistance training for treatment or prevention of cancer-related fatigue in people with cancer.
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and five other databases in January 2023. We searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials. We integrated results from update searches of previously published Cochrane reviews. In total, our searches included trials from inception to October 2023.
We included randomised controlled trials investigating cardiovascular training compared with resistance training, with exercise as the main component. We included studies on adults with cancer (aged 18 years and older), with or without a diagnosis of cancer-related fatigue, for any type of cancer and any type of cancer treatment, with the intervention starting before, during, or after treatment. We included trials evaluating at least one of our primary outcomes (cancer-related fatigue or quality of life). We excluded combined cardiovascular and resistance interventions, yoga, and mindfulness-based interventions. Our primary outcomes were cancer-related fatigue and quality of life. Our secondary outcomes were adverse events, anxiety, and depression.
We used standard Cochrane methodology. For analyses, we pooled results within the same period of outcome assessment (i.e. short term (up to and including 12 weeks' follow-up), medium term (more than 12 weeks' to less than six months' follow-up), and long term (six months' follow-up or longer)). We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane RoB 1 tool, and certainty of the evidence using GRADE.
We included six studies with 447 participants with prostate, breast, or lung cancer who received radiotherapy or chemotherapy, had surgery, or a combination of these. All studies had a high risk of bias due to lack of blinding. Three studies had an additional high risk of bias domain; one study for attrition bias, and two studies for selection bias. Interventions in the cardiovascular training groups included training on a cycle ergometer, treadmill, an elliptical trainer, or indoor bike. Interventions in the resistance training group included a varying number of exercises using bodyweight, weights, or resistance bands. Interventions varied in frequency, intensity, and duration. None of the included studies reported including participants with a confirmed cancer-related fatigue diagnosis. The interventions in four studies started during cancer treatment and in two studies after cancer treatment. Before treatment No studies reported interventions starting before cancer treatment. During treatment the evidence was very uncertain about the effect of cardiovascular training compared with resistance training for short-term cancer-related fatigue (mean difference (MD)-0.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.52 to 1.84; 4 studies, 311 participants; Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue) scale where higher values indicate better outcome; very low-certainty evidence) and long-term cancer-related fatigue (MD 1.30, 95% CI: 2.17 to 4.77; 1 study, 141 participants; FACIT-Fatigue scale; very low-certainty evidence). The evidence was very uncertain about the effect of cardiovascular training compared with resistance training for short-term quality of life (MD 1.47, 95% CI -1.47 to 4.42; 4 studies, 319 participants; Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy General scale where higher values indicate better outcome; very low-certainty evidence) and for long-term quality of life (MD 3.40, 95% CI -4.85 to 11.65; 1 study, 141 participants; Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Anemia scale where higher values indicate better outcome; very low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of cardiovascular training compared with resistance training on the occurrence of adverse events at any follow-up (risk ratio (RR) 2.00, 95% CI 0.19 to 21.18; 2 studies, 128 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No studies reported medium-term cancer-related fatigue or quality of life. After treatment, the evidence was very uncertain about the effect of cardiovascular training compared with resistance training for short-term cancer-related fatigue (MD 1.47, 95% CI -0.09 to 3.03; 1 study, 95 participants; Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory 20 General Fatigue subscale where higher values indicate worse outcome; very low-certainty evidence). Resistance training may improve short-term quality of life compared to cardiovascular training, but the evidence is very uncertain (MD -10.96, 95% CI -17.77 to -4.15; 1 study, 95 participants; European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30 Global Health subscale where higher values indicate better outcome; very low-certainty evidence). No studies reported outcomes at medium-term or long-term follow-up. Overall, the evidence is very uncertain about the effects of cardiovascular training compared with resistance training on treatment of cancer-related fatigue in people with cancer. Larger, well-conducted studies including people with different cancer types receiving different treatments are needed to increase the certainty in the evidence and to better understand who may benefit most from cardiovascular or resistance training. Moreover, studies comparing the effects of cardiovascular and resistance training initiated before as well as after cancer treatment are needed to understand the prophylactic and rehabilitative effects of these exercise types on cancer-related fatigue.","Fatigue caused by cancer is a feeling of extreme tiredness that lasts for a long time. It is related to cancer or cancer treatment, or both. It affects both the body and feelings, and can make it difficult to do regular activities. Fatigue caused by cancer is a lot worse than regular tiredness, and it does not go away with more sleep or rest.
We wanted to find out if there are differences between cardiovascular training and resistance training for the treatment and prevention of fatigue caused by cancer, well-being (also known as quality of life), and unwanted effects. Cardiovascular training involves exercise such as walking, running, swimming, and cycling, whereas resistance training includes exercise using one's own bodyweight, weights, or elastic therapy bands.
We searched for studies that compared cardiovascular training and resistance training in people with any type of cancer. Training could have been started before, during, or after cancer treatment.
We summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.
We found six studies that involved 447 people with breast cancer, prostate cancer (a small gland in the pelvis that is part of the male reproductive system), or lung cancer. These studies did not report if people already had fatigue caused by cancer before starting to exercise. People in these studies were treated with chemotherapy (medicines to kill the cancer), radiotherapy (radiation directed at the cancer to reduce or kill it), surgery (to remove the cancer), or a combination of these. The cardiovascular or resistance training started during or after cancer treatment. Most studies looked at short-term results (up to and including 12 weeks of monitoring), only one study had long-term results (six months or longer of monitoring). Studies were supported by research grants and took place in Canada, Belgium, the USA, and Germany.
The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of cardiovascular and resistance training on fatigue caused by cancer, well-being, and unwanted effects in the short or long term.
Our confidence in the evidence is very low. We found only a few studies including low numbers of people. We also found problems in the methods of the studies. For example, people in the studies knew which training they received.

612fa6644526903f736cf925,finetuned_6,Does personalised advice via computer or mobile devices reduce heavy drinking?,"Excessive alcohol use contributes significantly to physical and psychological illness, injury and death, and a wide array of social harm in all age groups. A proven strategy for reducing excessive alcohol consumption levels is to offer a brief conversation-based intervention in primary care settings, but more recent technological innovations have enabled people to interact directly via computer, mobile device or smartphone with digital interventions designed to address problem alcohol consumption. To assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of digital interventions for reducing hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption, alcohol-related problems, or both, in people living in the community, specifically: (i) Are digital interventions more effective and cost-effective than no intervention (or minimal input) controls? (ii) Are digital interventions at least equally effective as face-to-face brief alcohol interventions? (iii) What are the effective component behaviour change techniques (BCTs) of such interventions and their mechanisms of action? (iv) What theories or models have been used in the development and/or evaluation of the intervention? Secondary objectives were (i) to assess whether outcomes differ between trials where the digital intervention targets participants attending health, social care, education or other community-based settings and those where it is offered remotely via the internet or mobile phone platforms; (ii) to specify interventions according to their mode of delivery (e.g. functionality features) and assess the impact of mode of delivery on outcomes. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ERIC, HTA and Web of Knowledge databases; ClinicalTrials.com and WHO ICTRP trials registers and relevant websites to April 2017. We also checked the reference lists of included trials and relevant systematic reviews. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effectiveness of digital interventions compared with no intervention or with face-to-face interventions for reducing hazardous or harmful alcohol consumption in people living in the community and reported a measure of alcohol consumption. We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. We included 57 studies which randomised a total of 34,390 participants. The main sources of bias were from attrition and participant blinding (36% and 21% of studies respectively, high risk of bias). Forty one studies (42 comparisons, 19,241 participants) provided data for the primary meta-analysis, which demonstrated that participants using a digital intervention drank approximately 23 g alcohol weekly (95% CI 15 to 30) (about 3 UK units) less than participants who received no or minimal interventions at end of follow up (moderate-quality evidence). Fifteen studies (16 comparisons, 10,862 participants) demonstrated that participants who engaged with digital interventions had less than one drinking day per month fewer than no intervention controls (moderate-quality evidence), 15 studies (3587 participants) showed about one binge drinking session less per month in the intervention group compared to no intervention controls (moderate-quality evidence), and in 15 studies (9791 participants) intervention participants drank one unit per occasion less than no intervention control participants (moderate-quality evidence). Only five small studies (390 participants) compared digital and face-to-face interventions. There was no difference in alcohol consumption at end of follow up (MD 0.52 g/week, 95% CI -24.59 to 25.63; low-quality evidence). Thus, digital alcohol interventions produced broadly similar outcomes in these studies. No studies reported whether any adverse effects resulted from the interventions. A median of nine BCTs were used in experimental arms (range = 1 to 22). 'B' is an estimate of effect (MD in quantity of drinking, expressed in g/week) per unit increase in the BCT, and is a way to report whether individual BCTs are linked to the effect of the intervention. The BCTs of goal setting (B -43.94, 95% CI -78.59 to -9.30), problem solving (B -48.03, 95% CI -77.79 to -18.27), information about antecedents (B -74.20, 95% CI -117.72 to -30.68), behaviour substitution (B -123.71, 95% CI -184.63 to -62.80) and credible source (B -39.89, 95% CI -72.66 to -7.11) were significantly associated with reduced alcohol consumption in unadjusted models. In a multivariable model that included BCTs with B > 23 in the unadjusted model, the BCTs of behaviour substitution (B -95.12, 95% CI -162.90 to -27.34), problem solving (B -45.92, 95% CI -90.97 to -0.87), and credible source (B -32.09, 95% CI -60.64 to -3.55) were associated with reduced alcohol consumption. The most frequently mentioned theories or models in the included studies were Motivational Interviewing Theory (7/20), Transtheoretical Model (6/20) and Social Norms Theory (6/20). Over half of the interventions (n = 21, 51%) made no mention of theory. Only two studies used theory to select participants or tailor the intervention. There was no evidence of an association between reporting theory use and intervention effectiveness. There is moderate-quality evidence that digital interventions may lower alcohol consumption, with an average reduction of up to three (UK) standard drinks per week compared to control participants. Substantial heterogeneity and risk of performance and publication bias may mean the reduction was lower. Low-quality evidence from fewer studies suggested there may be little or no difference in impact on alcohol consumption between digital and face-to-face interventions. The BCTs of behaviour substitution, problem solving and credible source were associated with the effectiveness of digital interventions to reduce alcohol consumption and warrant further investigation in an experimental context. Reporting of theory use was very limited and often unclear when present. Over half of the interventions made no reference to any theories. Limited reporting of theory use was unrelated to heterogeneity in intervention effectiveness.","We aimed to find out if personalised advice to reduce heavy drinking provided using a computer or mobile device is better than nothing or printed information. We also compared advice provided using a computer or mobile device to advice given in a face-to-face conversation. The main outcome was how much alcohol people drank.
Heavy drinking causes over 60 diseases, as well as many accidents, injuries and early deaths each year. Brief advice or counselling, delivered by doctors or nurses, can help people reduce their drinking by around 4 to 5 units a week. In the UK, this is around two pints (1.13 L) of beer or half a bottle of wine (375 mL) each week. However, people may be embarrassed by talking about alcohol. The studies included people in workplaces, colleges or health clinics and internet users. Everyone typed information about their drinking into a computer or mobile device - which then gave half the people advice about how much they drank and the effect this has on health. This group also received suggestions about how to cut down on drinking. The other group could sometimes read general health information. Between one month and one year later, everyone was asked to confirm how much they were drinking. Drinking levels in both groups were compared to each other at these time points. Many (56%) studies were funded by government or research foundation funds. Some (11%) were funded by personal awards such as PhD fellowships. The rest did not report sources of funding. We included 57 studies comparing the drinking of people getting advice about alcohol from computers or mobile devices with those who did not after one to 12 months. Of these, 41 studies (42 comparisons, 19,241 participants) focused on the actual amounts that people reported drinking each week. Most people reported drinking less if they received advice about alcohol from a computer or mobile device compared to people who did not get this advice. Evidence shows that the amount of alcohol people cut down may be about 1.5 pints (800 mL) of beer or a third of a bottle of wine (250 mL) each week. Other measures supported the effectiveness of digital alcohol interventions, although the size of the effect tended to be smaller than for overall alcohol consumption. Positive differences in measures of drinking were seen at 1, 6 and 12 months after the advice. There was not enough information to help us decide if advice was better from computers, telephones or the internet to reduce risky drinking. We do not know which pieces of advice were the most important to help people reduce problem drinking. However, advice from trusted people such as doctors seemed helpful, as did recommendations that people think about specific ways they could overcome problems that might prevent them from drinking less and suggestions about things to do instead of drinking. We included five studies which compared the drinking of people who got advice from computers or mobile devices with advice from face-to-face conversations with doctors or nurses; there may be little or no difference between these to reduce heavy drinking. No studies reported whether any harm came from the interventions. Personalised advice using computers or mobile devices may help people reduce heavy drinking better than doing nothing or providing only general health information. Personalised advice through computers or mobile devices may make little or no difference to reduce drinking compared to face-to-face conversation.",1061,brief conversation-based intervention; hazardous alcohol consumption; community-based settings; behavior change techniques; Behavior substitution,What specific behavior change techniques (BCTs) were most strongly associated with the effectiveness of digital interventions?,Which measure was used as a key outcome for assessing digital interventions?,Select the items that are animals,How is the advice delivered through digital interventions typically personalized?,In what way did the results vary when digital interventions were compared with face-to-face advice?,Goal setting and credible source; Behavior substitution and problem-solving; Information about antecedents and behavior substitution,Behavior substitution and problem-solving,How much alcohol people drank; The participants' weight loss; The number of exercise sessions per week,How much alcohol people drank,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,By considering individual drinking habits and health effects; By providing generalized health tips; By sending automated text messages at fixed times,By considering individual drinking habits and health effects,There was little or no difference in effectiveness; Digital was significantly more effective; Face-to-face was significantly more effective,There was little or no difference in effectiveness
5b8dbff00c740e00019d861a,static_1,Are services organised to deliver care for people with atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat) better than usual (routine) care?,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an increasingly prevalent heart rhythm condition in adults. It is considered a common cardiovascular condition with complex clinical management. The increasing prevalence and complexity in management underpin the need to adapt and innovate in the delivery of care for people living with AF. There is a need to systematically examine the optimal way in which clinical services are organised to deliver evidence-based care for people with AF. Recommended approaches include collaborative, organised multidisciplinary, and virtual (or eHealth/mHealth) models of care.
To assess the effects of clinical service organisation for AF versus usual care for people with all types of AF.
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL to October 2022. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP to April 2023. We applied no restrictions on date, publication status, or language.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), published as full texts and as abstract only, involving adults (? 18 years) with a diagnosis of any type of AF. We included RCTs comparing organised clinical service, disease-specific management interventions (including e-health models of care) for people with AF that were multicomponent and multidisciplinary in nature to usual care.
Three review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data from the included studies. We calculated risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous data and mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using random-effects analyses. We then calculated the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) using the RR. We performed sensitivity analyses by only including studies with a low risk of selection and attrition bias. We assessed heterogeneity using the I² statistic and the certainty of the evidence according to GRADE. The primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and all-cause hospitalisation. The secondary outcomes were cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular hospitalisation, AF-related emergency department visits, thromboembolic complications, minor cerebrovascular bleeding events, major cerebrovascular bleeding events, all bleeding events, AF-related quality of life, AF symptom burden, cost of intervention, and length of hospital stay.
We included 8 studies (8205 participants) of collaborative, multidisciplinary care, or virtual care for people with AF. The average age of participants ranged from 60 to 73 years. The studies were conducted in China, the Netherlands, and Australia. The included studies involved either a nurse-led multidisciplinary approach (n = 4) or management using mHealth (n = 2) compared to usual care. Only six out of the eight included studies could be included in the meta-analysis (for all-cause mortality and all-cause hospitalisation, cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular hospitalisation, thromboembolic complications, and major bleeding), as quality of life was not assessed using a validated outcome measure specific for AF. We assessed the overall risk of bias as high, as all studies had at least one domain at unclear or high risk of bias rating for performance bias (blinding) in particular. Organised AF clinical services probably result in a large reduction in all-cause mortality (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.89; 5 studies, 4664 participants; moderate certainty evidence; 6-year NNTB 37) compared to usual care. However, organised AF clinical services probably make little to no difference to all-cause hospitalisation (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.02; 2 studies, 1340 participants; moderate certainty evidence; 2-year NNTB 101) and may not reduce cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.19; 5 studies, 4564 participants; low certainty evidence; 6-year NNTB 86) compared to usual care. Organised AF clinical services reduce cardiovascular hospitalisation (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.96; 3 studies, 3641 participants; high certainty evidence; 6-year NNTB 28) compared to usual care. Organised AF clinical services may have little to no effect on thromboembolic complications such as stroke (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.77; 5 studies, 4653 participants; low certainty evidence; 6-year NNTB 588) and major cerebrovascular bleeding events (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.97; 3 studies, 2964 participants; low certainty evidence; 6-year NNTB 556). None of the studies reported minor cerebrovascular events.
Moderate certainty evidence shows that organisation of clinical services for AF likely results in a large reduction in all-cause mortality, but probably makes little to no difference to all-cause hospitalisation compared to usual care. Organised AF clinical services may not reduce cardiovascular mortality, but do reduce cardiovascular hospitalisation compared to usual care. However, organised AF clinical services may make little to no difference to thromboembolic complications and major cerebrovascular events. None of the studies reported minor cerebrovascular events. Due to the limited number of studies, more research is required to compare different models of care organisation, including utilisation of mHealth. Appropriately powered trials are needed to confirm these findings and robustly examine the effect on inconclusive outcomes. The findings of this review underscore the importance of the co-ordination of care underpinned by collaborative multidisciplinary approaches and augmented by virtual care.","Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an irregular heartbeat that happens when the electrical signals in the heart fire quickly at the same time. This causes the heart to beat too fast or too slow, which can cause troubling symptoms and serious medical complications, including blood clots that can lead to stroke (where blood flow to the brain is blocked). Atrial fibrillation is treated with lifestyle changes, medication, and procedures, including surgery, to help prevent blood clots, control the heartbeat, or restore the heart's normal rhythm. Organised care services for AF involve: (i) providing care that is focused on improving people's care experiences, health outcomes, and quality of life; (ii) that is delivered by a team of healthcare providers from various fields of study working together; and (iii) that uses technology to support the integrated approach. Routine care is care provided as part of normal practice.
We wanted to find out if organised care services for AF were better than usual (routine) care in reducing death and hospital admission from all causes. We also wanted to find out if organised care services for AF were better than routine care in reducing heart-related death and hospital admissions, AF-related emergency department visits, complications such as stroke and mini-stroke, major and minor complications related to bleeding in the brain, AF-related quality of life, AF symptoms, length of hospital stay, and cost related to the services. We searched for studies comparing organised care services for AF to routine care in adults diagnosed with AF. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.
We found 8 studies involving a total of 8205 people with AF, with an average age of 60 to 73 years. The included studies were performed in China, the Netherlands, and Australia. All eight studies reported receiving individual grants or a combination of public funding and funding from industry. Compared to routine care, organised AF care services:
- prevent one death from all causes for every 37 patients treated and followed for six years;
- prevent one hospital admission from all causes for every 101 patients treated and followed for two years;
- prevent one heart-related death for every 86 patients treated and followed for six years; and
- prevent one heart-related hospital admission for every 28 patients treated and followed for six years; but
- may make little to no difference to complications such as stroke and mini-stroke (one complication prevented for every 588 patients treated and followed for six years) and major complications related to bleeding in the brain (one bleeding complication prevented for every 556 patients treated and followed for six years).
No study assessed minor complications related to bleeding in the brain.
Our confidence in the evidence for death and hospital admissions from all causes is only moderate because it is possible that some study participants were aware of which treatment they were getting, which could have influenced the results.
We have little confidence in the evidence for heart-related death because the ways treatment was delivered varied across studies, and it is possible that some study participants were aware of which treatment they were getting, which could have influenced the results. We are confident that organised care services for AF reduce heart-related hospital admissions.
We have little confidence in the evidence for complications and bleeding-related complications specifically because the ways treatment was delivered varied across studies, and it is possible that some study participants were aware of which treatment they were getting, which could have influenced the results.

5b8dbff00c740e00019d861a,static_2,Drug or psychological interventions for preventing depression in people with long-term physical conditions,"Major depression is one of the world's leading causes of disability in adults with long-term physical conditions compared to those without physical illness. This co-morbidity is associated with a negative prognosis in terms of increased morbidity and mortality rates, increased healthcare costs, decreased adherence to treatment regimens, and a substantial decline in quality of life. Therefore, preventing the onset of depressive episodes in adults with long-term physical conditions should be a global healthcare aim. In this review, primary or tertiary (in cases of preventing recurrences in those with a history of depression) prevention are the focus. While primary prevention aims at preventing the onset of depression, tertiary prevention comprises both preventing recurrences and prohibiting relapses. Tertiary prevention aims to address a depressive episode that might still be present, is about to subside, or has recently resolved. We included tertiary prevention in the case where the focus was preventing the onset of depression in those with a history of depression (preventing recurrences) but excluded it if it specifically focused on maintaining an condition or implementing rehabilitation services (relapse prevention). Secondary prevention of depression seeks to prevent the progression of depressive symptoms by early detection and treatment and may therefore be considered a 'treatment,' rather than prevention. We therefore exclude the whole spectrum of secondary prevention. To assess the effectiveness, acceptability and tolerability of psychological or pharmacological interventions, in comparison to control conditions, in preventing depression in adults with long-term physical conditions; either before first ever onset of depressive symptoms (i.e. primary prevention) or before first onset of depressive symptoms in patients with a history of depression (i.e. tertiary prevention). We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and two trials registries, up to 6 February 2020. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of preventive psychological or pharmacological interventions, specifically targeting incidence of depression in comparison to treatment as usual (TAU), waiting list, attention/psychological placebo, or placebo. Participants had to be age 18 years or older, with at least one long-term physical condition, and no diagnosis of major depression at baseline (primary prevention). In addition, we included studies comprising mixed samples of patients with and without a history of depression, which explored tertiary prevention of recurrent depression. We excluded other tertiary prevention studies. We also excluded secondary preventive interventions. Primary outcomes included incidence of depression, tolerability, and acceptability. Secondary outcomes included severity of depression, cost-effectiveness and cost-utility. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We included 11 RCTs, with one trial on psychological interventions, and 10 trials on pharmacological interventions. Data analyses on the psychological intervention (problem-solving therapy compared to TAU) included 194 participants with age-related macular degeneration. Data analyses on pharmacological interventions included 837 participants comparing citalopram (one trial), escitalopram (three trials), a mixed sample of fluoxetine/nortriptyline (one trial), melatonin (one trial), milnacipran (one trial), and sertraline (three trials), each to placebo. Included types of long-term physical conditions were acute coronary syndrome (one trial), breast cancer (one trial), head and neck cancer (two trials), stroke (five trials), and traumatic brain injury (one trial). Very low-certainty evidence of one study suggests that problem solving therapy may be slightly more effective than TAU in preventing the incidence of depression, immediately post-intervention (odds ratio (OR) 0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.20 to 0.95; 194 participants). However, there may be little to no difference between groups at six months follow-up (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.38; 190 participants; one study; very low-certainty evidence). No data were available regarding incidence of depression after six months. Regarding acceptability (drop-outs due to any cause), slightly fewer drop-outs occurred in the TAU group immediately post-intervention (OR 5.21, 95% CI 1.11 to 24.40; 206 participants; low-certainty evidence). After six months, however, the groups did not differ (OR 1.67, 95% CI 0.58 to 4.77; 206 participants; low-certainty evidence). This study did not measure tolerability. Post-intervention, compared to placebo, antidepressants may be beneficial in preventing depression in adults with different types of long-term physical conditions, but the evidence is very uncertain (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.49; 814 participants; nine studies; I2 = 0%; very low-certainty evidence). There may be little to no difference between groups both immediately and at six months follow-up (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.08 to 2.46; 23 participants; one study; very low-certainty evidence) as well as at six to 12 months follow-up (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.23 to 2.82; 233 participants; three studies; I2 = 49%; very low-certainty evidence). There was very low-certainty evidence from five studies regarding the tolerability of the pharmacological intervention. A total of 669 adverse events were observed in 316 participants from the pharmacological intervention group, and 610 adverse events from 311 participants in the placebo group. There was very low-certainty evidence that drop-outs due to adverse events may be less frequent in the placebo group (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.07 to 3.89; 561 participants; five studies; I2 = 0%). There was also very low-certainty evidence that drop-outs due to any cause may not differ between groups either post-intervention (OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.73; 962 participants; nine studies; I2 = 28%), or at six to 12 months (OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.86; 327 participants; three studies; I2 = 0%). Based on evidence of very low certainty, our results may indicate the benefit of pharmacological interventions, during or directly after preventive treatment. Few trials examined short-term outcomes up to six months, nor the follow-up effects at six to 12 months, with studies suffering from great numbers of drop-outs and inconclusive results. Generalisation of results is limited as study populations and treatment regimes were very heterogeneous. Based on the results of this review, we conclude that for adults with long-term physical conditions, there is only very uncertain evidence regarding the implementation of any primary preventive interventions (psychological/pharmacological) for depression.","People with long-term illness or other physical health conditions have a higher risk than other people of developing depression. This can reduce their quality of life. Depression is characterised by symptoms such as low mood, feelings of hopelessness, loss of interest in things that once gave pleasure, and other symptoms, as well as sleep disturbances. People with long-term physical conditions who develop depression are more likely to worsen in their illnesses and are more likely to die. Therefore, preventing depression in people with long-term physical conditions should be an important goal in healthcare. We wanted to know whether standard interventions for treating depression (i.e. psychological treatments and antidepressant drugs) can also safely be used to prevent the onset of an depressive episode in those adults at high risk for depression due to their long-term physical condition, but who do not yet show depressive symptoms. We also wanted to know whether these interventions worked in preventing recurrent depression, in those patients with long-term physical conditions who had a history of depression. First, we searched the medical literature for randomised controlled studies (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups). This type of study provides the most robust evidence about the effects of a treatment. We then compared the results, and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we assessed how certain the evidence was. To do this, we considered factors such as the way studies were conducted, study sizes, and consistency of findings across studies. Based on our assessments, we categorised the evidence as being of very low, low, moderate or high certainty. Medical and mental health care providers (including physicians and psychologists) and pharmacists, as well as adults with long-term physical conditions, their relatives and care-givers. This review includes 11 trials comparing a psychological intervention (problem-solving therapy) to treatment as usual; or comparing pharmacological antidepressant interventions (citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline, fluoxetine/nortriptyline, milnacipran, or melatonin) to placebo. For the psychological intervention, we found only one trial, including 194 people with age-related macular degeneration (an eye disease). For pharmacological interventions, we included 10 trials comprising 1009 people. Due to some participants not completing the studies, we could only analyse data for 837 participants. Our analyses show that people with long-term physical conditions may be less likely to develop depression during treatment with problem solving therapy, or with different types of antidepressants. However, these interventions appear to be beneficial only during treatment. Three to 12 months after treatment, there was no significant difference in onset of depression between the groups that had the interventions and those that did not. Therefore, preventive interventions might be effective in preventing depression onset only for the duration of the intervention. Our conclusions are based on evidence of very low certainty. In addition, there is not enough adequate information on the tolerability (unpleasant but generally medically less important adverse events due to the intervention, e.g. dry mouth) and acceptability (willingness to go through with the intervention even in the presence of adverse events) of these treatments. The interventions may be unsafe, irrespective of their potential to prevent depression.",1119,major depression; disability; co-morbidity; primary prevention; tertiary prevention; depressive episodes; psychological interventions; pharmacological interventions; antidepressants; very low-certainty evidence,"Based on the summary, how valid is it to generalize the study findings to all adults with long-term physical conditions?",What are the main reasons for attempting to prevent depression in people with long-term physical conditions?,Select the items that are animals,How might the onset of depression affect people with long-term physical conditions?,Which interventions were assessed for preventing depression in the study?,"Highly valid, as the study included a large diverse cohort.; Limited validity due to varied physical conditions represented.; Invalid, as the study focused solely on specific conditions like cancer and stroke.",Limited validity due to varied physical conditions represented.,To reduce the risk of developing depression; To increase healthcare costs; To prevent worsening of physical illnesses,To reduce the risk of developing depression; To prevent worsening of physical illnesses,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,It may improve their quality of life; It may increase the risk of mortality; It may decrease adherence to their treatment,It may increase the risk of mortality; It may decrease adherence to their treatment,Psychological interventions; Dietary supplements; Pharmacological interventions,Psychological interventions; Pharmacological interventions
5b8dbff00c740e00019d861a,static_2,What are the benefits and harms of remote ischaemic conditioning (briefly restricting then restoring blood flow) for preventing and treating stroke?,"Remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) has been developed as a neuroprotective strategy to prevent and treat ischaemic stroke. It usually involves restricting blood flow to limbs and then releasing the ischaemic blood to promote a neuroprotective effect. Preclinical studies have suggested that RIC may have beneficial effects in ischaemic stroke patients and those at risk of ischaemic stroke. However, existing evidence is insufficient to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of RIC in preventing and treating ischaemic stroke. To evaluate the benefits and harms of remote ischaemic conditioning in preventing and treating ischaemic stroke compared to sham or standard treatments. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, three Chinese databases, five trials registers, and conference proceedings, together with reference checking and citation searching. The latest search date was 11 March 2025. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing RIC with sham RIC or medical management in people with ischaemic stroke or at risk of ischaemic stroke. Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed trial quality and risk of bias, and extracted data. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence. We included seven trials, involving 735 participants, in this review. We analysed the effects of RIC on preventing and treating ischaemic stroke respectively. We evaluated risk of bias and judged it to be low for generation of allocation sequence in six studies and unclear in one study; unclear for allocation concealment in four studies and low in three studies; high for incomplete outcome data (attrition bias) in five studies and low in two studies; high for blinding in three studies and low in four studies; low for selective reporting; and high for other sources of bias in six studies and low in one study. We included three trials (involving 371 participants) in the analysis of the effects of RIC on ischaemic stroke prevention. In people with symptomatic intracerebral artery stenosis, recurrent stroke was significantly reduced by RIC (risk ratio (RR) 0.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12 to 0.83; 2 trials, 182 participants, low-quality evidence). In people with carotid stenosis undergoing carotid stenting, there was no significant difference in the incidence of ischaemic stroke between participants treated with RIC and non-RIC (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.03; 1 trial, 189 participants, low-quality evidence); however the stroke severity (assessed by infarct volume) was significantly lower in participants treated with RIC (mean difference (MD) -0.17 mL, 95% CI -0.23 to -0.11; 1 trial, 189 participants, low-quality evidence). Adverse events associated with RIC were significantly higher in participants treated with RIC (RR 10.91; 95% CI 2.01 to 59.28; 3 trials, 371 participants, low-quality evidence), but no severe adverse event was attributable to RIC treatment. No participants experienced death or cardiovascular events during the period of the studies; and no trial reported haemorrhagic stroke or improvement in neurological, phycological or cognitive impairment. We included four trials (involving 364 participants) in the analysis of the effects of RIC on ischaemic stroke treatment. In acute ischaemic stroke, for people receiving intravenous thrombolysis, the rate of death or dependency was significantly increased by RIC treatment compared with non-RIC treatment (RR 2.34; 95% 1.19 to 4.61; 1 trial, 285 participants, low-quality evidence). In people with acute ischaemic stroke, there was no significant difference between RIC and non-RIC for reducing stroke severity as assessed by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score and the final infarct volume (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.24 mL, 95% CI -1.02 to 0.54; 2 trials, 175 participants, very low quality evidence). There was no significant difference between RIC and non-RIC for improving the psychological impairment (SMD -0.37 points, 95% CI -1.15 to 0.41; 1 trial, 26 participants, very low quality evidence) and the cognitive impairment (SMD -0.26 points; 95% CI -0.72 to 0.21; 3 trials, 79 participants, low-quality evidence) in people with acute ischaemic stroke and cerebral small vessel disease. No trial reported ischaemic stroke, recurrent ischaemic stroke, improvement in neurological impairment, hemorrhagic stroke, cardiovascular events, and RIC associated adverse events. There is moderate-certainty evidence that RIC compared to non-RIC probably reduces recurrence of ischaemic stroke slightly, and low-certainty evidence that RIC may result in a slight increase in excellent functional outcome (mRS 0 to 1). Evidence for improvement in NIHSS scores is very uncertain due to risk of bias and imprecision. RIC demonstrated an acceptable harm profile with no increase in intracerebral haemorrhage or mortality; however, treatment-related adverse events were more common. The certainty of evidence was limited by high risk of bias for blinding in most studies, incomplete outcome data in some studies, and imprecision in several outcomes. However, the generalisability of these findings may be limited because 79.3% of participants were from China, highlighting the need for further studies in diverse populations to confirm the results. The optimal timing, duration, and method of RIC administration require further investigation through large, high-quality randomised trials with standardised protocols to establish definitive evidence for clinical practice. This updated analysis includes 16 new RCTs, and these findings highlight the need for ongoing research and careful consideration of study design and methodology in future investigations.","Ischaemic stroke is the most common type of stroke. It occurs when a blood clot blocks an artery that supplies blood to the brain. This blockage cuts off the supply of oxygen and nutrients to a part of the brain. Without this blood supply, brain cells in that area are damaged and begin to die. Remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) involves briefly and repeatedly restricting and then restoring blood flow in a limb (an arm or leg) with a blood pressure cuff. The goal is to ""condition"" the limb and trigger the body's natural defences to protect other organs. Studies have found that for people who have had a stroke and are receiving standard medical care, adding RIC can reduce the amount of brain tissue damaged by the stroke, improve recovery of everyday functions, help prevent another stroke from happening, and reduce problems with memory and thinking.
We wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of RIC in people who have had an ischaemic stroke and are undergoing various treatments, including standard medical therapy, intravenous thrombolysis (a clot-dissolving treatment), or mechanical thrombectomy (a procedure to remove clots). Specifically, we wanted to know if RIC was better than sham or standard treatment for improving:
- the risk of dying;
- the risk of having another stroke;
- the likelihood of an excellent recovery (a score on the Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) of 0 to 1);
- the likelihood of being able to live independently (mRS score of 0 to 2);
- the risk of a brain bleed;
- brain function issues;
- the risk of major heart problems.
We also wanted to know if RIC has unwanted effects.
We searched for studies that compared the benefits and harms of remote ischaemic conditioning in people with ischaemic stroke. We then compared and summarised the study results and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and sample sizes.
We found 21 studies with 7687 people. The studies took place in China, Denmark, France, the UK, and Romania, and were published between 2012 and 2025.
Sixteen studies including 6828 participants suggested that RIC compared to sham or no treatment probably leads to a slight reduction in the risk of having another stroke. About half the studies measured participants' level of independence using the mRS and measured change in brain function issues using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). RIC might lead to a slight increase in the number of people achieving an excellent recovery, but may have little or no effect on the number of people being able to live independently. In addition, RIC might result in a slight improvement in brain function issues, but the evidence is very uncertain. There may be little or no difference between RIC and sham or standard treatment in the risk of a brain bleed and major heart problems, and RIC probably does not increase the risk of death. However, RIC may have unwanted effects such as arm pain, redness, or swelling.
We also identified 21 ongoing studies that we plan to add to the next version of our review.
Our confidence in the evidence is moderate to very low for several reasons. Most studies had few participants, and more than half of studies were done in China, which means the results of our review may not apply to people in other parts of the world. Some studies included people who received clot-dissolving treatment (thrombolysis) and people who did not, and we could not separate the results for these two groups. This mix of patients may have affected our overall analysis. Finally, we did not separate the results in our analysis based on the type of comparison group used (sham or standard treatment). This means it is difficult to know if the treatment effect we found was influenced by the type of comparison.",1069,Ischaemic stroke; Remote ischaemic conditioning; Neuroprotective effect; Symptomatic intracerebral artery stenosis; Carotid stenosis; Intravenous thrombolysis; Infarct volume; National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale; Carotid stenting,What is the primary goal of remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) mentioned in the summary?,What effects of RIC on brain function issues were summarized?,Select the items that are animals,How does RIC compare to sham or standard treatment in terms of stroke recurrence risk?,What was evaluated alongside the benefits of RIC in the summary?,To dissolve existing blood clots in the brain.; To trigger the body's natural defenses to protect other organs.; To permanently restrict blood flow to limbs.,To trigger the body's natural defenses to protect other organs.,RIC might result in a slight improvement in brain function issues.; RIC causes significant decline in cognitive function.; RIC has no impact on brain function issues.,RIC might result in a slight improvement in brain function issues.,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,RIC probably leads to a slight reduction in the risk of having another stroke.; RIC significantly increases the risk of recurrent stroke.; RIC has no effect on stroke recurrence risk.,RIC probably leads to a slight reduction in the risk of having another stroke.,The harms of RIC were also evaluated.; Only the economic cost of RIC was evaluated.; RIC's compatibility with other conditions was evaluated.,The harms of RIC were also evaluated.
5b8dbff00c740e00019d861a,interactive_3,Bezafibrate for primary biliary cirrhosis,"Treatment of primary biliary cirrhosis is complicated, and although some studies suggest that bezafibrate, alone or with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), may be effective, no systematic review had summarised the evidence. This review assessed the beneficial and harmful effects of bezafibrate in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. Searches of multiple databases including the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP were conducted up to late 2011, along with Chinese databases up to January 2011, and manufacturers and authors were contacted. All randomised clinical trials comparing bezafibrate at any dose or regimen with placebo, no intervention, or another drug were included, allowing concomitant interventions if equally applied to all groups. Two authors extracted data, and analyses used risk ratios or risk differences for dichotomous data, mean differences for continuous data, and trial sequential analysis to assess random errors. Six trials with 151 Japanese patients were included, all at high risk of bias; four trials compared bezafibrate plus UDCA with no intervention plus UDCA, and two compared bezafibrate with UDCA. No patients died or developed liver-related complications. Bezafibrate had no significant effect on adverse events compared with no intervention (5/32 vs 0/28; RR 5.40, 95% CI 0.69 to 42.32) or UDCA (2/32 vs 0/37; RR 6.19, 95% CI 0.31 to 122.05). Bezafibrate significantly reduced serum alkaline phosphatase activity compared with no intervention (MD -186.04 U/L, 95% CI -249.03 to -123.04) and compared with UDCA (MD -162.90 U/L, 95% CI -199.68 to -126.12), with results supported by trial sequential analyses. Compared with no intervention, bezafibrate also significantly reduced plasma immunoglobulin M (MD -164.00 mg/dl, 95% CI -259.47 to -68.53) and serum bilirubin (MD -0.19 mg/dl, 95% CI -0.38 to -0.00), though these two findings were not supported by trial sequential analyses. Bezafibrate showed no significant effect on serum gamma-glutamyltransferase or alanine aminotransferase compared with no intervention. Compared with UDCA, bezafibrate showed no significant effects on these enzymes or immunoglobulin M in random-effects models, but fixed-effect models suggested significant decreases in all three markers. One patient discontinued bezafibrate due to an adverse event. Overall, bezafibrate showed no effect on mortality, liver-related morbidity, adverse events, or pruritus compared with no intervention or UDCA, and none of the trials assessed quality of life or fatigue. Although bezafibrate may improve some liver biochemical measures, these findings may reflect bias or random error. More rigorous randomised clinical trials are needed.","Primary biliary cirrhosis is a chronic disease of the liver that is characterised by progressive inflammation and destruction of the liver tissue, eventually progressing to liver cirrhosis and the need for liver transplantation. Primary biliary cirrhosis primarily affects middle-aged women. Bezafibrate is a hypolipidaemic agent used in treatment of hypertriglyceridaemia. There are studies suggesting that bezafibrate, alone or in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid, is effective in treatment of primary biliary cirrhosis. Mechanisms through which bezafibrate improves lipid serum concentration balance and prevents biliary cell damage still need to be fully understood. This review evaluates all data on the benefits and harms of bezafibrate for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis in randomised clinical trials. The findings of this review are based on six randomised clinical trials with 151 Japanese patients. Bezafibrate was compared with no intervention in four trials (with co-intervention of ursodeoxycholic acid in both the bezafibrate and control groups) and with ursodeoxycholic acid in two trials. The primary findings of the review are that bezafibrate has no statistically significant effects on mortality, liver-related morbidity, adverse events, and quality of life of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. A possible positive intervention effect of bezafibrate versus no intervention on liver biochemistry measures can be real but could also be due to systematic errors or random errors. The benefits and harms of bezafibrate for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis need further assessment in randomised clinical trials comparing bezafibrate with placebo. Such trials ought to be conducted with impeccable methodology to reduce the risks of random errors and sufficiently large patient groups to reduce the risks of random errors.",1096,bezafibrate; primary biliary cirrhosis; ursodeoxycholic acid; liver-related complications; plasma immunoglobulin M; serum bilirubin; serum gamma-glutamyltransferase; alanine aminotransferase; liver biochemical measures; pruritus,What are the primary motivations for conducting a systematic review on bezafibrate in primary biliary cirrhosis?,How could the findings of this review affect future research directions in liver treatment?,Select all of the following that are colors,How should the potential for systematic or random errors influence the interpretation of bezafibrateÃ¢ÂÂs effects?,What did the trials compare bezafibrate with?,To consolidate existing evidence from scattered studies; To develop new treatment protocols; To address the lack of definitive conclusions regarding its efficacy,To consolidate existing evidence from scattered studies; To address the lack of definitive conclusions regarding its efficacy,By discouraging further trials on bezafibrate; By highlighting the need for rigorously conducted trials; By confirming the current clinical guidelines,By highlighting the need for rigorously conducted trials,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,It should be considered as a major limitation in assessing benefits; It validates the significance of the findings; It suggests that bezafibrate's benefits are entirely due to error,It should be considered as a major limitation in assessing benefits,No intervention and ursodeoxycholic acid; Placebo and vitamins; Dietary changes only,No intervention and ursodeoxycholic acid
5b8dbff00c740e00019d861a,interactive_4,Immunosuppressive treatment for adults with idiopathic membranous nephropathy,"Primary membranous nephropathy (PMN) is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults, and without treatment about one-third of patients experience spontaneous remission, one-third have persistent proteinuria, and one-third progress to end?stage kidney disease (ESKD) within 10 years. Immunosuppressive therapy is used to protect kidney function in patients who do not improve with supportive treatment or who present with severe nephrotic syndrome, but the relative safety and effectiveness of different treatments have been unclear. This updated review included 65 studies involving 3807 adults with PMN and found that, compared with placebo or no immunosuppression, immunosuppressive therapy probably reduces the risk of progressing to ESKD, increases the likelihood of complete or partial remission, and lowers the number of people whose serum creatinine doubles, though it probably makes little or no difference to mortality. However, immunosuppressive therapy may increase relapse after remission and may increase temporary or permanent treatment discontinuation due to adverse effects, while its effects on infection and malignancy remain uncertain. Oral alkylating agents with or without steroids may reduce the risk of ESKD and may increase remission rates but also may lead to more treatment?related adverse events, and their effects on relapse, creatinine progression, infection, and malignancy remain uncertain. Evidence for calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus or cyclosporine), with or without steroids, was very uncertain, including whether they affect remission, relapse, ESKD, or adverse events. When calcineurin inhibitors were compared to alkylating agents, they appeared similarly effective for achieving remission but may result in higher relapse rates, though the overall certainty of evidence was low to moderate. Other treatments such as azathioprine, mizoribine, adrenocorticotropic hormone, traditional Chinese medicines, and rituximab had insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions. Overall, immunosuppressive therapy appears more effective than non-immunosuppressive management for inducing remission and reducing progression to ESKD, but this must be weighed against higher risks of adverse effects, and the evidence base remains limited by small sample sizes, high risk of bias, and inadequate follow-up. Alkylating agents combined with corticosteroids show both short- and long-term benefits but also higher toxicity, calcineurin inhibitors show similar efficacy but uncertain long-term safety, and biologics such as rituximab require further large, high-quality trials to determine their role.","Primary membranous nephropathy (PMN) is an autoimmune disease, where the body's immune system attacks the kidneys. The term ""primary"" is used to describe membranous nephropathy that is not caused by another disease in the body. PMN is a leading cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults. Nephrotic syndrome is a condition, where the membrane of the kidney is damaged and becomes permeable for proteins. Primary membranous nephropathy is diagnosed through findings in a kidney biopsy and the presence of nephrotic syndrome. PMN is not harmful in about one-third of patients, who will have a spontaneous ""complete remission"", which means that the disease will resolve by itself. However, about another one third will experience spontaneous remission but will have some protein in the urine that continues with normal kidney function. These patients usually only require supportive treatments that do not interact with the immune system. Without treatment, about 15% to 50% of patients progress to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) within 10 years. In some patients, PMN can be severe or continues to get worse even after using 6 months of supportive treatments. In these patients, extra treatment that dampens the activity of the immune system may be used to reduce damage to the kidney. It is not clear which of these treatment(s) is the most helpful and what side effects can occur. Therefore, the duration and intensity of immunosuppressive treatment need to be balanced against possible side effects. There are different classes of drugs used in immunosuppressive therapy. These drugs may or may not be combined with corticosteroids (drugs based on the body's stress response hormone cortisol). We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant specialised register up to 1 April 2021. We have combined studies to compare different treatment regimens with immunosuppressive therapy to assess which treatments help to treat patients with PMN and nephrotic syndrome with the least side effects. This review identified sixty-five studies with 3807 patients. Different types of immunosuppressive treatment include alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil), calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus and cyclosporine), antimetabolites (mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine), biologicals (e.g. rituximab) and adrenocorticotropic hormone. These drugs may or may not be combined with corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone), which also suppresses the immune system. After combining the results of available studies together, we found that compared with no treatment, supportive treatment or steroids alone, the use of immunosuppressive treatment probably reduced the number of patients who progressed to ESKD by about 40% and increased the number of patients that achieved complete remission. However, immunosuppressive treatment may lead to more adverse events, which can cause treatment to be stopped or lead to the patients needing to go to hospital. The different drugs that can be used in the immunosuppressive treatment were also examined in our review. We found that alkylating agents probably increases complete remission but may lead to more adverse events. We are uncertain whether alkylating agents increase infection or cancer. Based on the currently available evidence, the effectiveness of using calcineurin inhibitors is still unclear, but there is low certainty of the evidence, that CNI may lead to similar remission rates compared to alkylating agents.
Furthermore, other treatment options such as mycophenolate mofetil, adrenocorticotropic hormone, rituximab and others have only been examined in a few studies. There is not enough data to draw final conclusions on the use of these treatments in adults with PMN and nephrotic syndrome. The treatment of patients with PMN and nephrotic syndrome with immunosuppressive therapy compared to no treatment or supportive therapy alone probably protects the kidney but may increase side effects. A combination of immunosuppressive therapy with steroids may decrease disease activity and the use of alkylating agent combined with steroids probably has the short-term and long-term benefits of limiting damage to the kidney. Other therapies such as calcineurin inhibitors, mycophenolate mofetil, rituximab and adrenocorticotropic hormone have less certainty regarding their safety and effectiveness from these studies.",1086,Primary membranous nephropathy; nephrotic syndrome; immunosuppressive therapy; end-stage kidney disease; proteinuria; spontaneous remission; serum creatinine; alkylating agents; calcineurin inhibitors; rituximab,What is primary membranous nephropathy (PMN) primarily characterized by?,"In the context of PMN, what does spontaneous remission imply?",Select all of the following that are fruits,Which type of PMN patients might require immunosuppressive therapy?,What is a primary goal of immunosuppressive therapy in PMN treatment?,An autoimmune attack on the kidneys; A viral infection affecting the kidneys; A genetic disorder affecting the kidneys,An autoimmune attack on the kidneys,The disease resolves by itself; Immediate need for immunosuppressive therapy; Progression to end-stage kidney disease,The disease resolves by itself,dog; blue; grape,grape,Patients with spontaneous complete remission; Patients with severe or worsening PMN; All patients with nephrotic syndrome,Patients with severe or worsening PMN,To reduce the progression to end-stage kidney disease; To increase proteinuria; To eliminate the need for biopsy,To reduce the progression to end-stage kidney disease
5b8dbff00c740e00019d861a,interactive_4,Lipid-lowering agents for nephrotic syndrome,"Nephrotic syndrome is the collective name given to a group of symptoms that include proteinuria, lipiduria, hypoalbuminaemia, oedema, hypercholesterolaemia, elevated triglycerides, and hyperlipidaemia. Hyperlipidaemia is thought to aggravate glomerulosclerosis (hardening of blood vessels in the kidneys) and enhance progression of glomerular disease. Studies have established that reduction in total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is associated with reduction in risk of cardiovascular diseases. In 2011, the European Society of Cardiology and European Atherosclerosis Society guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemia recommended use of statins as first-line agents in the management of nephrotic dyslipidaemia. However, the effectiveness and safety of statins for people with nephrotic syndrome remains uncertain. Furthermore, the efficacy of second-line lipid-lowering drugs, such as ezetimibe and nicotinic acid, has not been proven in patients with nephrotic syndrome who are unable to tolerate statin therapy. This review aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of lipid-lowering agents in adults and children with nephrotic syndrome. We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register (to 18 March 2013) through contact with the Trials Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review. All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs (RCTs in which allocation to treatment was obtained by alternation, use of alternate medical records, date of birth or other predictable methods) looking at participants with nephrotic syndrome that compared any lipid-lowering agent to placebo, no treatment or other lipid-lowering agents, given for not less than four weeks, were included. Two authors independently assessed study eligibility and risk of bias, and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using a random effects model. Dichotomous results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). For continuous measures mean difference (MD) was used, or the standardised mean difference (SMD) where different scales had been used. We included five RCTs enrolling a total of 203 participants. Of these, four studies compared statins with no treatment or placebo, and one compared fibrates with placebo. We found no published studies comparing second-line agents such as ezetimibe, bile acid sequestrants, and nicotinic acid with placebo or no treatment. Our assessment of the risk of bias found that one study was judged overall to be at low risk of bias and the remaining four were judged to be at high risk of bias. Most outcomes were supported by single study data. One study reported significantly increased high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol among participants in the statin arm compared with the no treatment group (MD 5.40 mg/dL, 95% CI 2.31 to 8.49). Another study reported higher serum albumin in the statin group compared to those who received no treatment (MD 0.60 g/dL, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.06). No serious adverse events, such as rhabdomyolysis, were reported, however some minor events occurred. One study reported no significant difference in the number of participants with elevated liver enzymes (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.13 to 69.52); three studies reported liver enzymes remained within the normal range (no data provided). Four studies reported creatinine phosphokinase (CPK). One study indicated that CPK values fluctuated in both the simvastatin and placebo groups (no data provided); the remaining three studies reported CPK either stayed within the normal range (one study) or there was no significant difference between the lipid lowering agents and placebo. None of the included studies reported patient-centred outcomes including all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, or non-fatal myocardial infarction; only single studies reported cholesterol (HDL, LDL and total cholesterol), triglycerides, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, liver enzymes, and protein (serum, urine). High quality RCTs need to be conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of lipid-lowering drugs for people with nephrotic syndrome.","Nephrotic syndrome is a relatively rare condition in which the kidneys leak protein into the urine, leading to early signs such as swelling of the feet and face, along with low levels of protein in the blood and high levels of fats, particularly cholesterol and triglycerides. Management often includes therapies to reduce blood lipids, and several types of lipid-lowering drugs such as statins, bile acid sequestrants, nicotinic acid, and ezetimibe can be used. We searched for evidence from randomized controlled trials to determine whether lipid-lowering medications are beneficial for people with nephrotic syndrome. We found five small studies involving 203 participants that examined four different lipid-lowering agents: simvastatin, lovastatin, fluvastatin, and gemfibrozil.

We searched the following electronic databases; Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 1), MEDLINE (Ovid SP), EMBASE (Ovid SP), PsycINFO (Ovid SP), Controlled Trials metaRegister (www.controlled-trials.com), AMED (Allied & Complementary Medicine), ISI Web of Science: Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI), PubMed. We also screened the reference lists of all selected papers and contacted authors of relevant studies. The latest search for trials was in February 2008.
Randomised controlled trials that consider one or more defined psychosocial interventions for the prevention of physical disability, mental health problems or reduced social functioning as a result of traumatic physical injury. We excluded studies that included patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Two authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of search results, reviewed the full text of potentially relevant studies, independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. We included five studies, involving 756 participants. Three studies assessed the effect of brief psychological therapies, one assessed the impact of a self-help booklet, and one the effect of collaborative care. The disparate nature of the trials covering different patient populations, interventions and outcomes meant that it was not possible to pool data meaningfully across studies. There was no evidence of a protective effect of brief psychological therapy or educational booklets on preventing disability. There was evidence from one trial of a reduction in both post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depressive symptoms one month after injury in those who received a collaborative care intervention combined with a brief psycho-educational intervention, however this was not retained at follow up. Overall mental health status was the only disability outcome affected by any intervention. In three trials the psychosocial intervention had a detrimental effect on the mental health status of patients. This review provides no convincing evidence of the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for the prevention of disability following traumatic physical injury. Taken together, our findings cannot be considered as supporting the provision of psychosocial interventions to prevent aspects of disability arising from physical injury. However, these conclusions are based on a small number of disparate trials with small to moderate sample sizes and are therefore necessarily cautious. More research, using larger sample sizes, and similar interventions and patient populations to enable pooling of results, is needed before these findings can be confirmed.","Traumatic physical injury such as that resulting from road traffic accidents, falls and fires can cause high levels of subsequent disability in the person affected. This may include physical disability as a result of the initial injury and subsequent complications, mental health problems such as depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a result of the trauma of the event which caused the injury and the resulting physical and social problems, and social problems such as loss of social life and unemployment. It is therefore important to evaluate interventions which seek to prevent these adverse secondary outcomes. Psychosocial interventions, which include psychological therapies such as interpersonal counselling and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), and social interventions such as befriending, social support and self-help advice, delivered soon after the injury, may help to prevent these problems.
This review identified five randomised controlled trials, involving 756 participants, which evaluated psychosocial interventions for the prevention of disability following traumatic injury. No convincing evidence was found supporting the efficacy of these interventions. In particular, self-help booklets and interpersonal therapies had no effect on preventing disability. There was some evidence that a more complex intervention involving collaborative care reduced symptoms of depression and PTSD in the short but not the medium term. There was evidence from three trials that psychosocial interventions had a detrimental effect on mental health. Taken together, our findings cannot be taken as supporting the provision of psychosocial interventions to prevent aspects of disability arising from physical injury. These results suggest that future interventions should focus on screening patients at risk of poor outcomes and only treating those who develop subsequent problems. However, the strength of these conclusions is limited by the small size and varied nature of many of the trials, which means that their results cannot be pooled.",1060,psychosocial interventions; traumatic physical injury; disabling sequelae; physical disability; mental health problems; social functioning; collaborative care; post-traumatic stress disorder; depressive symptoms; psycho-educational intervention,What types of disabilities can traumatic physical injury cause?,Identify the primary purpose of evaluating psychosocial interventions in the context of traumatic injuries.,Select all of the following that are colors,Which psychosocial intervention showed short-term efficacy in reducing depressive symptoms?,Explain the overall finding regarding the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions after a traumatic injury.,Physical and mental health problems; Improved social interactions; Increased employment opportunities,Physical and mental health problems,To prevent adverse secondary outcomes; To reduce the cost of medical treatments; To enhance physical strength,To prevent adverse secondary outcomes,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Collaborative care intervention; Self-help booklet; Interpersonal therapy,Collaborative care intervention,No convincing evidence supports their efficacy; Effective in preventing all types of disability; Significantly improved physical recovery,No convincing evidence supports their efficacy
5b8dbff00c740e00019d861a,finetuned_6,Exercise training for bronchiectasis,"Bronchiectasis is characterised by excessive sputum production, chronic cough, and acute exacerbations and is associated with symptoms of dyspnoea and fatigue, which reduce exercise tolerance and impair quality of life. Exercise training in isolation or in conjunction with other interventions is beneficial for people with other respiratory diseases, but its effects in bronchiectasis have not been well established.
To determine effects of exercise training compared to usual care on exercise tolerance (primary outcome), quality of life (primary outcome), incidence of acute exacerbation and hospitalisation, respiratory and mental health symptoms, physical function, mortality, and adverse events in people with stable or acute exacerbation of bronchiectasis.
We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Specialised Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization trials portal, from their inception to October 2020. We reviewed respiratory conference abstracts and reference lists of all primary studies and review articles for additional references.
We included randomised controlled trials in which exercise training of at least four weeks' duration (or eight sessions) was compared to usual care for people with stable bronchiectasis or experiencing an acute exacerbation. Co-interventions with exercise training including education, respiratory muscle training, and airway clearance therapy were permitted if also applied as part of usual care.
Two review authors independently screened and selected trials for inclusion, extracted outcome data, and assessed risk of bias. We contacted study authors for missing data. We calculated mean differences (MDs) using a random-effects model. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence.
We included six studies, two of which were published as abstracts, with a total of 275 participants. Five studies were undertaken with people with clinically stable bronchiectasis, and one pilot study was undertaken post acute exacerbation. All studies included co-interventions such as instructions for airway clearance therapy and/or breathing strategies, provision of an educational booklet, and delivery of educational sessions. The duration of training ranged from six to eight weeks, with a mix of supervised and unsupervised sessions conducted in the outpatient or home setting. No studies of children were included in the review; however we identified two studies as currently ongoing. No data were available regarding physical activity levels or adverse events. For people with stable bronchiectasis, evidence suggests that exercise training compared to usual care improves functional exercise tolerance as measured by the incremental shuttle walk distance, with a mean difference (MD) between groups of 87 metres (95% confidence interval (CI) 43 to 132 metres; 4 studies, 161 participants; low-certainty evidence). Evidence also suggests that exercise training improves six-minute walk distance (6MWD) (MD between groups of 42 metres, 95% CI 22 to 62; 1 study, 76 participants; low-certainty evidence). The magnitude of these observed mean changes appears clinically relevant as they exceed minimal clinically important difference (MCID) thresholds for people with chronic lung disease. Evidence suggests that quality of life improves following exercise training according to St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score (MD -9.62 points, 95% CI -15.67 to -3.56 points; 3 studies, 160 participants; low-certainty evidence), which exceeds the MCID of 4 points for this outcome. A reduction in dyspnoea (MD 1.0 points, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.53; 1 study, 76 participants) and fatigue (MD 1.51 points, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.22 points; 1 study, 76 participants) was observed following exercise training according to these domains of the Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire. However, there was no change in cough-related quality of life as measured by the Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ) (MD -0.09 points, 95% CI -0.98 to 0.80 points; 2 studies, 103 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), nor in anxiety or depression. Two studies reported longer-term outcomes up to 12 months after intervention completion; however exercise training did not appear to improve exercise capacity or quality of life more than usual care. Exercise training reduced the number of acute exacerbations of bronchiectasis over 12 months in people with stable bronchiectasis (odds ratio 0.26, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.81; 1 study, 55 participants). After an acute exacerbation of bronchiectasis, data from a single study (N = 27) suggest that exercise training compared to usual care confers little to no effect on exercise capacity (MD 11 metres, 95% CI -27 to 49 metres; low-certainty evidence), SGRQ total score (MD 6.34 points, 95%CI -17.08 to 29.76 points), or LCQ score (MD -0.08 points, 95% CI -0.94 to 0.78 points; low-certainty evidence) and does not reduce the time to first exacerbation (hazard ratio 0.83, 95% CI 0.31 to 2.22).
This review provides low-certainty evidence suggesting improvement in functional exercise capacity and quality of life immediately following exercise training in people with stable bronchiectasis; however the effects of exercise training on cough-related quality of life and psychological symptoms appear to be minimal. Due to inadequate reporting of methods, small study numbers, and variation between study findings, evidence is of very low to moderate certainty. Limited evidence is available to show longer-term effects of exercise training on these outcomes.","We wanted to know whether exercise training improves exercise tolerance, quality of life, or symptoms, and whether it reduces the number of future flare-ups (exacerbations) in people with bronchiectasis compared to those who did not participate in exercise training. We examined studies involving people with stable disease as well as those recovering from a recent flare-up, aiming to include evidence for both children and adults, although no studies involving children were found. Bronchiectasis causes chronic cough and sputum production, and people with this condition have an increased risk of exacerbations that worsen exercise tolerance and quality of life. While exercise training benefits people with other chronic lung conditions, its effects in bronchiectasis are less well understood. The evidence is current up to October 2020 and includes six studies with 275 participants, five of which involved people with stable disease. Exercise training was delivered alongside other treatments such as airway clearance therapy, respiratory muscle training, and education. Participants were randomly assigned to either exercise training or no exercise training. Training lasted at least six weeks and took place either in group settings or at home. None of the studies were funded by commercial companies. After completing exercise training, participants in a stable condition walked farther than those who did not train, with an average increase of 87 meters, although certainty of evidence is low. Participants also reported improved quality of life, less shortness of breath, and reduced fatigue. Moderate-certainty evidence showed that exercise training might not specifically improve cough-related symptoms, but the incidence of acute exacerbations was lower. Evidence was insufficient to determine whether the benefits lasted beyond the training period or whether exercise training increased overall physical activity. No benefits were observed for people who began exercise training soon after an acute flare-up. The certainty of evidence ranged from very low to moderate due to uncertainty in effect size, limitations in study design, and insufficient data. More studies with larger sample sizes are needed to understand the long-term effects of exercise training in people with bronchiectasis regardless of their clinical stability.",1074,Bronchiectasis; sputum production; dyspnoea; exercise tolerance; acute exacerbations; Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire; Leicester Cough Questionnaire; airway clearance therapy; co-interventions; minimal clinically important difference,What conclusions can be drawn about the impact of exercise training on the quality of life in bronchiectasis patients according to the summary?,"Based on the summary, what challenges remain unresolved for exercise training in bronchiectasis?",Select all of the following that are fruits,What was the primary objective of the study?,Describe the effect of exercise training on exercise tolerance in stable bronchiectasis patients.,Exercise training significantly improves the quality of life for stable bronchiectasis patients.; The improvement in quality of life is indefinite and requires further study.; Exercise training did not improve the quality of life at all.,Exercise training significantly improves the quality of life for stable bronchiectasis patients.; The improvement in quality of life is indefinite and requires further study.,Long-term benefits beyond the training period.; Initial high cost of exercise programs.; Effectiveness for people after acute flare-ups.,Long-term benefits beyond the training period.; Effectiveness for people after acute flare-ups.,dog; blue; grape,grape,To determine the effects of exercise training in people with bronchiectasis; To analyze the dietary habits of bronchiectasis patients; To evaluate the economic impact of bronchiectasis,To determine the effects of exercise training in people with bronchiectasis,Increases exercise tolerance; Decreases exercise tolerance; No effect on exercise tolerance,Increases exercise tolerance
5b8dbff00c740e00019d861a,finetuned_6,"What are the benefits and harms of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs), the next-generation blood thinners, after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR)?","Balancing the risk of thromboembolism and bleeding after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) remains clinically challenging. Questions regarding the efficacy and safety of  non?vitamin  K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) after TAVR still need to be definitively answered.
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of NOACs after TAVR in individuals with and without indication for anticoagulation.
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP on 7 October 2023 together with reference checking and citation searching to identify additional studies.
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared NOACs versus antiplatelet therapy or vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) after TAVR in adults with or without an indication for anticoagulation.
We used standard Cochrane methods and conducted random-effects pair-wise analyses and network meta-analyses (NMAs). Our primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, stroke, and major bleeding. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence.
We included four RCTs with 4808 participants in the NMA. Of these, one compared rivaroxaban versus antiplatelet therapy in people without an indication for anticoagulation after TAVR; one compared apixaban versus antiplatelet therapy in people without an indication for anticoagulation or versus VKA in people with an indication for anticoagulation after TAVR; one compared edoxaban versus VKA in people with an indication for anticoagulation after TAVR; and one compared edoxaban with antiplatelet therapy in people without an indication for anticoagulation after TAVR. The mean age of trial participants was 81 years. Follow-up duration ranged from 6 to 18 months. Overall, we judged the risk of bias in the included trials to be low in all domains except for blinding, which was assessed as high in all four studies. No studies evaluated dabigatran. In peoplewithoutan indication for anticoagulation, rivaroxaban and apixaban may increase all-cause mortality after TAVR as compared to antiplatelet therapy (rivaroxaban: risk ratio (RR) 1.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13 to 2.46; studies = 1, participants = 1644; moderate-certainty evidence; apixaban: RR 1.71, 95% CI 0.97 to 3.02; studies = 1, participants = 1049; low-certainty evidence), while edoxaban may result in little or no difference (RR 1.59, 95% CI 0.27 to 9.36; studies = 1, participants = 229; low-certainty evidence). Low-certainty evidence suggests little or no difference between rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban and antiplatelet therapy in cardiovascular mortality (rivaroxaban: RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.10; studies = 1, participants = 1644; apixaban: RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.64 to 2.65; studies = 1, participants = 1049; edoxaban: RR 7.44, 95% CI 0.39 to 142.38; studies = 1, participants = 229) and between rivaroxaban or edoxaban and antiplatelets in stroke (rivaroxaban: RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.71 to 2.00; studies = 1, participants = 1644; edoxaban: RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.15 to 7.42; studies = 1, participants = 229). While rivaroxaban versus antiplatelets probably increases major bleeding after TAVR (RR 1.98, 95% CI 1.07 to 3.65; studies = 1, participants = 1644; moderate-certainty evidence), there may be little or no difference between apixaban and antiplatelet therapy (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.64; studies = 1, participants = 1049; low-certainty evidence). It is unclear if edoxaban has an effect on major bleeding, although the point estimate suggests increased bleeding (versus antiplatelets: RR 2.13, 95% CI 0.54 to 8.30; studies = 1, participants = 229; low-certainty evidence). In peoplewithan indication for anticoagulation, low-certainty evidence suggests apixaban or edoxaban may result in little to no difference in our predefined primary efficacy outcomes after TAVR when compared to VKA (all-cause mortality: apixaban: RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.77; studies = 1, participants = 451; edoxaban: RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.20; studies = 1, participants = 1426; cardiovascular mortality: apixaban: RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.76 to 2.70; studies = 1, participants = 451; edoxaban: RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.57; studies = 1, participants = 1426; stroke: apixaban: RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.35 to 4.70; studies = 1, participants = 451; edoxaban: RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.34; studies = 1, participants = 1426). While apixaban may result in a similar rate of bleeding as VKA in this population, edoxaban probably increases major bleeding after TAVR in people with an indication for anticoagulation (apixaban: RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.54; studies = 1, participants = 451; low-certainty evidence; edoxaban: RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.93; studies = 1, participants = 1426; moderate-certainty evidence).
In peoplewithoutan indication for oral anticoagulation, rivaroxaban and apixaban may increase all-cause mortality when compared to antiplatelet therapy, while edoxaban may result in little or no difference. There might be little or no difference between rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban and antiplatelet therapy in cardiovascular mortality, and between rivaroxaban or edoxaban and antiplatelets in stroke. While rivaroxaban probably increases major bleeding following TAVR, there might be little or no difference between apixaban and antiplatelet therapy, and the effect of edoxaban on major bleeding remains unclear. In peoplewithan indication for anticoagulation, apixaban and edoxaban may be as effective as VKA in preventing all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death, and stroke. Apixaban may lead to a similar rate of major bleeding as VKA in this population. However, edoxaban probably increases major bleeding following TAVR when compared to VKA. Our NMA did not show superiority of one NOAC over another for any of the primary outcomes. Head-to-head trials directly comparing NOACs against each other are required to increase the certainty of the evidence.","TAVR is a heart valve replacement procedure that does not require open-heart surgery. It uses a heart catheter to insert a new valve through a small surgical incision in the leg or chest. Choosing the best treatment for people after TAVR remains a challenge in clinical practice.
We looked at whether the next-generation blood thinners, non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs), are safer and more effective than antiplatelet drugs or vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), such as warfarin, after TAVR.
We searched for studies that looked at the benefits and harms of NOACs compared with antiplatelet therapy or VKA after TAVR.
We found five studies that compared three types of NOACs: rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, with antiplatelet drugs or warfarin, one of which is ongoing. Our review findings are based on the four completed studies involving 4808 participants.
We found that in people who did not have a medical reason to take blood thinners, the NOACs rivaroxaban and apixaban may increase the risk of death for any reason compared to antiplatelet therapy, while edoxaban appears to have little or no effect. Any differences between rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban, and antiplatelet therapy in death caused by diseases of the heart or blood vessels are likely small. Similarly, differences between rivaroxaban or edoxaban and antiplatelets in stroke are also likely small. In these people, the risk of serious bleeding is probably increased with rivaroxaban; however, there seems to be little or no difference between apixaban and antiplatelet therapy, and we are uncertain about the impact of edoxaban on serious bleeding.
In people who have a medical reason to take blood thinners, we found that apixaban and edoxaban may be as effective as warfarin in preventing death for any reason, death caused by diseases of the heart or blood vessels, and stroke. Apixaban may result in a similar rate of serious bleeding as warfarin, whereas edoxaban probably increases the rate of serious bleeding compared to warfarin.
We are uncertain if any one type of NOAC is better than another. More research is needed to know for sure.
We have little confidence in the evidence for apixaban and edoxaban because the included studies were small. We are only moderately confident in some of the evidence for rivaroxaban, also due to the small size of studies.

62aa4399fa1aadf5ab91fff8,static_1,Exercise-based rehabilitation for coronary heart disease,"Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the most common cause of death globally. However, with falling CHD mortality rates, an increasing number of people living with CHD may need support to manage their symptoms and prognosis. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) aims to improve the health and outcomes of people with CHD. This is an update of a Cochrane Review previously published in 2016. To assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of exercise-based CR (exercise training alone or in combination with psychosocial or educational interventions) compared with 'no exercise' control, on mortality, morbidity and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in people with CHD. We updated searches from the previous Cochrane Review, by searching CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two other databases in September 2020. We also searched two clinical trials registers in June 2021. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of exercise-based interventions with at least six months follow-up, compared with 'no exercise' control. The study population comprised adult men and women who have had a myocardial infarction (MI), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), or have angina pectoris, or coronary artery disease. We screened all identified references, extracted data and assessed risk of bias according to Cochrane methods. We stratified meta-analysis by duration of follow-up: short-term (6 to 12 months); medium-term (> 12 to 36 months); and long-term (> 3 years), and used meta-regression to explore potential treatment effect modifiers. We used GRADE for primary outcomes at 6 to 12 months (the most common follow-up time point). This review included 85 trials which randomised 23,430 people with CHD. This latest update identified 22 new trials (7795 participants). The population included predominantly post-MI and post-revascularisation patients, with a mean age ranging from 47 to 77 years. In the last decade, the median percentage of women with CHD has increased from 11% to 17%, but females still account for a similarly small percentage of participants recruited overall (< 15%). Twenty-one of the included trials were performed in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Overall trial reporting was poor, although there was evidence of an improvement in quality over the last decade. The median longest follow-up time was 12 months (range 6 months to 19 years). At short-term follow-up (6 to 12 months), exercise-based CR likely results in a slight reduction in all-cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 1.04; 25 trials; moderate certainty evidence), a large reduction in MI (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.93; 22 trials; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 75, 95% CI 47 to 298; high certainty evidence), and a large reduction in all-cause hospitalisation (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.77; 14 trials; NNTB 12, 95% CI 9 to 21; moderate certainty evidence). Exercise-based CR likely results in little to no difference in risk of cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.14; 15 trials; moderate certainty evidence), CABG (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.27; 20 trials; high certainty evidence), and PCI (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.19; 13 trials; moderate certainty evidence) up to 12 months' follow-up. We are uncertain about the effects of exercise-based CR on cardiovascular hospitalisation, with a wide confidence interval including considerable benefit as well as harm (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.59; low certainty evidence). There was evidence of substantial heterogeneity across trials for cardiovascular hospitalisations ( I²= 53%), and of small study bias for all-cause hospitalisation, but not for all other outcomes. At medium-term follow-up, although there may be little to no difference in all-cause mortality (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.02; 15 trials), MI (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.27; 12 trials), PCI (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.35; 6 trials), CABG (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.23; 9 trials), and all-cause hospitalisation (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.03; 9 trials), a large reduction in cardiovascular mortality was found (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.93; 5 trials). Evidence is uncertain for difference in risk of cardiovascular hospitalisation (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.12; 3 trials). At long-term follow-up, although there may be little to no difference in all-cause mortality (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.10), exercise-based CR may result in a large reduction in cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.78; 8 trials) and MI (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.90; 10 trials). Evidence is uncertain for CABG (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.27; 4 trials), and PCI (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.20; 3 trials). Meta-regression showed benefits in outcomes were independent of CHD case mix, type of CR, exercise dose, follow-up length, publication year, CR setting, study location, sample size or risk of bias. There was evidence that exercise-based CR may slightly increase HRQoL across several subscales (SF-36 mental component, physical functioning, physical performance, general health, vitality, social functioning and mental health scores) up to 12 months' follow-up; however, these may not be clinically important differences. The eight trial-based economic evaluation studies showed exercise-based CR to be a potentially cost-effective use of resources in terms of gain in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). This updated Cochrane Review supports the conclusions of the previous version, that exercise-based CR provides important benefits to people with CHD, including reduced risk of MI, a likely small reduction in all-cause mortality, and a large reduction in all-cause hospitalisation, along with associated healthcare costs, and improved HRQoL up to 12 months' follow-up. Over longer-term follow-up, benefits may include reductions in cardiovascular mortality and MI. In the last decade, trials were more likely to include females, and be undertaken in LMICs, increasing the generalisability of findings. Well-designed, adequately-reported RCTs of CR in people with CHD more representative of usual clinical practice are still needed. Trials should explicitly report clinical outcomes, including mortality and hospital admissions, and include validated HRQoL outcome measures, especially over longer-term follow-up, and assess costs and cost-effectiveness.","Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the single most common cause of death globally. However, with falling CHD mortality rates, an increasing number of people live with CHD and may need support to manage their symptoms (such as angina, shortness of breath with physical activity, and fatigue) and reduce the chances of future problems, such as heart attacks. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (exercise training alone or in combination with psychological or educational interventions) aims to improve the health and outcomes of people with CHD. We searched the scientific literature for randomised controlled trials (experiments that randomly allocate participants to one of two or more treatment groups) looking at the effectiveness of exercise-based treatments compared with no exercise in people of all ages with CHD. The evidence is current to September 2020. This latest update identified an additional 22 trials (7795 participants). We included a total of 85 trials that studied 23,430 people with CHD, predominantly heart attack survivors and those who had undergone heart bypass surgery or angioplasty (a procedure which widens narrowed or obstructed arteries or veins). Thirty-eight (45%) of the trials involved exercise-only interventions and 47 (55%) involved interventions with exercise plus other components. The type of exercise most often included was stationary cycling, walking or circuit training. Twenty-one (25%) of the interventions were delivered in the participants' homes. The findings of this update are consistent with the previous (2016) version of this Cochrane Review, and show important benefits of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation that include a reduction in the risk of death due to any cause, heart attack, and hospital admission, and improvements in health-related quality of life, compared with not undertaking exercise. A small body of economic evidence was identified, indicating exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation to be cost-effective. Many of the studies identified in this current update were undertaken in low- and middle-income countries, which increases the generalisability of our results to these settings where levels of CHD are high and continue to increase.

62aa4399fa1aadf5ab91fff8,static_2,Does taxation of unprocessed sugar or foods with added sugar reduce their consumption and prevent obesity or other adverse health outcomes?,"Global prevalence of overweight and obesity are alarming. For tackling this public health problem, preventive public health and policy actions are urgently needed. Some countries implemented food taxes in the past and some were subsequently abolished. Some countries, such as Norway, Hungary, Denmark, Bermuda, Dominica, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and the Navajo Nation (USA), specifically implemented taxes on unprocessed sugar and sugar-added foods. These taxes on unprocessed sugar and sugar-added foods are fiscal policy interventions, implemented to decrease their consumption and in turn reduce adverse health-related, economic and social effects associated with these food products. To assess the effects of taxation of unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods in the general population on the consumption of unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods, the prevalence and incidence of overweight and obesity, and the prevalence and incidence of other diet-related health outcomes. We searched CENTRAL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, Embase and 15 other databases and trials registers on 12 September 2019. We handsearched the reference list of all records of included studies, searched websites of international organisations and institutions, and contacted review advisory group members to identify planned, ongoing or unpublished studies. We included studies with the following populations: children (0 to 17 years) and adults (18 years or older) from any country and setting. Exclusion applied to studies with specific subgroups, such as people with any disease who were overweight or obese as a side-effect of the disease. The review included studies with taxes on or artificial increases of selling prices for unprocessed sugar or food products that contain added sugar (e.g. sweets, ice cream, confectionery, and bakery products), or both, as intervention, regardless of the taxation level or price increase. In line with Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) criteria, we included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-randomised controlled trials (cRCTs), non-randomised controlled trials (nRCTs), controlled before-after (CBA) studies, and interrupted time series (ITS) studies. We included controlled studies with more than one intervention or control site and ITS studies with a clearly defined intervention time and at least three data points before and three after the intervention. Our primary outcomes were consumption of unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods, energy intake, overweight, and obesity. Our secondary outcomes were substitution and diet, expenditure, demand, and other health outcomes. Two review authors independently screened all eligible records for inclusion, assessed the risk of bias, and performed data extraction.Two review authors independently assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We retrieved a total of 24,454 records. After deduplicating records, 18,767 records remained for title and abstract screening. Of 11 potentially relevant studies, we included one ITS study with 40,210 household-level observations from the Hungarian Household Budget and Living Conditions Survey. The baseline ranged from January 2008 to August 2011, the intervention was implemented on September 2011, and follow-up was until December 2012 (16 months). The intervention was a tax - the so-called 'Hungarian public health product tax' - on sugar-added foods, including selected foods exceeding a specific sugar threshold value. The intervention includes co-interventions: the taxation of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) and of foods high in salt or caffeine. The study provides evidence on the effect of taxing foods exceeding a specific sugar threshold value on the consumption of sugar-added foods. After implementation of the Hungarian public health product tax, the mean consumption of taxed sugar-added foods (measured in units of kg) decreased by 4.0% (standardised mean difference (SMD) ?0.040, 95% confidence interval (CI) ?0.07 to ?0.01; very low-certainty evidence). The study was at low risk of bias in terms of performance bias, detection bias and reporting bias, with the shape of effect pre-specified and the intervention unlikely to have any effect on data collection. The study was at unclear risk of attrition bias and at high risk in terms of other bias and the independence of the intervention. We rated the certainty of the evidence as very low for the primary and secondary outcomes. The Hungarian public health product tax included a tax on sugar-added foods but did not include a tax on unprocessed sugar. We did not find eligible studies reporting on the taxation of unprocessed sugar. No studies reported on the primary outcomes of consumption of unprocessed sugar, energy intake, overweight, and obesity. No studies reported on the secondary outcomes of substitution and diet, demand, and other health outcomes. No studies reported on differential effects across population subgroups. We could not perform meta-analyses or pool study results. There was very limited evidence and the certainty of the evidence was very low. Despite the reported reduction in consumption of taxed sugar-added foods, we are uncertain whether taxing unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods has an effect on reducing their consumption and preventing obesity or other adverse health outcomes. Further robustly conducted studies are required to draw concrete conclusions on the effectiveness of taxing unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods for reducing their consumption and preventing obesity or other adverse health outcomes.","As outlined by the World Health Organization, 'globesity' (the rise in overweight and obesity globally) is a major world challenge. A sugar-rich diet, especially when combined with physical inactivity, may cause overweight and obesity, and other harmful health outcomes. There are direct costs to healthcare services of people being overweight or obese, such as preventing and treating health problems that this causes. There are also costs to society as a whole when people who are ill through being overweight or obese are unable to work. This review may be of interest to government public health agencies, policy decision-makers, food retailers, and food industries. This review and subsequent updates of this review may change policy and affect a government's motivation to create a tax on unprocessed sugar and foods with added sugar. It also may motivate food industries to reformulate their products to contain lower levels of added sugar. We wanted to know if taxation of unprocessed sugar and foods with added sugar (other than sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs)) reduced their consumption, changed people's energy intake, and reduced overweight and obesity. We also wanted to know if taxation changed people's diet and spending, and had an effect on other diet-related health problems. We searched for ongoing or published studies up to October 2019. Of a total of 24,454 records retrieved, we identified one 'interrupted time series' (ITS) study meeting our eligibility criteria to assess the impact of a tax on sugar-added foods (but not unprocessed sugar). The study used data from the Hungarian Household Budget and Living Conditions Survey, with observations from 40,210 households. Evidence from the study included a 'baseline' (the situation before taxation), ranging from January 2008 to August 2011. The Hungarian public health product tax was implemented on September 2011. The duration of the follow-up period (measuring the effects of taxation) was 16 months. The study was funded by the Scottish Institute for Research in Economics (SIRE) Early Career Engagement Grant. The included study provided very limited evidence that taxing foods with added sugar reduced their consumption by 4%. We are very uncertain about this evidence because the study did not use the strongest methods, looked at other kinds of taxation as well as taxing foods with added sugar, and may not have correctly classified food types. We are uncertain whether taxing foods with added sugar has an effect on reducing their consumption. The included study did not investigate the effects of taxing unprocessed sugar. Further research is needed to assess the effectiveness of taxing unprocessed sugar or foods with added sugar for reducing their consumption and preventing obesity or other adverse health outcomes. Studies should take place in countries that have implemented these taxes and should look at cost-effectiveness as well as the health benefits of taxing unprocessed sugar or foods with added sugar as a public health policy for preventing overweight, obesity or other adverse health outcomes. Countries that have implemented these taxes are Bermuda, Dominica, Hungary, India, Norway, the Navajo Nation (USA), and St. Vincent and Grenadines.",1103,overweight and obesity; preventive public health; fiscal policy interventions; Hungarian public health product tax; sugar-sweetened beverages; very low-certainty evidence; consumption of sugar-added foods; prevalence and incidence; demand and other health outcomes,Evaluate the impact of sugar taxation on public health policy motivation.,What potential effects on food reformulation might result from this study's findings?,Select all of the following that are fruits,Analyze the reasons for including various countries with implemented sugar taxes in the study.,Judge the reliability of the study based on the methods used to assess sugar consumption reduction.,It may motivate policy changes to implement sugar taxes.; It provides conclusive evidence to halt all sugar taxes.; It discourages future research on sugar taxation policies.,It may motivate policy changes to implement sugar taxes.,Industries could reduce added sugar in products.; Industries might eliminate all sugar from products.; Industries will increase sugar content to boost sales.,Industries could reduce added sugar in products.,dog; blue; grape,grape,To provide a comprehensive review of international tax efficacy.; To identify global trends in sugar consumption reduction.; To facilitate the exploration of diverse tax-related health outcomes.,To facilitate the exploration of diverse tax-related health outcomes.,The methods used were robust and reliable.; The study lacked strong methods and classifications.; The reliability was high due to the large sample size.,The study lacked strong methods and classifications.
62aa4399fa1aadf5ab91fff8,static_2,Fixed-dose combination drug therapy for the prevention of heart disease and stroke,"Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) remains the leading cause of death and disability worldwide, yet many people still do not receive adequate treatment to control their risk factors. One strategy proposed to help address this gap is the use of a fixed-dose combination pill often called a polypill that combines blood pressure-lowering drugs, cholesterol-lowering medication, and sometimes antiplatelet therapy into a single tablet taken daily. This review evaluated whether such fixed-dose combination therapy leads to fewer deaths, fewer heart attacks and strokes, improved adherence to medication, and better control of cardiovascular risk factors compared with usual care, placebo, or taking medications separately. We included 13 randomised controlled trials involving a total of 9059 adults; four of these trials were new additions in this update. Most studies involved people without established ASCVD, and follow-up ranged from six weeks to nearly two years. Participants were generally in their early 60s, and about one-third were women. Newer studies tended to be larger, longer, and had a lower risk of bias. However, a major limitation across all trials was the inability to blind participants or researchers to the treatment since the fixed-dose pill differs visibly from usual care, which could influence reported outcomes. Overall, the effects of fixed-dose combination therapy on important clinical outcomes, such as death or major cardiovascular events, remain uncertain. About 1% of participants in both the fixed-dose and control groups died during the trials, showing no clear difference (risk ratio 1.10, 95% confidence interval 0.64 to 1.89). Similarly, the proportion of people who experienced a heart attack or stroke was small (4.7% in the fixed-dose group versus 3.7% in the control group), and the evidence did not show a clear effect (risk ratio 1.26, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.66). These findings are limited by the low number of events and the fact that most trials focused on risk factor changes rather than long-term outcomes. Side effects occurred commonly in both groups, but people taking the fixed-dose pill were somewhat more likely to report an adverse event (32% versus 27%), meaning a 16% increased risk. This is not unexpected since the polypill combines several medications known to cause side effects individually. Despite this, the fixed-dose combination showed consistent improvements in risk factor control. On average, systolic blood pressure was lowered by about 6 mmHg compared with usual care, and LDL cholesterol dropped by approximately 0.70 mmol/L. Total cholesterol also decreased modestly. However, these results showed substantial statistical variation between trials, so they should be interpreted cautiously. A key advantage of fixed-dose combination therapy was improved medication adherence. Across four studies, adherence to treatment was 44% higher among participants taking the polypill than among those receiving usual care. This suggests that simplifying treatment into a single pill may help more people take their medications consistently. In summary, while fixed-dose combination therapy improves blood pressure, cholesterol, and adherence, current evidence is insufficient to determine whether it reduces heart attacks, strokes, or deaths. Most trials were not designed or powered to assess these major outcomes, which likely explains the lack of clear effects. Fixed-dose therapy does appear to increase minor side effects but may help patients stay on treatment better. Ongoing and longer-term studies will be critical to determine whether the improvements in risk factors observed with polypill therapy eventually translate into meaningful reductions in cardiovascular events.","We examined the evidence on whether using fixed-dose combination drug therapy can help prevent heart attacks and strokes. This approach combines several medications typically drugs that lower blood pressure and cholesterol into a single pill. We identified 13 studies involving 9059 adults. The evidence is current up to September 2016. Researchers wanted to know if taking multiple preventive medications in a single pill was better or worse than usual care, placebo, or taking each drug separately. This updated review includes studies published since the previous Cochrane Review from 2014. Four of the included studies involved people who already had a previous heart attack or stroke, or who were at high risk of having one. Five studies followed participants for 12 months or longer. Most of the participants were middle-aged men with moderately high blood pressure or cholesterol levels, and two studies specifically included large numbers of Aboriginal or Maori participants. The fixed-dose pills in these trials contained between two and five medications, but all combinations included at least one drug to lower blood pressure and one to lower cholesterol. A major limitation across studies was that neither the participants nor the researchers could be blinded to the treatment, which could influence the results. The findings showed that it is still uncertain whether fixed-dose combination therapy reduces the risk of death, heart attacks, or strokes. Very few participants in the trials experienced these events less than 5% making it difficult to determine the true effect. The comparison with usual care also provided low-quality evidence, meaning confidence in these results is limited. Participants taking fixed-dose combination pills experienced more side effects compared with those in the control groups (32% versus 27%). This is expected because the medications involved such as aspirin, blood pressure-lowering drugs, and cholesterol-lowering drugsare known to cause side effects when taken individually. The combined pill may slightly reduce blood pressure by about 6 mmHg and lower LDL cholesterol by approximately 0.6 mmol/L, though these benefits were not seen consistently across all studies. Importantly, fixed-dose combination therapy did improve how regularly people took their preventive medications, suggesting better adherence overall. The overall quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to low, meaning that while some findings are fairly reliable, others remain uncertain. Ongoing and future clinical trials using fixed-dose combination therapy are expected to provide clearer evidence about its impact on major outcomes such as heart attacks, strokes, and deaths.",1048,Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; fixed-dose combination therapy; antiplatelet therapy; LDL cholesterol; systolic blood pressure; cardiovascular risk factors; placebo; cholesterol-lowering medication; blood pressure-lowering drugs; major cardiovascular events,How do the reported side effects of fixed-dose combination pills compare with usual care?,Which methodological limitations could affect the reliability of the studyÃ¢ÂÂs findings?,Select the items that are animals,"According to the findings, how did fixed-dose combination therapy affect medication adherence?",What effect did the fixed-dose combination pill have on blood pressure?,They are more frequent in the fixed-dose combination group.; They occur less frequently than in usual care.; The side effects are unrelated to the medications used.,They are more frequent in the fixed-dose combination group.,The inability to blind participants and researchers to treatment.; The inclusion of both men and women in the study.; The length of the follow-up period in some studies.,The inability to blind participants and researchers to treatment.; The length of the follow-up period in some studies.,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,It significantly improved adherence by simplifying treatment.; It reduced adherence due to increased side effects.; It had no impact on adherence as it was similar to usual care.,It significantly improved adherence by simplifying treatment.,It reduced systolic blood pressure by about 6 mmHg.; It increased systolic blood pressure by 5 mmHg.; It had no measurable impact on blood pressure.,It reduced systolic blood pressure by about 6 mmHg.
62aa4399fa1aadf5ab91fff8,interactive_3,Quality improvement strategies for diabetes care: Effects on outcomes for adults living with diabetes,"There is a large body of evidence evaluating quality improvement (QI) programmes to improve care for adults living with diabetes. These programmes are often comprised of multiple QI strategies, which may be implemented in various combinations. Decision-makers planning to implement or evaluate a new QI programme, or both, need reliable evidence on the relative effectiveness of different QI strategies (individually and in combination) for different patient populations.
To update existing systematic reviews of diabetes QI programmes and apply novel meta-analytical techniques to estimate the effectiveness of QI strategies (individually and in combination) on diabetes quality of care.
We searched databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL) and trials registers (ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP) to 4 June 2019. We conducted a top-up search to 23 September 2021; we screened these search results and 42 studies meeting our eligibility criteria are available in the awaiting classification section.
We included randomised trials that assessed a QI programme to improve care in outpatient settings for people living with diabetes. QI programmes needed to evaluate at least one system- or provider-targeted QI strategy alone or in combination with a patient-targeted strategy. - System-targeted: case management (CM); team changes (TC); electronic patient registry (EPR); facilitated relay of clinical information (FR); continuous quality improvement (CQI). - Provider-targeted: audit and feedback (AF); clinician education (CE); clinician reminders (CR); financial incentives (FI). - Patient-targeted: patient education (PE); promotion of self-management (PSM); patient reminders (PR). Patient-targeted QI strategies needed to occur with a minimum of one provider or system-targeted strategy.
We dual-screened search results and abstracted data on study design, study population and QI strategies. We assessed the impact of the programmes on 13 measures of diabetes care, including: glycaemic control (e.g. mean glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c)); cardiovascular risk factor management (e.g. mean systolic blood pressure (SBP), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), proportion of people living with diabetes that quit smoking or receiving cardiovascular medications); and screening/prevention of microvascular complications (e.g. proportion of patients receiving retinopathy or foot screening); and harms (e.g. proportion of patients experiencing adverse hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia). We modelled the association of each QI strategy with outcomes using a series of hierarchical multivariable meta-regression models in a Bayesian framework. The previous version of this review identified that different strategies were more or less effective depending on baseline levels of outcomes. To explore this further, we extended the main additive model for continuous outcomes (HbA1c, SBP and LDL-C) to include an interaction term between each strategy and average baseline risk for each study (baseline thresholds were based on a data-driven approach; we used the median of all baseline values reported in the trials). Based on model diagnostics, the baseline interaction models for HbA1c, SBP and LDL-C performed better than the main model and are therefore presented as the primary analyses for these outcomes. Based on the model results, we qualitatively ordered each QI strategy within three tiers (Top, Middle, Bottom) based on its magnitude of effect relative to the other QI strategies, where 'Top' indicates that the QI strategy was likely one of the most effective strategies for that specific outcome. Secondary analyses explored the sensitivity of results to choices in model specification and priors. Additional information about the methods and results of the review are available as Appendices in an online repository. This review will be maintained as a living systematic review; we will update our syntheses as more data become available.
We identified 553 trials (428 patient-randomised and 125 cluster-randomised trials), including a total of 412,161 participants. Of the included studies, 66% involved people living with type 2 diabetes only. Participants were 50% female and the median age of participants was 58.4 years. The mean duration of follow-up was 12.5 months. HbA1c was the commonest reported outcome; screening outcomes and outcomes related to cardiovascular medications, smoking and harms were reported infrequently. The most frequently evaluated QI strategies across all study arms were PE, PSM and CM, while the least frequently evaluated QI strategies included AF, FI and CQI. Our confidence in the evidence is limited due to a lack of information on how studies were conducted. Four QI strategies (CM, TC, PE, PSM) were consistently identified as 'Top' across the majority of outcomes. All QI strategies were ranked as 'Top' for at least one key outcome. The majority of effects of individual QI strategies were modest, but when used in combination could result in meaningful population-level improvements across the majority of outcomes. The median number of QI strategies in multicomponent QI programmes was three. Combinations of the three most effective QI strategies were estimated to lead to the below effects: - PR + PSM + CE: decrease in HbA1c by 0.41% (credibility interval (CrI) -0.61 to -0.22) when baseline HbA1c < 8.3%; - CM + PE + EPR: decrease in HbA1c by 0.62% (CrI -0.84 to -0.39) when baseline HbA1c > 8.3%; - PE + TC + PSM: reduction in SBP by 2.14 mmHg (CrI -3.80 to -0.52) when baseline SBP < 136 mmHg; - CM + TC + PSM: reduction in SBP by 4.39 mmHg (CrI -6.20 to -2.56) when baseline SBP > 136 mmHg; - TC + PE + CM: LDL-C lowering of 5.73 mg/dL (CrI -7.93 to -3.61) when baseline LDL < 107 mg/dL; - TC + CM + CR: LDL-C lowering by 5.52 mg/dL (CrI -9.24 to -1.89) when baseline LDL > 107 mg/dL. Assuming a baseline screening rate of 50%, the three most effective QI strategies were estimated to lead to an absolute improvement of 33% in retinopathy screening (PE + PR + TC) and 38% absolute increase in foot screening (PE + TC + Other).
There is a significant body of evidence about QI programmes to improve the management of diabetes. Multicomponent QI programmes for diabetes care (comprised of effective QI strategies) may achieve meaningful population-level improvements across the majority of outcomes. For health system decision-makers, the evidence summarised in this review can be used to identify strategies to include in QI programmes. For researchers, this synthesis identifies higher-priority QI strategies to examine in further research regarding how to optimise their evaluation and effects. We will maintain this as a living systematic review.","Diabetes, a disorder of how sugar is managed by the body, can lead to complications such as heart disease and blindness. If people with diabetes get the best possible treatment, their risk for these and other diabetes-related complications will be lowered. Unfortunately, many people with diabetes do not get the best possible treatment.
Quality improvement programmes using different strategies help healthcare professionals improve care. We examined 12 common types of quality improvement strategies.
- Four strategies were directed at healthcare professionals: audit and feedback, clinician education, clinician reminders and financial incentives.
- Three strategies were directed at people living with diabetes: patient education, patient reminders and promotion of self-management.
- Five strategies involved healthcare organisations: case management, team changes, electronic patient registry, facilitated relay of clinical information and continuous quality improvement.
We wanted to find out which strategies worked best to improve:
- blood sugar control (measured using a test called glycated haemoglobin or HbA1c);
- blood pressure;
- low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C).
Lower levels on these tests are associated with lower rates of complications such as heart attacks.
We also assessed whether quality improvement strategies improved rates of screening for eye damage (also known as retinopathy) and loss of sensation in the foot (also known as neuropathy). Routine screening for these issues in people living with diabetes is recommended to prevent blindness or amputation, respectively.
We searched for randomised trials including adults living with diabetes managed in outpatient settings, which evaluated at least one quality improvement strategy. Although we were interested in strategies directed at people living with diabetes, patient strategies needed to be tested in combination with strategies directed at healthcare organisations or professionals for the study to be included. We summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods, size and other considerations.
We found 553 studies that involved 412,161 people with diabetes up to the year 2019. Studies took place in countries around the world with most being conducted in the USA (231) and in medical settings.
Most studies (367) involved people with type 2 diabetes. Half of the study participants were female. The average age of participants was 57 years. Most studies lasted 12 months.
Studies usually used multiple quality improvement strategies together. Most commonly, studies featured three quality improvement strategies.
Overall, case management, team changes, patient education and promotion of self-management appeared to be the most effective quality improvement strategies for diabetes care.
When considering three-strategy combinations (the median number of quality improvement strategies in multicomponent interventions), the combination of clinician education, promotion of self-management and patient reminders may lead to the most improvement in blood sugar control in people who begin with lower HbA1c. Whereas the combination of case management, patient education and electronic patient registries may lead to the largest improvement in blood sugar control for people who begin with higher HbA1c.
For blood pressure, people who have lower systolic blood pressure may see the most improvement with the combination of patient education, team changes and promotion of self-management. People who have higher systolic blood pressure may improve the most with the combination of case management, team changes and promotion of self-management.
For cholesterol, we found that team changes, patient education and case management may lead to the most improvement in people who already have lower low-density lipoprotein levels. For those who have higher levels of low-density lipoprotein, team changes, case management and clinician reminders may lead to the largest improvement.
Patient education, patient reminders and team changes may lead to an increase in retinopathy screening rates. Patient education, team changes and audit and feedback, financial incentives and continuous quality improvement strategies combined may lead to an increase in foot screening rates.
Clinics can improve their diabetes care by engaging in quality improvement programmes (especially those including case management, team changes, patient education and patient self-management).
Many studies did not provide information on everything we were interested in. Most focused on blood sugar control and few studies reported screening rates. We included studies in this review that had important flaws in the way they were conducted, which limits how confident we can be in our findings.
The evidence for this review is up-to-date to June 2019, and we have further searched for and screened studies up to September 2021.

62aa4399fa1aadf5ab91fff8,interactive_4,Do physical measures such as hand-washing or wearing masks stop or slow down the spread of respiratory viruses?,"Viral epidemics or pandemics of acute respiratory infections (ARIs) pose a global threat, such as the influenza (H1N1) pandemic in 2009 caused by the H1N1pdm09 virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 in 2019, and antiviral drugs and vaccines may be insufficient to prevent their spread; this is an update of a Cochrane Review last published in 2020 and includes results from studies conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. The objective was to assess the effectiveness of physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of acute respiratory viruses. We searched CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and two trials registers in October 2022, with backward and forward citation analysis. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-RCTs investigating physical interventions (screening at entry ports, isolation, quarantine, physical distancing, personal protection, hand hygiene, face masks, glasses, and gargling) to prevent respiratory virus transmission, and used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We included 11 new RCTs and cluster-RCTs (610,872 participants), bringing the total to 78; six were conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic (two from Mexico, and one each from Denmark, Bangladesh, England, and Norway), and we identified four ongoing studies, one completed but unreported, evaluating masks during COVID-19. Many studies were conducted during non-epidemic influenza periods, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, or influenza seasons up to 2016, meaning many occurred under lower viral circulation compared with COVID-19; settings varied widely, from suburban schools to hospital wards in high-income countries, crowded inner-city areas in low-income countries, and an immigrant neighbourhood in a high-income country, and adherence to interventions was low in many studies, with risk of bias mostly high or unclear. We included 12 trials comparing medical/surgical masks versus no masks (two in healthcare workers and 10 in the community); wearing masks in the community probably makes little or no difference in influenza-like illness/COVID-like illness compared to not wearing masks (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.09; 9 trials, 276,917 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and probably makes little or no difference in laboratory-confirmed influenza/SARS-CoV-2 (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.42; 6 trials, 13,919 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), with harms rarely measured. For N95/P2 respirators compared to medical/surgical masks, pooled trials (four in healthcare settings and one in a household) show very uncertain effects on clinical respiratory illness (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.10; 3 trials, 7779 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and they may be effective for ILI (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.03; 5 trials, 8407 participants; low-certainty evidence); for laboratory-confirmed influenza, N95/P2 respirators probably make little or no difference (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.34; 5 trials, 8407 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Restricting analyses to healthcare workers made no difference; harms were poorly measured, though discomfort was reported. One recently published RCT found medical/surgical masks non-inferior to N95 respirators in 1009 healthcare workers across four countries treating COVID-19 patients. For hand hygiene, 19 trials compared interventions with controls across schools, childcare centres, and homes; hand hygiene resulted in a 14% relative reduction in ARIs (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.90; 9 trials, 52,105 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), reducing cases from 380 to 327 per 1000 people. For ILI (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.09; 11 trials, 34,503 participants; low-certainty evidence) and laboratory-confirmed influenza (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.30; 8 trials, 8332 participants; low-certainty evidence), effects suggested little or no difference. Pooled data from 19 trials (71,210 participants) for ARI/ILI/influenza found hand hygiene may be beneficial with an 11% relative reduction (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.94; low-certainty evidence), though with high heterogeneity; harms were rarely reported. No RCTs were found for gowns and gloves, face shields, or screening at entry ports. The high risk of bias, variation in outcome measurement, and low adherence hinder firm conclusions; additional RCTs during the pandemic existed but were relatively few despite the importance of evaluating masking and adherence, especially in vulnerable groups. There remains uncertainty about the effects of face masks, with low to moderate certainty meaning confidence is limited and true effects may differ; pooled RCTs did not show a clear reduction in respiratory viral infection with medical/surgical masks, and no clear difference was seen between medical/surgical masks and N95/P2 respirators in healthcare workers providing routine care. Hand hygiene is likely to modestly reduce respiratory illness, though not significantly for ILI or laboratory-confirmed influenza. Harms were under-investigated. There is a need for large, well-designed RCTs across multiple settings and populations to evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions and the impact of adherence, especially among those at highest risk of ARIs.","Respiratory viruses are viruses that infect the cells in your airways: nose, throat, and lungs and these infections can cause serious problems and affect normal breathing, leading to illnesses such as flu (influenza), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and COVID-19. People infected with a respiratory virus spread virus particles into the air when they cough or sneeze, and others become infected if they come into contact with these particles in the air or on surfaces; respiratory viruses can spread quickly through communities, populations, countries (causing epidemics), and around the world (causing pandemics). Physical measures to try to prevent respiratory viruses spreading include washing hands often; not touching your eyes, nose, or mouth; sneezing or coughing into your elbow; wiping surfaces with disinfectant; wearing masks, eye protection, gloves, and gowns; avoiding contact with other people (isolation or quarantine); keeping a distance from others; and screening people entering a country for signs of infection. We wanted to find out whether physical measures stop or slow the spread of respiratory viruses from well-controlled randomised controlled trials comparing one intervention to another. We searched for randomised controlled studies that looked at physical measures to stop people acquiring a respiratory virus infection and were interested in how many people caught a respiratory virus infection and whether the physical measures had unwanted effects. We identified 78 relevant studies conducted in low-, middle-, and high-income countries in hospitals, schools, homes, offices, childcare centres, and communities during non-epidemic influenza periods, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, influenza seasons up to 2016, and during the COVID-19 pandemic; five ongoing, unpublished studies were found, two evaluating masks for COVID-19, with five trials funded by government and pharmaceutical companies, and nine funded by pharmaceutical companies. No studies looked at face shields, gowns and gloves, or screening at borders. We assessed the effects of medical or surgical masks, N95/P2 respirators (close-fitting masks filtering inhaled air, mostly used by healthcare workers), and hand hygiene (hand-washing or hand sanitiser). For medical or surgical masks, ten studies took place in the community and two in healthcare workers; compared with wearing no mask (community studies only), wearing a mask may make little to no difference in how many people caught a flu-like or COVID-like illness (9 studies; 276,917 people), and probably makes little or no difference in how many had flu or COVID confirmed by a lab test (6 studies; 13,919 people), with discomfort rarely reported. For N95/P2 respirators, four studies were in healthcare workers and one small study in the community; compared with wearing surgical masks, N95/P2 respirators probably make little to no difference in confirmed flu (5 studies; 8407 people) and may make little to no difference in flu-like illness (5 studies; 8407 people) or respiratory illness (3 studies; 7799 people), with discomfort mentioned. For hand hygiene, following a hand hygiene programme may reduce respiratory or flu-like illness or confirmed flu compared with no programme (19 studies; 71,210 people), although the reduction was not statistically confirmed when ILI and lab-confirmed ILI were analysed separately; few studies measured unwanted effects, with skin irritation from sanitiser mentioned. Our confidence in these results is generally low to moderate for subjective outcomes such as respiratory illness, but moderate for more precise laboratory-confirmed infection outcomes related to masks and N95/P2 respirators; results may change with more evidence, and adherence to mask-wearing and hand hygiene was relatively low, which may have affected study outcomes.",1111,acute respiratory infections (ARIs); SARS-CoV-2; H1N1pdm09 virus; severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS); N95/P2 respirators; laboratory-confirmed influenza; influenza-like illness (ILI); physical interventions; antiviral drugs; viral epidemics,What can be deduced about the effectiveness of physical interventions such as masks in different settings from the studyÃ¢ÂÂs findings?,What criteria can be used to evaluate the reliability of the study's conclusions about the use of hand hygiene?,Select all of the following that are fruits,What are the implications of the studyÃ¢ÂÂs findings for the future design of respiratory virus prevention trials?,How could the limited findings on harms associated with interventions impact public health policies?,Masks show consistent effectiveness across all settings.; Effectiveness of masks is inconsistent across different settings.; Masks are ineffective in low-income settings.,Effectiveness of masks is inconsistent across different settings.,The number of trials and participants involved in the hand hygiene studies.; The consistency of outcomes across different respiratory diseases.; The number of different viruses tested in isolation settings only.,The number of trials and participants involved in the hand hygiene studies.; The consistency of outcomes across different respiratory diseases.,dog; blue; grape,grape,Designing trials with a focus on heterogeneous settings and high adherence to interventions.; Excluding healthcare worker settings to focus on community settings only.; Including a wider range of physical interventions besides masks and hand hygiene.,Designing trials with a focus on heterogeneous settings and high adherence to interventions.; Including a wider range of physical interventions besides masks and hand hygiene.,Policies may proceed cautiously due to potential undisclosed harms.; Limited harm reporting justifies the unrestricted use of interventions.; It necessitates further research to guide evidence-based policy decisions.,Policies may proceed cautiously due to potential undisclosed harms.; It necessitates further research to guide evidence-based policy decisions.
62aa4399fa1aadf5ab91fff8,interactive_4,L-ornithine L-aspartate for people with chronic liver disease and hepatic encephalopathy (poor brain functioning),"Hepatic encephalopathy is a common complication of cirrhosis and has high associated morbidity and mortality. The condition is classified as overt if it is clinically apparent or minimal if only evident though psychometric testing. The exact pathogenesis of this syndrome is unknown although ammonia is thought to play a key role. L-ornithine L-aspartate has ammonia-lowering properties and may, therefore, benefit people with cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy.
To evaluate the beneficial and harmful effects of L-ornithine L-aspartate versus placebo, no intervention, or other active interventions in people with cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy.
We undertook electronic searches of The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS and Science Citation Index Expanded to December 2017 and manual searches of meetings and conference proceedings; checks of bibliographies; and corresponded with investigators and pharmaceutical companies.
We included randomised clinical trials, irrespective of publication status, language, or blinding. We included participants with cirrhosis who had minimal or overt hepatic encephalopathy or who were at risk for developing hepatic encephalopathy. We compared: L-ornithine L-aspartate versus placebo or no intervention; and L-ornithine L-aspartate versus other active agents such as non-absorbable disaccharides, antibiotics, probiotics, or branched-chain amino acids.
Two review authors, working independently, retrieved data from published reports and correspondence with investigators and pharmaceutical companies. The primary outcomes were mortality, hepatic encephalopathy, and serious adverse events. We undertook meta-analyses and presented the results as risk ratios (RR) and mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed bias control using the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group domains; we evaluated the risk of publication bias and other small trial effects in regression analyses; conducted subgroup and sensitivity analyses; and performed Trial Sequential Analyses. We determined the quality of the evidence using GRADE.
We identified 36 randomised clinical trials, involving at least 2377 registered participants, which fulfilled our inclusion criteria including 10 unpublished randomised clinical trials. However, we were only able to access outcome data from 29 trials involving 1891 participants. Five of the included trials assessed prevention, while 31 trials assessed treatment. Five trials were at low risk of bias in the overall assessment of mortality; one trial was at low risk of bias in the assessment of the remaining outcomes. L-ornithine L-aspartate had a beneficial effect on mortality compared with placebo or no intervention when including all trials (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.72; I2= 0%; 19 trials; 1489 participants; very low quality evidence), but not when the analysis was restricted to the trials at low risk of bias (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.06 to 3.58; 4 trials; 244 participants). It had a beneficial effect on hepatic encephalopathy compared with placebo or no intervention when including all trials (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.83; 22 trials; 1375 participants; I2= 62%; very low quality evidence), but not in the one trial at low risk of bias (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.07; 63 participants). The analysis of serious adverse events showed a potential benefit of L-ornithine L-aspartate when including all randomised clinical trials (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.90; 1 trial; 1489 participants; I2= 0%; very low quality evidence), but not in the one trial at low risk of bias for this outcome (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.15 to 4.65; 63 participants). The Trial Sequential Analyses of mortality, hepatic encephalopathy, and serious adverse events found insufficient evidence to support or refute beneficial effects. Subgroup analyses showed no difference in outcomes in the trials evaluating evaluating the prevention or treatment of either overt or minimal hepatic encephalopathy or trials evaluating oral versus intravenous administration We were unable to undertake a meta-analysis of the three trials involving 288 participants evaluating health-related quality of life. Overall, we found no difference between L-ornithine L-aspartate and placebo or no intervention in non-serious adverse events (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.77; 14 trials; 1076 participants; I2= 40%). In comparison with lactulose, L-ornithine L-aspartate had no effect on mortality (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.11 to 4.17; 4 trials; 175 participants; I2= 0%); hepatic encephalopathy (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.57); serious adverse events (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.22 to 2.11); or non-serious adverse events (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.18). In comparison with probiotics, L-ornithine L-aspartate had no effect on mortality (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.11 to 9.51); serious adverse events (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.23 to 4.88); or changes in blood ammonia concentrations from baseline (RR -2.30 95% CI -6.08 to 1.48), but it had a possible beneficial effect on hepatic encephalopathy (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.90). Finally, in comparison with rifaximin, L-ornithine L-aspartate had no effect on mortality (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.03; 2 trials; 105 participants); hepatic encephalopathy (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.96); serious adverse events (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.42), or non-serious adverse events (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.42).
The results of this review suggest a possible beneficial effect of L-ornithine L-aspartate on mortality, hepatic encephalopathy, and serious adverse events in comparisons with placebo or no-intervention, but, because the quality of the evidence is very low, we are very uncertain about these findings. There was very low quality evidence of a possible beneficial effect of L-ornithine L-aspartate on hepatic encephalopathy, when compared with probiotics, but no other benefits were demonstrated in comparison with other active agents. Additional access to data from completed, but unpublished trials, and new randomised placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trials are needed.","Cirrhosis is a chronic disorder of the liver. People with this condition commonly develop hepatic encephalopathy, a complication that results in poor brain functioning. Some people with cirrhosis develop obvious clinical features of disturbed brain functioning, such as difficulties with speech, balance and daily functioning; they are said to have overt hepatic encephalopathy; the changes may be short-lived, may recur, or may persist for long periods. Other people with cirrhosis may show no obvious clinical changes but some aspects of their brain function, such as attention and the ability to perform complex tasks are found to be impaired when tested; they are said to have minimal hepatic encephalopathy. The reason why people develop hepatic encephalopathy is complex, but the accumulation in the blood of toxins from the gut, particularly of a compound called ammonia, plays a key role. L-ornithine L-aspartate lowers blood ammonia levels and so may have beneficial effects in people with hepatic encephalopathy or help stop them developing it.
We investigated the use of L-ornithine L-aspartate given either by mouth (oral) or into a vein in an fluid drip (intravenous) for the prevention and treatment of hepatic encephalopathy by reviewing clinical trials in which people with cirrhosis were randomly allocated to treatment with L-ornithine L-aspartate, to an inactive dummy (called placebo), to no treatment, or to another medicine for this condition such as lactulose, probiotics and rifaximin. We included participants with cirrhosis who had overt or minimal hepatic encephalopathy or who were at risk for developing this complication.
December 2017.
Six of the 36 randomised clinical trials we included received no funding or any other support from pharmaceutical companies. Seventeen trials received financial support from pharmaceutical companies and a further three received L-ornithine L-aspartate or inactive placebo free of charge; there was no information on funding in the remaining 10 trials.
We included 33 randomised clinical trials comparing L-ornithine L-aspartate with inactive placebo or no intervention and six randomised clinical trials comparing L-ornithine L-aspartate with other anti-encephalopathy treatments; some trials included more than one comparison. Five of the included trials tested L-ornithine L-aspartate for the prevention of hepatic encephalopathy while 30 trials tested its use as treatment for people with acute, chronic, or minimal hepatic encephalopathy. The length of treatment varied from three to 35 days in the trials testing the intravenous preparation (average eight days) and from seven to 180 days in those testing the oral preparation (average 30 days).
The evidence we found was very weak, and so we are not confident that L-ornithine L-aspartate is of use for preventing or treating hepatic encephalopathy in people with cirrhosis. Many studies were unpublished and so had not been carefully vetted, and many of the published trials received support from the pharmaceutical industry which introduces an element of bias. Accordingly, more information is needed before the value of L-ornithine L-aspartate for preventing and treating hepatic encephalopathy can be determined.",1094,Hepatic encephalopathy; cirrhosis; L-ornithine L-aspartate; ammonia-lowering properties; serious adverse events; non-absorbable disaccharides; probiotics; branched-chain amino acids; health-related quality of life; lactulose,How might the studyÃ¢ÂÂs conclusion about the effect of L-ornithine L-aspartate on mortality be critiqued?,Evaluate the potential impact of publication bias on the studyÃ¢ÂÂs results regarding serious adverse events.,Select the items that are animals,How might the trial design be improved to ensure more reliable outcomes in future studies on L-ornithine L-aspartate for hepatic encephalopathy?,What could be deduced about the weight of evidence from trials that were funded by pharmaceutical companies compared to those that were not?,"The conclusion may be overstated due to the very low quality of evidence.; The sample size was too large, creating unnecessary complexity.; The variations in treatment duration could result in inconsistencies.",The conclusion may be overstated due to the very low quality of evidence.; The variations in treatment duration could result in inconsistencies.,Publication bias may have led to an underestimation of adverse events.; Publication bias likely had no effect on the analysis of adverse events.; Publication bias would primarily affect the reporting of positive outcomes.,Publication bias may have led to an underestimation of adverse events.; Publication bias would primarily affect the reporting of positive outcomes.,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,Incorporate a larger number of double-blind trials to reduce bias.; Limit studies to a single administration method to simplify results.; Ensure all funding sources are disclosed to reduce potential bias.,Incorporate a larger number of double-blind trials to reduce bias.; Ensure all funding sources are disclosed to reduce potential bias.,"There might be an increased likelihood of positive outcomes in funded trials.; Funded trials are likely to have fewer participants, affecting outcomes.; Results from funded trials need cautious interpretation due to potential bias.",There might be an increased likelihood of positive outcomes in funded trials.; Results from funded trials need cautious interpretation due to potential bias.
62aa4399fa1aadf5ab91fff8,finetuned_5,Self-management interventions including action plans for patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD),"Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) self-management interventions should be structured but personalised and often multi-component, with the goal of motivating, engaging, and supporting patients to adapt their behaviour and develop skills to better manage the disease. Exacerbation action plans are considered a key component of COPD self-management, but studies assessing these interventions have shown contradictory results. This review compared the effectiveness of COPD self-management interventions that include action plans for acute exacerbations with usual care. We evaluated the efficacy of COPD-specific self-management interventions that include an action plan for exacerbations compared with usual care in terms of health-related quality of life, respiratory-related hospital admissions, and other health outcomes. We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials, trials registries, and reference lists of included studies up to May 2016. We included randomised controlled trials published since 1995 that evaluated a self-management intervention for people with COPD. Eligible interventions included a written action plan for exacerbations and an iterative process between participants and healthcare providers in which feedback was provided. We excluded pulmonary rehabilitation programmes and group exercise classes to avoid overlap. Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data, resolving disagreements through consensus or with a third author. When appropriate, results were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. Primary outcomes were health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and the number of respiratory-related hospital admissions. We included 22 studies involving 3,854 participants with COPD. Follow-up ranged from two to 24 months, and intervention content varied widely. Over 12 months, self-management interventions with action plans showed a statistically significant beneficial effect on HRQoL, measured using the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire, with a mean difference of -2.69 points compared with usual care. Participants receiving self-management interventions were also at lower risk of at least one respiratory-related hospital admission (OR 0.69). The number needed to treat to prevent one respiratory-related admission over one year ranged from 12 to 17, depending on baseline risk. There was no statistically significant difference in all-cause hospital admission risk, number of hospitalisation days, emergency department visits, general practitioner visits, dyspnoea scores, number of COPD exacerbations, or all-cause mortality. Exploratory analysis showed a small but significantly higher respiratory-related mortality rate in the self-management group. Subgroup analyses showed that including a smoking cessation programme produced greater improvements in HRQoL than interventions without one. Other factors, such as the number of behavioural change techniques, intervention duration, and medication adaptation within action plans, did not significantly influence HRQoL. No variables were identified to explain differences in respiratory-related hospital admissions. Self-management interventions that include a COPD exacerbation action plan are associated with improved HRQoL and reduced respiratory-related hospital admissions. No excess all-cause mortality was observed, but there may be a small increase in respiratory-related mortality. Future studies should ensure that action plans are used only as part of interventions meeting the most up-to-date COPD self-management criteria and should provide clearer descriptions of intervention components to support further subgroup analyses. Action plans should account for comorbidities to increase safety, and future COPD self-management trials should involve Data and Safety Monitoring Boards.","We looked at the evidence on the effects of self-management interventions that include action plans for when COPD symptoms get worse, focusing on health-related quality of life and hospital admissions related to lung disease. People with COPD experience symptoms that worsen over time, leading to reduced well-being. Self-management interventions teach individuals what to do in different situations, including when symptoms worsen, helping them build skills and adopt behaviors that support managing their disease. Action plans outline specific steps to take when symptoms escalate. The effectiveness of these action plans has not been completely clear, even though they are now a common and central component of COPD management. We searched studies up to May 2016 and included 22 randomized trials with 3,854 participants. All studies compared self-management interventions that included an action plan to usual care, with follow-up periods ranging from two to 24 months. Self-management interventions that included an action plan improved health-related quality of life compared with usual care. They also reduced the number of people who had at least one hospital admission related to lung disease. However, there was a small but significant increase in respiratory-related deaths in the self-management group. The studies varied in the content of self-management programs, action plans, and the types of participants included. Although we could not determine which specific components were most effective, including a smoking cessation program appeared to further improve health-related quality of life.",1072,COPD self-management interventions; exacerbation action plans; health-related quality of life; respiratory-related hospital admissions; St. Georgeâs Respiratory Questionnaire; dyspnoea scores; all-cause mortality; smoking cessation programme; medication adaptation; comorbidities,"Based on study outcomes, which strategies best evaluate the benefits of action plans for exacerbations?",What was the main goal of including action plans in COPD self-management interventions?,Select all of the following that are colors,What was the effect of self-management interventions on respiratory-related hospital admissions?,How did the self-management interventions affect respiratory-related mortality?,Monitoring respiratory-related hospital admissions.; Assessing emergency department visits.; Evaluating overall well-being.,Monitoring respiratory-related hospital admissions.,To motivate and support patients; To cure COPD permanently; To increase the number of hospital visits,To motivate and support patients,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,A reduction in hospital admissions; An increase in hospital admissions; No change in hospital admissions,A reduction in hospital admissions,There was a small increase in respiratory-related mortality; There was a large decrease in mortality; Mortality was unaffected,There was a small increase in respiratory-related mortality
62aa4399fa1aadf5ab91fff8,finetuned_6,Long-term treatment for people with persistent depression,"Persistent depressive disorder (PDD) is defined as a depressive disorder with a minimum illness duration of two years, including four diagnostic subgroups (dysthymia, chronic major depression, recurrent major depression with incomplete remission between episodes, and double depression), and persistent forms of depression represent a substantial proportion of depressive disorders, with a lifetime prevalence ranging from 3% to 6% in the Western world; growing evidence indicates that PDD responds well to several acute interventions, such as combined psychological and pharmacological treatments, yet given the high rates of relapse and recurrences of depression following response to acute treatment, long-term continuation and maintenance therapy are of great importance, and to date there has been no evidence synthesis available on continuation and maintenance treatments of PDDs. The aim of this review was to assess the effects of pharmacological and psychological (either alone or combined) continuation and maintenance treatments for persistent depressive disorder, in comparison with each other, placebo (drug/attention placebo/non-specific treatment control), and treatment as usual (TAU), with continuation treatments defined as treatments given to currently remitted people (remission is defined as depressive symptoms dropping below case level) or to people who previously responded to an antidepressant treatment, and maintenance therapy given during recovery (defined as remission lasting longer than six months). We searched Ovid MEDLINE (1950- ), Embase (1974- ), PsycINFO (1967- ) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to 28 September 2018, with an earlier search of these databases also conducted via the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trial Register (CCMD-CTR) to 11 December 2015; in addition we searched grey literature resources, ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP to 28 September 2018, screened reference lists of included studies, and contacted the first author of included studies. We included randomized (RCTs) and non-randomized controlled trials (NRCTs) in adults with formally diagnosed PDD, receiving pharmacological, psychological, or combined continuation and maintenance interventions. Two review authors independently selected studies and extracted and analyzed data; the primary efficacy outcome was relapse/recurrence rate of depression, and the primary acceptance outcome was dropout due to any reason other than relapse/recurrence; we performed random-effects meta-analyses using risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We included 10 studies (seven RCTs, three NRCTs) involving 840 participants, with five studies investigating continuation treatments and five investigating maintenance treatments; overall, the included studies were at low-to-moderate risk of bias, with the most common source of risk of bias in NRCTs being selection of reported results, and in RCTs non-blinding of outcome assessment and other bias (especially conflict of interest due to pharmaceutical sponsoring). The most common comparison was antidepressant medication versus tablet placebo (five studies), and participants taking antidepressant medication were probably less likely to relapse or to experience a recurrent episode compared to participants in the placebo group at the end of the intervention (13.9% versus 33.8%, RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.79; participants = 383; studies = 4;  I²  = 54%, moderate quality evidence); overall dropout rates may be similar between participants in the medication and placebo group (23.0% versus 25.5%, RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.39 to 2.11; RCTs = 4; participants = 386;  I²  = 64%, low quality evidence), although sensitivity analyses showed that the primary outcome (rate of relapse/recurrence) showed no evidence of a difference between groups when only including studies with low risk of bias. None of the studies compared pharmacological or psychological treatments versus TAU. One study compared psychological therapies versus attention placebo/non-specific control, and one study compared psychotherapy with medication; the results of the studies including psychotherapy might indicate that continued or maintained psychotherapy could be a useful intervention compared to no treatment or antidepressant medication, but the body of evidence for these comparisons was too small and uncertain to draw high quality conclusions. Three studies compared combined psychological and pharmacological therapies with pharmacological therapies alone, and one study compared combined psychological and pharmacological therapies with psychotherapeutic therapies alone; however, the evidence was too small and uncertain to draw any high quality conclusions. Two studies reported data on the direct comparison of two antidepressants, but again the evidence was too small and uncertain to draw conclusions. Currently, it is uncertain whether continued or maintained pharmacotherapy (or both) with the reviewed antidepressant agents is a robust treatment for preventing relapse and recurrence in people with PDD due to moderate or high risk of bias as well as clinical heterogeneity in the analyzed studies; for all other comparisons, the body of evidence was too small to draw any final conclusions, although continued or maintained psychotherapy might be effective compared to no treatment. There is a need for more high quality trials of psychological interventions, and further studies should address health-related quality of life and adverse events more precisely, as well as assessing follow-up data.","Depressive disorders that persist for at least two years cause considerable problems; even after successful treatment, they frequently recur, and common treatments are antidepressant medicines and psychological treatments (talking therapies), or a combination of both, with long-term treatments intended to prevent the recurrence of depressive symptoms. People with persisting depression (longer than two years), friends, families, and carers, as well as general practitioners, psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, psychological therapists, and pharmacists, will be interested in this review. In adults with persistent depression who improved with acute (short-term) treatment, the review aimed to determine whether receiving continued antidepressant medicine, psychological treatment, or a combination of both is more effective in preventing recurrence of depression compared to placebo (a pretended treatment) or care as usual; whether receiving continued antidepressant medicine, psychological treatment, or a combination of both is equally accepted as receiving placebo or usual care; and whether one treatment is more effective or more accepted than another. We searched medical databases and other sources to find all relevant studies completed up to September 2018, and the studies had to compare antidepressant treatment, psychological treatment, or a combination of both, with each other, with placebo, or with care as usual for preventing recurrence of depression in adults diagnosed with persistent depression; we included 10 studies involving 840 participants. Five studies compared antidepressant medicine with placebo; one study compared psychological therapies versus attention placebo/non-specific control; one study compared psychotherapy with medication; three studies compared combined psychological and pharmacological therapies with pharmacological therapies alone; one study compared combined psychological and pharmacological therapies with psychotherapeutic therapies alone; and two studies compared two different antidepressants with each other. Overall, the included studies were at low-to-moderate risk of bias. According to GRADE, there was moderate quality evidence that participants taking medication treatment probably had less relapses/recurrences and may have lower dropouts than those taking placebo; the risk of depression returning in participants receiving a placebo (instead of antidepressant medicine) was 34%, whereas participants who remained on antidepressant medicines had a lower risk for recurrence of 13%, with continued treatment lasting between four months and two years. Antidepressants were as well accepted as placebo; however, as most of the included studies showed risk of bias and there were some inconsistent results between the different studies, it cannot be concluded with certainty whether continued or maintained pharmacotherapy (or both) is a convincing treatment for people with PDD. Additionally, as studies on the long-term effects of medication are lacking, recommendations on the necessary duration of medication treatment cannot be drawn. The benefits of psychological therapies or combined treatment remained unclear due to the small number of studies. This review cannot provide clear, certain evidence regarding whether continued antidepressant medication (compared to placebo tablet) reduces the risk of depression recurring in adults with persistent depression; however, only a few studies have been done, and further studies should especially address psychological and combined long-term treatments.",1116,Persistent depressive disorder; acute interventions; remission; continuation and maintenance therapy; psychotherapy,What might be the implications of the study's findings for the long-term management of persistent depressive disorder (PDD)?,What is the primary focus of the study?,Select all of the following that are fruits,Which treatments were compared in the study?,How are long-term treatments intended to benefit patients with persistent depression?,Continued antidepressant medication offers a definitive solution to prevent recurrence.; Psychotherapy could potentially be more effective but requires further research.; There is uncertainty regarding the efficacy of combined treatments due to limited data.,Psychotherapy could potentially be more effective but requires further research.; There is uncertainty regarding the efficacy of combined treatments due to limited data.,Assessing continuation and maintenance treatments for persistent depression; Investigating new antidepressant medications; Studying short-term interventions for depression,Assessing continuation and maintenance treatments for persistent depression,dog; blue; grape,grape,Antidepressant medications versus placebo; Psychological therapies versus attention placebo; Lifestyle interventions versus exercise,Antidepressant medications versus placebo; Psychological therapies versus attention placebo,Preventing recurrence of depressive symptoms; Eliminating depressive symptoms completely; Providing immediate relief from symptoms,Preventing recurrence of depressive symptoms
62aa4399fa1aadf5ab91fff8,finetuned_6,Is liraglutide an effective weight-loss treatment for adults living with obesity and does it cause unwanted effects?,"To assess the effects of liraglutide, a GLP-1RA, for adults living with obesity, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and two trials registries on 17 December 2024. Liraglutide likely increases the proportion of people achieving at least 5% weight loss at medium-term follow-up; this effect is likely to be sustained at longer-term follow-up. Medium- or long-term impact on percentage weight change, MACE, quality of life, and mortality may be limited or uncertain. Liraglutide may lead to an increase in adverse events, including serious adverse events in both the medium and long term, which might further limit the sustainability of the initial effects. The drug manufacturer funded 22 studies, raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest. Further independent and long-term studies are needed to better understand the broader effects of liraglutide in the management of obesity.","Obesity is a long-term condition in which a person has too much body fat. It can increase the risk of health problems like type 2 diabetes, diseases of the heart and blood vessels (cardiovascular disease), and some types of cancer. Obesity levels are increasing worldwide, placing a significant burden on healthcare systems. Managing obesity usually involves lifestyle changes such as eating a healthier diet and being more physically active. However, many people find these changes difficult to maintain, and doctors may prescribe medications to support weight loss. Liraglutide is a type of medication that helps people feel full sooner, and so eat less. It was originally developed to treat type 2 diabetes but has been approved in many countries to help people lose weight. It is given as a daily injection. Some people taking liraglutide experience unwanted effects, such as feeling or being sick, diarrhoea and constipation. Liraglutide is a  GLP-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA). Similar medications include semaglutide and tirzepatide. We wanted to know how well liraglutide works in adults with obesity in the medium term (6 to 24 months) and long term (24 months or more). We examined its effects on weight, unwanted effects, obesity-related health problems, quality of life and risk of death. We did not look at what happens after people stop taking liraglutide. We searched for studies that investigated liraglutide for adults living with obesity. Studies could investigate any dose of liraglutide compared with placebo (sham medication), no treatment, lifestyle changes or another weight-loss medication. We included studies in which people took liraglutide for at least 6 months. We compared and analysed the results and assessed our confidence in the evidence. We found 24 studies with 9937 men and women with obesity, aged between 31 and 64 years. Some people had weight-related conditions like diabetes or liver disease. Most studies compared liraglutide with placebo. They mainly took place in high- and middle-income countries. People who took liraglutide were more likely to lose at least 5% of their body weight than those who took a placebo in the medium (18 studies, 6651 people) and long term (2 studies, 1262 people). However, we are uncertain about liraglutide's effects on people's overall percentage weight change from the beginning of the study to the medium term (16 studies, 6050 people) and there may be little to no difference in percentage weight change in the long term (2 studies, 1262 people). In the medium term, people taking liraglutide might experience more unwanted effects of any kind (16 studies, 8147 people) and more serious unwanted effects (20 studies, 8487 people) than those taking placebo. We are unsure about mild-to-moderate unwanted effects (17 studies, 7440 people) or whether unwanted effects caused people to stop treatment (19 studies, 8628 people). In the long term (2 studies, 2640 participants), liraglutide may increase unwanted effects and people may be more likely to stop treatment because of them. We are unsure about unwanted events overall and mild-to-moderate unwanted effects. Liraglutide probably makes little or no difference to quality of life both in the medium term (6 studies, 3733 people) and in the long term (1 study, 863 people). Liraglutide probably makes little or no difference to major cardiovascular events in the medium term (6 studies, 5762 people). We are unsure about its effects on major cardiovascular events in the long term and on deaths in the medium and long term. We are moderately confident that people taking liraglutide lose more weight than those taking placebo. However, our confidence in the other evidence is limited because of how the studies were conducted and information that was missing. Few studies looked at long-term effects or included different people from different places, so the results may not apply to everyone. The manufacturers of liraglutide were involved in the design, conduct or analysis of 22 of the 24 studies, which limits our confidence in the results.

6680de3494e4607dcf95530d,static_1,Low-carbohydrate diets or balanced-carbohydrate diets: which works better for weight loss and heart disease risks?,"Debates on effective and safe diets for managing obesity in adults are ongoing. Low-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets (also known as 'low-carb diets') continue to be widely promoted, marketed and commercialised as being more effective for weight loss, and healthier, than 'balanced'-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets. To compare the effects of low-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets to weight-reducing diets with balanced ranges of carbohydrates, in relation to changes in weight and cardiovascular risk, in overweight and obese adults without and with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We searched MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase (Ovid), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Web of Science Core Collection (Clarivate Analytics), ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to 25 June 2021, and screened reference lists of included trials and relevant systematic reviews. Language or publication restrictions were not applied. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in adults (18 years+) who were overweight or living with obesity, without or with T2DM, and without or with cardiovascular conditions or risk factors. Trials had to compare low-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets to balanced-carbohydrate (45% to 65% of total energy (TE)) weight-reducing diets, have a weight-reducing phase of 2 weeks or longer and be explicitly implemented for the primary purpose of reducing weight, with or without advice to restrict energy intake. Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts and full?text articles to determine eligibility; and independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias using RoB 2 and assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. We stratified analyses by participants without and with T2DM, and by diets with weight-reducing phases only and those with weight-reducing phases followed by weight-maintenance phases. Primary outcomes were change in body weight (kg) and the number of participants per group with weight loss of at least 5%, assessed at short- (three months to < 12 months) and long-term (? 12 months) follow-up. We included 61 parallel-arm RCTs that randomised 6925 participants to either low-carbohydrate or balanced-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets. All trials were conducted in high-income countries except for one in China. Most participants (n = 5118 randomised) did not have T2DM. Mean baseline weight across trials was 95 kg (range 66 to 132 kg). Participants with T2DM were older (mean 57 years, range 50 to 65) than those without T2DM (mean 45 years, range 22 to 62). Most trials included men and women (42/61; 3/19 men only; 16/19 women only), and people without baseline cardiovascular conditions, risk factors or events (36/61). Mean baseline diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol across trials were within normal ranges. The longest weight-reducing phase of diets was two years in participants without and with T2DM. Evidence from studies with weight-reducing phases followed by weight-maintenance phases was limited. Most trials investigated low-carbohydrate diets (> 50 g to 150 g per day or < 45% of TE; n = 42), followed by very low (? 50 g per day or < 10% of TE; n = 14), and then incremental increases from very low to low (n = 5). The most common diets compared were low-carbohydrate, balanced-fat (20 to 35% of TE) and high-protein (> 20% of TE) treatment diets versus control diets balanced for the three macronutrients (24/61). In most trials (45/61) the energy prescription or approach used to restrict energy intake was similar in both groups. We assessed the overall risk of bias of outcomes across trials as predominantly high, mostly from bias due to missing outcome data. Using GRADE, we assessed the certainty of evidence as moderate to very low across outcomes. Participants without and with T2DM lost weight when following weight-reducing phases of both diets at the short (range: 12.2 to 0.33 kg) and long term (range: 13.1 to 1.7 kg). In overweight and obese participants without T2DM: low-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets compared to balanced-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets (weight-reducing phases only) probably result in little to no difference in change in body weight over three to 8.5 months (mean difference (MD) ?1.07 kg, (95% confidence interval (CI) ?1.55 to ?0.59, I2 = 51%, 3286 participants, 37 RCTs, moderate-certainty evidence) and over one to two years (MD ?0.93 kg, 95% CI ?1.81 to ?0.04, I2 = 40%, 1805 participants, 14 RCTs, moderate-certainty evidence); as well as change in DBP and LDL cholesterol over one to two years. The evidence is very uncertain about whether there is a difference in the number of participants per group with weight loss of at least 5% at one year (risk ratio (RR) 1.11, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.31, I2 = 17%, 137 participants, 2 RCTs, very low-certainty evidence). In overweight and obese participants with T2DM: low-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets compared to balanced-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets (weight-reducing phases only) probably result in little to no difference in change in body weight over three to six months (MD ?1.26 kg, 95% CI ?2.44 to ?0.09, I2 = 47%, 1114 participants, 14 RCTs, moderate-certainty evidence) and over one to two years (MD ?0.33 kg, 95% CI ?2.13 to 1.46, I2 = 10%, 813 participants, 7 RCTs, moderate-certainty evidence); as well in change in DBP, HbA1c and LDL cholesterol over 1 to 2 years. The evidence is very uncertain about whether there is a difference in the number of participants per group with weight loss of at least 5% at one to two years (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.20, I2 = 0%, 106 participants, 2 RCTs, very low-certainty evidence). Evidence on participant-reported adverse effects was limited, and we could not draw any conclusions about these. There is probably little to no difference in weight reduction and changes in cardiovascular risk factors up to two years' follow-up, when overweight and obese participants without and with T2DM are randomised to either low-carbohydrate or balanced-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets.","What are low-carbohydrate and balanced-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets? People spend lots of money on trying to lose weight using diets, products, foods and books, and continue to debate about which diets are effective and safe. So, examining the scientific evidence behind claims made is important. Low-carbohydrate diets are a broad category of weight-reducing diets that manipulate and restrict carbohydrates, protein and fat in diets. There are no consistent, widely-accepted definitions of these diets and different descriptions are used (such as, 'low-carbohydrate, high-protein, 'low-carbohydrate, high-fat', or very low-carbohydrate). Low-carbohydrate diets are implemented in different ways, but they restrict grains, cereals and legumes, and other carbohydrate-containing foods; such as dairy, most fruit and certain vegetables. These foods are then typically replaced with foods higher in fat and protein; such as meats, eggs, cheese, butter, cream, oils. Some low-carbohydrate diets recommend eating as desired, while others recommend restricting the amount of energy eaten. Balanced-carbohydrate diets contain more moderate amounts of carbohydrates, protein and fats, in line with current healthy eating advice from health authorities. When used for weight reduction, balanced diets recommend restricting the amount of energy eaten by guiding people to reduce their portion sizes and choose healthier foods (e.g. lean instead of fatty meat). Low-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets are widely promoted, marketed and commercialised as being more effective for weight loss, and healthier, than 'balanced'-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets. What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out if low-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets were better for weight loss and heart disease risk factors than balanced-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets in adults who were overweight or living with obesity. We wanted to find this out for people with and without type 2 diabetes. What did we do? We searched six electronic databases and trial registries for all trials* that compared low-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets with balanced-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets in adults who were overweight or living with obesity. The trials had to last for at least three months. We compared and summarised the results of the trials and rated our confidence in the combined evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. *A trial is a type of study in which participants are assigned randomly to two or more treatment groups. This is the best way to ensure similar groups of participants. What did we find? We found 61 trials involving 6925 people who were overweight or living with obesity. The biggest trial was in 419 people and the smallest was in 20 people. All except one of the trials were conducted in high-income countries worldwide, and nearly half were undertaken in the USA (26). Most trials (36) were undertaken in people who did not have heart disease or risk factors. Most people (5118 people) did not have type 2 diabetes. The average starting weight of people across the trials was 95 kg. Most studies (37) lasted for six months or less; and the longest studies (6) lasted for two years. Main results Low-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets probably result in little to no difference in weight loss over the short term (trials lasting 3 to 8.5 months) and long term (trials lasting one to two years) compared to balanced-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets, in people with and without type 2 diabetes. In the short term, the average difference in weight loss was about 1 kg and in the long term, the average difference was less than 1 kg. People lost weight on both diets in some trials. The amount of weight lost on average varied greatly with both diets across the trials from less than 1 kg in some trials and up to about 12 kg in others in the short term and long term. Similarly, low-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets probably result in little to no difference in diastolic blood pressure, glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and LDL cholesterol (unhealthy cholesterol) for up to two years. We could not draw any conclusions about unwanted effects reported by participants because very few trials reported these. What are the limitations of the evidence? We are moderately confident in the evidence. Our confidence was lowered mainly because of concerns about how some the trials were conducted, which included that many trials did not report all their results.

6680de3494e4607dcf95530d,static_2,Bezafibrate for primary biliary cirrhosis,"Treatment of primary biliary cirrhosis is complicated, and although some studies suggest that bezafibrate, alone or with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), may be effective, no systematic review had summarised the evidence. This review assessed the beneficial and harmful effects of bezafibrate in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. Searches of multiple databases including the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP were conducted up to late 2011, along with Chinese databases up to January 2011, and manufacturers and authors were contacted. All randomised clinical trials comparing bezafibrate at any dose or regimen with placebo, no intervention, or another drug were included, allowing concomitant interventions if equally applied to all groups. Two authors extracted data, and analyses used risk ratios or risk differences for dichotomous data, mean differences for continuous data, and trial sequential analysis to assess random errors. Six trials with 151 Japanese patients were included, all at high risk of bias; four trials compared bezafibrate plus UDCA with no intervention plus UDCA, and two compared bezafibrate with UDCA. No patients died or developed liver-related complications. Bezafibrate had no significant effect on adverse events compared with no intervention (5/32 vs 0/28; RR 5.40, 95% CI 0.69 to 42.32) or UDCA (2/32 vs 0/37; RR 6.19, 95% CI 0.31 to 122.05). Bezafibrate significantly reduced serum alkaline phosphatase activity compared with no intervention (MD -186.04 U/L, 95% CI -249.03 to -123.04) and compared with UDCA (MD -162.90 U/L, 95% CI -199.68 to -126.12), with results supported by trial sequential analyses. Compared with no intervention, bezafibrate also significantly reduced plasma immunoglobulin M (MD -164.00 mg/dl, 95% CI -259.47 to -68.53) and serum bilirubin (MD -0.19 mg/dl, 95% CI -0.38 to -0.00), though these two findings were not supported by trial sequential analyses. Bezafibrate showed no significant effect on serum gamma-glutamyltransferase or alanine aminotransferase compared with no intervention. Compared with UDCA, bezafibrate showed no significant effects on these enzymes or immunoglobulin M in random-effects models, but fixed-effect models suggested significant decreases in all three markers. One patient discontinued bezafibrate due to an adverse event. Overall, bezafibrate showed no effect on mortality, liver-related morbidity, adverse events, or pruritus compared with no intervention or UDCA, and none of the trials assessed quality of life or fatigue. Although bezafibrate may improve some liver biochemical measures, these findings may reflect bias or random error. More rigorous randomised clinical trials are needed.","Primary biliary cirrhosis is a chronic disease of the liver that is characterised by progressive inflammation and destruction of the liver tissue, eventually progressing to liver cirrhosis and the need for liver transplantation. Primary biliary cirrhosis primarily affects middle-aged women. Bezafibrate is a hypolipidaemic agent used in treatment of hypertriglyceridaemia. There are studies suggesting that bezafibrate, alone or in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid, is effective in treatment of primary biliary cirrhosis. Mechanisms through which bezafibrate improves lipid serum concentration balance and prevents biliary cell damage still need to be fully understood. This review evaluates all data on the benefits and harms of bezafibrate for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis in randomised clinical trials. The findings of this review are based on six randomised clinical trials with 151 Japanese patients. Bezafibrate was compared with no intervention in four trials (with co-intervention of ursodeoxycholic acid in both the bezafibrate and control groups) and with ursodeoxycholic acid in two trials. The primary findings of the review are that bezafibrate has no statistically significant effects on mortality, liver-related morbidity, adverse events, and quality of life of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. A possible positive intervention effect of bezafibrate versus no intervention on liver biochemistry measures can be real but could also be due to systematic errors or random errors. The benefits and harms of bezafibrate for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis need further assessment in randomised clinical trials comparing bezafibrate with placebo. Such trials ought to be conducted with impeccable methodology to reduce the risks of random errors and sufficiently large patient groups to reduce the risks of random errors.",1096,bezafibrate; primary biliary cirrhosis; ursodeoxycholic acid; liver-related complications; plasma immunoglobulin M; serum bilirubin; serum gamma-glutamyltransferase; alanine aminotransferase; liver biochemical measures; pruritus,What are the primary motivations for conducting a systematic review on bezafibrate in primary biliary cirrhosis?,How could the findings of this review affect future research directions in liver treatment?,Select all of the following that are colors,How should the potential for systematic or random errors influence the interpretation of bezafibrateÃ¢ÂÂs effects?,What did the trials compare bezafibrate with?,To consolidate existing evidence from scattered studies; To develop new treatment protocols; To address the lack of definitive conclusions regarding its efficacy,To consolidate existing evidence from scattered studies; To address the lack of definitive conclusions regarding its efficacy,By discouraging further trials on bezafibrate; By highlighting the need for rigorously conducted trials; By confirming the current clinical guidelines,By highlighting the need for rigorously conducted trials,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,It should be considered as a major limitation in assessing benefits; It validates the significance of the findings; It suggests that bezafibrate's benefits are entirely due to error,It should be considered as a major limitation in assessing benefits,No intervention and ursodeoxycholic acid; Placebo and vitamins; Dietary changes only,No intervention and ursodeoxycholic acid
6680de3494e4607dcf95530d,static_2,Does taxation of unprocessed sugar or foods with added sugar reduce their consumption and prevent obesity or other adverse health outcomes?,"Global prevalence of overweight and obesity are alarming. For tackling this public health problem, preventive public health and policy actions are urgently needed. Some countries implemented food taxes in the past and some were subsequently abolished. Some countries, such as Norway, Hungary, Denmark, Bermuda, Dominica, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and the Navajo Nation (USA), specifically implemented taxes on unprocessed sugar and sugar-added foods. These taxes on unprocessed sugar and sugar-added foods are fiscal policy interventions, implemented to decrease their consumption and in turn reduce adverse health-related, economic and social effects associated with these food products. To assess the effects of taxation of unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods in the general population on the consumption of unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods, the prevalence and incidence of overweight and obesity, and the prevalence and incidence of other diet-related health outcomes. We searched CENTRAL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, Embase and 15 other databases and trials registers on 12 September 2019. We handsearched the reference list of all records of included studies, searched websites of international organisations and institutions, and contacted review advisory group members to identify planned, ongoing or unpublished studies. We included studies with the following populations: children (0 to 17 years) and adults (18 years or older) from any country and setting. Exclusion applied to studies with specific subgroups, such as people with any disease who were overweight or obese as a side-effect of the disease. The review included studies with taxes on or artificial increases of selling prices for unprocessed sugar or food products that contain added sugar (e.g. sweets, ice cream, confectionery, and bakery products), or both, as intervention, regardless of the taxation level or price increase. In line with Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) criteria, we included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-randomised controlled trials (cRCTs), non-randomised controlled trials (nRCTs), controlled before-after (CBA) studies, and interrupted time series (ITS) studies. We included controlled studies with more than one intervention or control site and ITS studies with a clearly defined intervention time and at least three data points before and three after the intervention. Our primary outcomes were consumption of unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods, energy intake, overweight, and obesity. Our secondary outcomes were substitution and diet, expenditure, demand, and other health outcomes. Two review authors independently screened all eligible records for inclusion, assessed the risk of bias, and performed data extraction.Two review authors independently assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We retrieved a total of 24,454 records. After deduplicating records, 18,767 records remained for title and abstract screening. Of 11 potentially relevant studies, we included one ITS study with 40,210 household-level observations from the Hungarian Household Budget and Living Conditions Survey. The baseline ranged from January 2008 to August 2011, the intervention was implemented on September 2011, and follow-up was until December 2012 (16 months). The intervention was a tax - the so-called 'Hungarian public health product tax' - on sugar-added foods, including selected foods exceeding a specific sugar threshold value. The intervention includes co-interventions: the taxation of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) and of foods high in salt or caffeine. The study provides evidence on the effect of taxing foods exceeding a specific sugar threshold value on the consumption of sugar-added foods. After implementation of the Hungarian public health product tax, the mean consumption of taxed sugar-added foods (measured in units of kg) decreased by 4.0% (standardised mean difference (SMD) ?0.040, 95% confidence interval (CI) ?0.07 to ?0.01; very low-certainty evidence). The study was at low risk of bias in terms of performance bias, detection bias and reporting bias, with the shape of effect pre-specified and the intervention unlikely to have any effect on data collection. The study was at unclear risk of attrition bias and at high risk in terms of other bias and the independence of the intervention. We rated the certainty of the evidence as very low for the primary and secondary outcomes. The Hungarian public health product tax included a tax on sugar-added foods but did not include a tax on unprocessed sugar. We did not find eligible studies reporting on the taxation of unprocessed sugar. No studies reported on the primary outcomes of consumption of unprocessed sugar, energy intake, overweight, and obesity. No studies reported on the secondary outcomes of substitution and diet, demand, and other health outcomes. No studies reported on differential effects across population subgroups. We could not perform meta-analyses or pool study results. There was very limited evidence and the certainty of the evidence was very low. Despite the reported reduction in consumption of taxed sugar-added foods, we are uncertain whether taxing unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods has an effect on reducing their consumption and preventing obesity or other adverse health outcomes. Further robustly conducted studies are required to draw concrete conclusions on the effectiveness of taxing unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods for reducing their consumption and preventing obesity or other adverse health outcomes.","As outlined by the World Health Organization, 'globesity' (the rise in overweight and obesity globally) is a major world challenge. A sugar-rich diet, especially when combined with physical inactivity, may cause overweight and obesity, and other harmful health outcomes. There are direct costs to healthcare services of people being overweight or obese, such as preventing and treating health problems that this causes. There are also costs to society as a whole when people who are ill through being overweight or obese are unable to work. This review may be of interest to government public health agencies, policy decision-makers, food retailers, and food industries. This review and subsequent updates of this review may change policy and affect a government's motivation to create a tax on unprocessed sugar and foods with added sugar. It also may motivate food industries to reformulate their products to contain lower levels of added sugar. We wanted to know if taxation of unprocessed sugar and foods with added sugar (other than sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs)) reduced their consumption, changed people's energy intake, and reduced overweight and obesity. We also wanted to know if taxation changed people's diet and spending, and had an effect on other diet-related health problems. We searched for ongoing or published studies up to October 2019. Of a total of 24,454 records retrieved, we identified one 'interrupted time series' (ITS) study meeting our eligibility criteria to assess the impact of a tax on sugar-added foods (but not unprocessed sugar). The study used data from the Hungarian Household Budget and Living Conditions Survey, with observations from 40,210 households. Evidence from the study included a 'baseline' (the situation before taxation), ranging from January 2008 to August 2011. The Hungarian public health product tax was implemented on September 2011. The duration of the follow-up period (measuring the effects of taxation) was 16 months. The study was funded by the Scottish Institute for Research in Economics (SIRE) Early Career Engagement Grant. The included study provided very limited evidence that taxing foods with added sugar reduced their consumption by 4%. We are very uncertain about this evidence because the study did not use the strongest methods, looked at other kinds of taxation as well as taxing foods with added sugar, and may not have correctly classified food types. We are uncertain whether taxing foods with added sugar has an effect on reducing their consumption. The included study did not investigate the effects of taxing unprocessed sugar. Further research is needed to assess the effectiveness of taxing unprocessed sugar or foods with added sugar for reducing their consumption and preventing obesity or other adverse health outcomes. Studies should take place in countries that have implemented these taxes and should look at cost-effectiveness as well as the health benefits of taxing unprocessed sugar or foods with added sugar as a public health policy for preventing overweight, obesity or other adverse health outcomes. Countries that have implemented these taxes are Bermuda, Dominica, Hungary, India, Norway, the Navajo Nation (USA), and St. Vincent and Grenadines.",1103,overweight and obesity; preventive public health; fiscal policy interventions; Hungarian public health product tax; sugar-sweetened beverages; very low-certainty evidence; consumption of sugar-added foods; prevalence and incidence; demand and other health outcomes,Evaluate the impact of sugar taxation on public health policy motivation.,What potential effects on food reformulation might result from this study's findings?,Select all of the following that are fruits,Analyze the reasons for including various countries with implemented sugar taxes in the study.,Judge the reliability of the study based on the methods used to assess sugar consumption reduction.,It may motivate policy changes to implement sugar taxes.; It provides conclusive evidence to halt all sugar taxes.; It discourages future research on sugar taxation policies.,It may motivate policy changes to implement sugar taxes.,Industries could reduce added sugar in products.; Industries might eliminate all sugar from products.; Industries will increase sugar content to boost sales.,Industries could reduce added sugar in products.,dog; blue; grape,grape,To provide a comprehensive review of international tax efficacy.; To identify global trends in sugar consumption reduction.; To facilitate the exploration of diverse tax-related health outcomes.,To facilitate the exploration of diverse tax-related health outcomes.,The methods used were robust and reliable.; The study lacked strong methods and classifications.; The reliability was high due to the large sample size.,The study lacked strong methods and classifications.

The most common traumatic injury to the eye is blunt trauma, which accounts for 30% of these visits. Blunt trauma frequently leads to traumatic iridocyclitis, thus causing anterior uveitis. Iridocyclitis frequently causes tearing, photophobia, eye pain, and vision loss. These symptoms are a result of the inflammatory processes and ciliary spasms to iris muscles and sphincter. The inflammatory process is usually managed with topical corticosteroids, while the ciliary spasm is blunted by dilating the pupils with topical mydriatic agents, an adjuvant therapy. However, the effectiveness of mydriatic agents has not been quantified in terms of reduction of ocular pain and visual acuity loss.
To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of topical mydriatics as adjunctive therapy to topical corticosteroids for traumatic iridocyclitis.

We planned to include randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared topical mydriatic agents in conjunction with topical corticosteroid therapy versus topical corticosteroids alone, in participants with traumatic iridocyclitis.
Two review authors (JH, MK) independently screened titles and abstracts, then full-text reports, against eligibility criteria. We planned to have two authors independently extract data from included studies. We resolved differences in opinion by discussion.
There were no eligible RCTs that compared the interventions of interest in people with traumatic iridocyclitis.
We did not find any evidence from RCTs about the efficacy of topical mydriatic agents as an adjunctive therapy with topical corticosteroids for treating traumatic iridocyclitis. In the absence of these types of studies, we cannot draw any firm conclusions. Controlled trials that compare the combined use of topical mydriatic agents and corticosteroid drops against standard corticosteroid drops alone, in people with traumatic iridocyclitis are required. These may provide evidence about the efficacy and risk of topical mydriatic drops as adjuvant therapy for traumatic iridocyclitis.","Hospital emergency departments often treat people with eye injuries. There are two main types of eye injuries: blunt trauma injuries, when an object or force strikes the eye, commonly caused by motor vehicle accidents, sports- or work-related accidents, or fights; and penetrating trauma injuries, when a sharp object or an object traveling at high speed (for example, pellets from air-powered guns) pierces the eye. Blunt trauma is the more common type of injury. People who experience these injuries often develop traumatic iridocyclitis, an inflammation of the iris (the colored part of the eye surrounding the pupil) and the ciliary body (the muscles and tissues around the iris). Traumatic iridocyclitis can develop after both major and minor blunt trauma and can affect both children and adults. Symptoms include eye pain and sensitivity to light. If the inflammation is missed or not treated properly, it can lead to vision loss. The standard treatment for traumatic iridocyclitis is anti-inflammatory eye drops (corticosteroids). Eye drops that widen the pupil (mydriatics) are often added to reduce pain and discomfort and to shorten the duration of symptoms. We aimed to determine whether using mydriatics alongside corticosteroids is more beneficial or causes more unwanted effects than using corticosteroids alone. Specifically, we wanted to know if mydriatics relieve pain and inflammation and improve vision, and whether they cause complications such as chronic pain or serious harm to vision, including blindness. Our team searched the medical literature for randomized controlled trials the most reliable type of study on people of any age with traumatic iridocyclitis that compared mydriatics plus corticosteroids against corticosteroids alone. We found no randomized controlled trials addressing this question. Therefore, we do not know whether adding mydriatics to corticosteroids is helpful or harmful compared with corticosteroids alone. More research is needed, including well-designed trials, to understand the benefits and risks of using mydriatics as an additional treatment for traumatic iridocyclitis.",1053,Topical mydriatic agents; Topical corticosteroids; Traumatic iridocyclitis; Blunt trauma; Anterior uveitis; Ciliary spasms; Photophobia; Inflammatory processes; Adjunctive therapy; Ocular pain,How might the lack of randomized controlled trials affect the implementation of mydriatic agents in clinical practice for traumatic iridocyclitis?,What is the intended benefit of adding mydriatics to corticosteroid treatment for traumatic iridocyclitis?,Select the items that are animals,Describe the condition known as traumatic iridocyclitis.,What standard treatment is used for traumatic iridocyclitis?,"Clinicians may hesitate to use mydriatics due to unclear benefits and risks.; Clinicians can confidently prescribe mydriatics, assuming they're safe.; Clinicians should replace corticosteroids with mydriatics alone.",Clinicians may hesitate to use mydriatics due to unclear benefits and risks.,To relieve pain and improve vision; To reduce allergic reactions; To prevent infection,To relieve pain and improve vision,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,An inflammation of the iris and ciliary body; A breakdown of the retina; A swelling of the cornea,An inflammation of the iris and ciliary body,Anti-inflammatory eye drops (corticosteroids); Antibiotic ointments; Laser eye surgery,Anti-inflammatory eye drops (corticosteroids)
6680de3494e4607dcf95530d,interactive_4,Insulin detemir versus insulin glargine for type 2 diabetes mellitus,"Chronically elevated blood glucose levels are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Many diabetes patients will eventually require insulin treatment to maintain good glycaemic control. There are still uncertainties about the optimal insulin treatment regimens for type 2 diabetes, but the long-acting insulin analogues seem beneficial. Several reviews have compared either insulin detemir or insulin glargine to NPH insulin, but research directly comparing both insulin analogues is limited.
To assess the effects of insulin detemir and insulin glargine compared with each other in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, online registries of ongoing trials and abstract books. Date of last search was January 2011.
All randomised controlled trials comparing insulin detemir with insulin glargine with a duration of 12 weeks or longer were included.
Two authors independently selected the studies and extracted the data. Pooling of studies by means of random-effects meta-analysis was performed.
This review examined four trials lasting 24 to 52 weeks involving 2250 people randomised to either insulin detemir or glargine. Overall, risk of bias of the evaluated studies was high. Insulin glargine was dosed once-daily in the evening. Insulin detemir was initiated once-daily in the evening with the option of an additional dose in the morning in three studies and initiated twice-daily in one study. Of randomised patients 13.6% to 57.2% were injecting insulin detemir twice-daily at the end of trial. Glycaemic control, measured by glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and HbA1c equal to or less than 7% with or without hypoglycaemia, did not differ statistically significantly between treatment groups. The results showed no significant differences in overall, nocturnal and severe hypoglycaemia between treatment groups. Insulin detemir was associated with less weight gain. Treatment with insulin glargine resulted in a lower daily basal insulin dose and a lower number of injection site reactions. There was no significant difference in the variability of FPG or glucose values in 24-hour profiles between treatment groups. It was not possible to draw conclusions on quality of life, costs or mortality. Only one trial reported results on health-related quality of life and showed no significant differences between treatment groups.
Our analyses suggest that there is no clinically relevant difference in efficacy or safety between insulin detemir and insulin glargine for targeting hyperglycaemia. However, to achieve the same glycaemic control insulin detemir was often injected twice-daily in a higher dose but with less weight gain, while insulin glargine was injected once-daily, with somewhat fewer injection site reactions.","The two long-acting insulin analogues (artificial insulins), insulin detemir or insulin glargine differ in their mechanism of attaining protracted action, leading to possible differences in glycaemic control and safety outcomes. Several studies have compared either insulin detemir or insulin glargine to NPH (Neutral Protamin Hagedorn) insulin. Research directly comparing both long-acting insulin analogues is limited.
Our aim was to systematically review the efficacy and safety of insulin detemir and insulin glargine in head-to-head studies in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Four studies investigated a total of 2250 people. Trials lasted between 24 and 52 weeks. Overall, risk of bias of the evaluated studies was high. Our analysis of these intermediate term trials comparing insulin detemir with insulin glargine showed that these two insulins were equally effective in achieving and maintaining glycaemic control (glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)). There were no differences in overall, nocturnal and severe hypoglycaemia when comparing insulin detemir to insulin glargine. Insulin detemir was associated with significantly less weight gain (one study showing a difference of 0.9 kg). Treatment with insulin glargine resulted in a lower daily basal insulin dose and a lower number of injection site reactions (1.8% of patients treated with insulin detemir compared to 0.4% of patients treated with insulin glargine had injection side reactions).
There was no difference in the variability of fasting glucose levels or the variability of glucose values of 24-hour profiles between the two treatment groups.
From the retrieved trials it was not possible to draw conclusions on the effects of these two insulins on quality of life, their costs or on the number of fatalities. Only one trial reported results on health-related quality of life and showed no significant differences between treatment groups.
Our analyses suggest that there is no clinically relevant difference in the efficacy or the safety between the use of insulin detemir and insulin glargine for treating type 2 diabetes mellitus.

6680de3494e4607dcf95530d,interactive_4,Quality improvement strategies for diabetes care: Effects on outcomes for adults living with diabetes,"There is a large body of evidence evaluating quality improvement (QI) programmes to improve care for adults living with diabetes. These programmes are often comprised of multiple QI strategies, which may be implemented in various combinations. Decision-makers planning to implement or evaluate a new QI programme, or both, need reliable evidence on the relative effectiveness of different QI strategies (individually and in combination) for different patient populations. To update existing systematic reviews of diabetes QI programmes and apply novel meta-analytical techniques to estimate the effectiveness of QI strategies (individually and in combination) on diabetes quality of care. We searched databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL) and trials registers (ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP) to 4 June 2019. We conducted a top-up search to 23 September 2021; we screened these search results and 42 studies meeting our eligibility criteria are available in the awaiting classification section. We included randomised trials that assessed a QI programme to improve care in outpatient settings for people living with diabetes. QI programmes needed to evaluate at least one system- or provider-targeted QI strategy alone or in combination with a patient-targeted strategy. - System-targeted: case management (CM); team changes (TC); electronic patient registry (EPR); facilitated relay of clinical information (FR); continuous quality improvement (CQI). - Provider-targeted: audit and feedback (AF); clinician education (CE); clinician reminders (CR); financial incentives (FI). - Patient-targeted: patient education (PE); promotion of self-management (PSM); patient reminders (PR). Patient-targeted QI strategies needed to occur with a minimum of one provider or system-targeted strategy. We dual-screened search results and abstracted data on study design, study population and QI strategies. We assessed the impact of the programmes on 13 measures of diabetes care, including: glycaemic control (e.g. mean glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c)); cardiovascular risk factor management (e.g. mean systolic blood pressure (SBP), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), proportion of people living with diabetes that quit smoking or receiving cardiovascular medications); and screening/prevention of microvascular complications (e.g. proportion of patients receiving retinopathy or foot screening); and harms (e.g. proportion of patients experiencing adverse hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia). We modelled the association of each QI strategy with outcomes using a series of hierarchical multivariable meta-regression models in a Bayesian framework. The previous version of this review identified that different strategies were more or less effective depending on baseline levels of outcomes. To explore this further, we extended the main additive model for continuous outcomes (HbA1c, SBP and LDL-C) to include an interaction term between each strategy and average baseline risk for each study (baseline thresholds were based on a data-driven approach; we used the median of all baseline values reported in the trials). Based on model diagnostics, the baseline interaction models for HbA1c, SBP and LDL-C performed better than the main model and are therefore presented as the primary analyses for these outcomes. Based on the model results, we qualitatively ordered each QI strategy within three tiers (Top, Middle, Bottom) based on its magnitude of effect relative to the other QI strategies, where 'Top' indicates that the QI strategy was likely one of the most effective strategies for that specific outcome. Secondary analyses explored the sensitivity of results to choices in model specification and priors. Additional information about the methods and results of the review are available as Appendices in an online repository. This review will be maintained as a living systematic review; we will update our syntheses as more data become available. We identified 553 trials (428 patient-randomised and 125 cluster-randomised trials), including a total of 412,161 participants. Of the included studies, 66% involved people living with type 2 diabetes only. Participants were 50% female and the median age of participants was 58.4 years. The mean duration of follow-up was 12.5 months. HbA1c was the commonest reported outcome; screening outcomes and outcomes related to cardiovascular medications, smoking and harms were reported infrequently. The most frequently evaluated QI strategies across all study arms were PE, PSM and CM, while the least frequently evaluated QI strategies included AF, FI and CQI. Our confidence in the evidence is limited due to a lack of information on how studies were conducted. Four QI strategies (CM, TC, PE, PSM) were consistently identified as 'Top' across the majority of outcomes. All QI strategies were ranked as 'Top' for at least one key outcome. The majority of effects of individual QI strategies were modest, but when used in combination could result in meaningful population-level improvements across the majority of outcomes. The median number of QI strategies in multicomponent QI programmes was three. Combinations of the three most effective QI strategies were estimated to lead to the below effects: - PR + PSM + CE: decrease in HbA1c by 0.41% (credibility interval (CrI) -0.61 to -0.22) when baseline HbA1c < 8.3%; - CM + PE + EPR: decrease in HbA1c by 0.62% (CrI -0.84 to -0.39) when baseline HbA1c > 8.3%; - PE + TC + PSM: reduction in SBP by 2.14 mmHg (CrI -3.80 to -0.52) when baseline SBP < 136 mmHg; - CM + TC + PSM: reduction in SBP by 4.39 mmHg (CrI -6.20 to -2.56) when baseline SBP > 136 mmHg; - TC + PE + CM: LDL-C lowering of 5.73 mg/dL (CrI -7.93 to -3.61) when baseline LDL < 107 mg/dL; - TC + CM + CR: LDL-C lowering by 5.52 mg/dL (CrI -9.24 to -1.89) when baseline LDL > 107 mg/dL. Assuming a baseline screening rate of 50%, the three most effective QI strategies were estimated to lead to an absolute improvement of 33% in retinopathy screening (PE + PR + TC) and 38% absolute increase in foot screening (PE + TC + Other). There is a significant body of evidence about QI programmes to improve the management of diabetes. Multicomponent QI programmes for diabetes care (comprised of effective QI strategies) may achieve meaningful population-level improvements across the majority of outcomes. For health system decision-makers, the evidence summarised in this review can be used to identify strategies to include in QI programmes. For researchers, this synthesis identifies higher-priority QI strategies to examine in further research regarding how to optimise their evaluation and effects. We will maintain this as a living systematic review.","Diabetes, a disorder of how sugar is managed by the body, can lead to complications such as heart disease and blindness. If people with diabetes get the best possible treatment, their risk for these and other diabetes-related complications will be lowered. Unfortunately, many people with diabetes do not get the best possible treatment.
Quality improvement programmes using different strategies help healthcare professionals improve care. We examined 12 common types of quality improvement strategies.
- Four strategies were directed at healthcare professionals: audit and feedback, clinician education, clinician reminders and financial incentives.
- Three strategies were directed at people living with diabetes: patient education, patient reminders and promotion of self-management.
- Five strategies involved healthcare organisations: case management, team changes, electronic patient registry, facilitated relay of clinical information and continuous quality improvement.
We wanted to find out which strategies worked best to improve:
- blood sugar control (measured using a test called glycated haemoglobin or HbA1c);
- blood pressure;
- low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C).
Lower levels on these tests are associated with lower rates of complications such as heart attacks.
We also assessed whether quality improvement strategies improved rates of screening for eye damage (also known as retinopathy) and loss of sensation in the foot (also known as neuropathy). Routine screening for these issues in people living with diabetes is recommended to prevent blindness or amputation, respectively.
We searched for randomised trials including adults living with diabetes managed in outpatient settings, which evaluated at least one quality improvement strategy. Although we were interested in strategies directed at people living with diabetes, patient strategies needed to be tested in combination with strategies directed at healthcare organisations or professionals for the study to be included. We summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods, size and other considerations.
We found 553 studies that involved 412,161 people with diabetes up to the year 2019. Studies took place in countries around the world with most being conducted in the USA (231) and in medical settings.
Most studies (367) involved people with type 2 diabetes. Half of the study participants were female. The average age of participants was 57 years. Most studies lasted 12 months.
Studies usually used multiple quality improvement strategies together. Most commonly, studies featured three quality improvement strategies.
Overall, case management, team changes, patient education and promotion of self-management appeared to be the most effective quality improvement strategies for diabetes care.
When considering three-strategy combinations (the median number of quality improvement strategies in multicomponent interventions), the combination of clinician education, promotion of self-management and patient reminders may lead to the most improvement in blood sugar control in people who begin with lower HbA1c. Whereas the combination of case management, patient education and electronic patient registries may lead to the largest improvement in blood sugar control for people who begin with higher HbA1c.
For blood pressure, people who have lower systolic blood pressure may see the most improvement with the combination of patient education, team changes and promotion of self-management. People who have higher systolic blood pressure may improve the most with the combination of case management, team changes and promotion of self-management.
For cholesterol, we found that team changes, patient education and case management may lead to the most improvement in people who already have lower low-density lipoprotein levels. For those who have higher levels of low-density lipoprotein, team changes, case management and clinician reminders may lead to the largest improvement.
Patient education, patient reminders and team changes may lead to an increase in retinopathy screening rates. Patient education, team changes and audit and feedback, financial incentives and continuous quality improvement strategies combined may lead to an increase in foot screening rates.
Clinics can improve their diabetes care by engaging in quality improvement programmes (especially those including case management, team changes, patient education and patient self-management).
Many studies did not provide information on everything we were interested in. Most focused on blood sugar control and few studies reported screening rates.

6680de3494e4607dcf95530d,finetuned_5,Acetylcysteine and carbocysteine to treat acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections in children without chronic broncho-pulmonary disease,"Acetylcysteine and carbocysteine are the most commonly prescribed mucolytic drugs in Brazil and many European and African countries. To our knowledge, no systematic review has been published on their efficacy and safety for acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections (RTIs) in children without chronic broncho-pulmonary disease. The objective was to assess the efficacy and safety and to establish a benefit-risk ratio of acetylcysteine and carbocysteine as symptomatic treatments for acute upper and lower RTIs in paediatric patients without chronic broncho-pulmonary disease. We searched CENTRAL (2013, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 to February week 3, 2013), EMBASE (1980 to March 2013), Micromedex (2010), Pascal (1987 to 2004) and Science Citation Index (1974 to March 2013). To study efficacy, we used randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the use of acetylcysteine or carbocysteine versus placebo, either alone or as an add-on therapy. To study safety, we used trials comparing acetylcysteine or carbocysteine versus active treatment or no treatment and case reports. In this review update two review authors (YD, MC), with help from a colleague, extracted data and assessed trial quality. We performed a subgroup analysis of children younger than two years of age. We included six trials involving 497 participants to study efficacy. They showed some benefit (e.g. reduction of cough at day seven) from mucolytic agents, although differences were of little clinical relevance. No conclusion was drawn about the subgroup of infants younger than two years because data were unavailable. Thirty-four studies, including the previous six trials involving 2064 children, were eligible to study safety. Overall safety was good but very few data were available to evaluate safety in infants younger than two years. However, 59 cases of paradoxically increased bronchorrhoea observed in infants were reported to the French pharmacovigilance system. The results have to be interpreted with caution because they are based on a limited number of participants included in studies whose methodological quality is questionable. Acetylcysteine and carbocysteine seem to have a limited efficacy and appear to be safe in children older than two years. These results should take into consideration the fact that acetylcysteine and carbocysteine are prescribed for self limiting diseases (for example, acute cough, bronchitis). Given strong concerns about safety, these drugs should only be used for acute upper and lower RTIs in the context of a RCT with regards to children younger than two years.","Acetylcysteine and carbocysteine are the most commonly prescribed drugs intended to modify the structure of bronchial secretions. This systematic review evaluated their efficacy and safety for treating acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections in children without chronic broncho-pulmonary disease, with particular attention to children younger than two years of age. Forty-nine trials met the inclusion criteria. Six trials involving 497 participants were used to assess efficacy, comparing acetylcysteine or carbocysteine with placebo. Thirty-four trials, including those six, were eligible to assess safety and involved 2064 paediatric patients. The results suggest that acetylcysteine and carbocysteine have real but limited efficacy, such as reducing cough by day seven, and appear generally safe aside from rare mild gastrointestinal side effects in children older than two years. However, these conclusions are limited by the small number of participants and questionable methodological quality. Their use should also be considered in light of the fact that these drugs are prescribed for self-limiting illnesses such as acute cough and bronchitis.

6680de3494e4607dcf95530d,finetuned_6,Is liraglutide an effective weight-loss treatment for adults living with obesity and does it cause unwanted effects?,"To assess the effects of liraglutide, a GLP-1RA, for adults living with obesity, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and two trials registries on 17 December 2024. Liraglutide likely increases the proportion of people achieving at least 5% weight loss at medium-term follow-up; this effect is likely to be sustained at longer-term follow-up. Medium- or long-term impact on percentage weight change, MACE, quality of life, and mortality may be limited or uncertain. Liraglutide may lead to an increase in adverse events, including serious adverse events in both the medium and long term, which might further limit the sustainability of the initial effects. The drug manufacturer funded 22 studies, raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest. Further independent and long-term studies are needed to better understand the broader effects of liraglutide in the management of obesity.","Obesity is a long-term condition in which a person has too much body fat. It can increase the risk of health problems like type 2 diabetes, diseases of the heart and blood vessels (cardiovascular disease), and some types of cancer. Obesity levels are increasing worldwide, placing a significant burden on healthcare systems. Managing obesity usually involves lifestyle changes such as eating a healthier diet and being more physically active. However, many people find these changes difficult to maintain, and doctors may prescribe medications to support weight loss. Liraglutide is a type of medication that helps people feel full sooner, and so eat less. It was originally developed to treat type 2 diabetes but has been approved in many countries to help people lose weight. It is given as a daily injection. Some people taking liraglutide experience unwanted effects, such as feeling or being sick, diarrhoea and constipation. Liraglutide is a  GLP-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA). Similar medications include semaglutide and tirzepatide. We wanted to know how well liraglutide works in adults with obesity in the medium term (6 to 24 months) and long term (24 months or more). We examined its effects on weight, unwanted effects, obesity-related health problems, quality of life and risk of death. We did not look at what happens after people stop taking liraglutide. We searched for studies that investigated liraglutide for adults living with obesity. Studies could investigate any dose of liraglutide compared with placebo (sham medication), no treatment, lifestyle changes or another weight-loss medication. We included studies in which people took liraglutide for at least 6 months. We compared and analysed the results and assessed our confidence in the evidence. We found 24 studies with 9937 men and women with obesity, aged between 31 and 64 years. Some people had weight-related conditions like diabetes or liver disease. Most studies compared liraglutide with placebo. They mainly took place in high- and middle-income countries. People who took liraglutide were more likely to lose at least 5% of their body weight than those who took a placebo in the medium (18 studies, 6651 people) and long term (2 studies, 1262 people). However, we are uncertain about liraglutide's effects on people's overall percentage weight change from the beginning of the study to the medium term (16 studies, 6050 people) and there may be little to no difference in percentage weight change in the long term (2 studies, 1262 people). In the medium term, people taking liraglutide might experience more unwanted effects of any kind (16 studies, 8147 people) and more serious unwanted effects (20 studies, 8487 people) than those taking placebo. We are unsure about mild-to-moderate unwanted effects (17 studies, 7440 people) or whether unwanted effects caused people to stop treatment (19 studies, 8628 people). In the long term (2 studies, 2640 participants), liraglutide may increase unwanted effects and people may be more likely to stop treatment because of them. We are unsure about unwanted events overall and mild-to-moderate unwanted effects. Liraglutide probably makes little or no difference to quality of life both in the medium term (6 studies, 3733 people) and in the long term (1 study, 863 people). Liraglutide probably makes little or no difference to major cardiovascular events in the medium term (6 studies, 5762 people). We are unsure about its effects on major cardiovascular events in the long term and on deaths in the medium and long term. We are moderately confident that people taking liraglutide lose more weight than those taking placebo. However, our confidence in the other evidence is limited because of how the studies were conducted and information that was missing. Few studies looked at long-term effects or included different people from different places, so the results may not apply to everyone.

6680de3494e4607dcf95530d,finetuned_6,Interventions to prevent asthma attacks in children upon return to school in the autumn,"Asthma exacerbations in school-aged children peak in autumn shortly after they return to school, likely due to factors such as poor treatment adherence, increased allergen and viral exposure, and changes in immune tolerance. Because this seasonal peak is predictable occurring in September in the Northern Hemisphere and February in the Southern Hemisphere targeted interventions may help reduce exacerbations and lessen the strain on health services. This review assessed the effects of pharmacological and behavioural interventions implemented before school return to reduce autumn asthma exacerbations in children. We searched major trial registries and databases up to 1 December 2017, with no language restrictions. We included randomised controlled trials comparing pre-autumn interventions with usual care in children aged 18 years or younger. Standard Cochrane methods were used for study selection, data extraction, and bias assessment. The primary outcome was the proportion of children experiencing an asthma exacerbation requiring hospitalisation or oral corticosteroids during autumn. Of 546 trials screened, five met the inclusion criteria, enrolling 14,252 children. All studies were conducted in the Northern Hemisphere. Three interventions used leukotriene receptor antagonists, one used omalizumab or an inhaled corticosteroid boost, and the largest study (12,179 children) used a medication reminder letter. Although individual studies generally had low risk of bias, the evidence quality was downgraded due to imprecision, inconsistency, and indirect outcome measurement. Only one US study involving 513 children with asthma and allergic sensitisation reported data for the primary outcome. In this study, exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids or hospitalisation within 90 days of school return were reduced to 11.3% in the omalizumab group compared with 21.0% in the placebo group. The other studies used different exacerbation definitions. A pooled analysis of two leukotriene receptor antagonist trials found no effect on exacerbations, and the reminder-letter intervention did not reduce unscheduled respiratory healthcare contacts between September and December. Four studies reported adverse events, with no evidence of differences between intervention and usual care groups. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were not possible due to insufficient data. Seasonal omalizumab treatment starting four to six weeks before school return may reduce autumn asthma exacerbations, with no increase in adverse effects aside from injection site pain, although the treatment is costly. There was no evidence regarding effects on asthma control, quality of life, or mortality. Future trials should clearly define exacerbations, standardise outcome measures, and carefully characterise participants to allow analysis of subgroup effects.","Asthma is a long-term condition affecting the lungs. It is the most common long-term condition affecting children. One in 11 children in the United Kingdom have asthma. People with asthma can experience asthma 'attacks' of coughing, wheezing, and difficulty breathing. Each year there is a peak in asthma attacks after school restarts in autumn. The likely reason for this is that children are exposed to more viruses that can trigger asthma. Children may also have taken their regular medication less consistently with the break in routine over the summer. As this increase in attacks at the start of the school year is predictable, and the reason for it is somewhat understood, it might be preventable. Approaches to reducing autumn asthma attacks include using extra medications when school restarts or medication reminders during the school holiday. Our searches found 546 trials, of which five were relevant. In total, 14,252 children were randomly assigned to receive either an intervention targeting autumn asthma attacks or usual care. Four small studies (approximately 200 to 1200 children in each) gave children extra asthma medication; these additional medications were omalizumab, leukotriene receptor antagonist tablets, or increased doses of inhaled steroids. One study sent a medication reminder letter over the summer holidays to parents of children with asthma. One trial gave children either omalizumab or placebo. Omalizumab is an antibody designed to alter the immune response. It was given by injection regularly over four to six weeks before school return (i.e. over the bulk of the summer holidays). The children in this study had known allergic asthma. The study showed that omalizumab might reduce autumn attacks. Eleven per cent of those receiving omalizumab had an asthma attack during the first 90 days compared to 21% of those receiving placebo. Three studies used leukotriene receptor antagonist tablets, either montelukast or pranlukast. Although the results of one study suggested that seasonal montelukast might reduce autumn attacks, there was no evidence of reduced attacks in the other two later trials, including a second larger trial of montelukast. There was no evidence that sending a reminder letter reduces the number of children requiring an unplanned healthcare contact. No study provided evidence that the total number of children experiencing adverse events was greater in the intervention than in the usual care group. Our findings were limited by the small numbers of studies identified and because these studies used different interventions and definitions of asthma exacerbations. Further research is needed to better understand how to prevent seasonal attacks, including interventions suitable for children with mild asthma, where expensive and painful treatments are not justified.",1078,asthma exacerbations; allergic sensitisation; leukotriene receptor antagonists; omalizumab; inhaled corticosteroid boost; oral corticosteroids; placebo group; unscheduled respiratory healthcare contacts; adverse events; asthma control,How do the various interventions compare in their effectiveness to reduce autumn asthma attacks?,What was the primary purpose of the study discussed in the summary?,Select all of the following that are fruits,How did the seasonal omalizumab treatment affect asthma exacerbations in the study?,What problem is associated with the increase of asthma attacks in autumn?,Omalizumab proved more effective than leukotriene receptor antagonists.; The medication reminder letter showed the highest reduction in attacks.; All interventions showed equal effectiveness.,Omalizumab proved more effective than leukotriene receptor antagonists.,To assess the effects of pre-autumn interventions on asthma exacerbations in children.; To find new medications for asthma treatment.; To study summer activities of children with asthma.,To assess the effects of pre-autumn interventions on asthma exacerbations in children.,dog; blue; grape,grape,Reduced exacerbations by 11%; Reduced exacerbations to 11% of occurrences; Increased exacerbations by 21%,Reduced exacerbations to 11% of occurrences,Increased contact with triggers such as viruses; Children change their class schedules; Decrease in temperatures leading to cold symptoms,Increased contact with triggers such as viruses
605fbc12c61d8d10250f6e51,static_1,Prophylactic antibiotic therapy for people with chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD),"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; including chronic bronchitis and emphysema) is a chronic respiratory condition characterised by shortness of breath, cough and recurrent exacerbations. Long-term antibiotic use may reduce both bacterial load and inflammation in the airways. Studies have shown a reduction of exacerbations with antibiotics in comparison to placebo in people with COPD, but there are concerns about antibiotic resistance and safety. To compare the safety and efficacy of different classes of antibiotics (continuous, intermittent or pulsed) for prophylaxis of exacerbations in patients with COPD.
We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Trials Register and bibliographies of relevant studies. The latest literature search was conducted on 6 February 2019.
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were selected that compared one prophylactic antibiotic with another in patients with COPD.
We used the standard Cochrane methods. Two independent review authors selected trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Discrepancies were resolved by involving a third review author.
We included two RCTs, both published in 2015 involving a total of 391 participants with treatment duration of 12 to 13 weeks. One RCT compared a quinolone (moxifloxacin pulsed, for 5 days every 4 weeks), with a tetracycline (doxycycline continuous) or a macrolide (azithromycin intermittent). The second RCT compared a tetracycline (doxycycline continuous) plus a macrolide (roxithromycin continuous), with roxithromycin (continuous) alone. The trials recruited participants with a mean age of 68 years, with moderate-severity COPD. Both trials included participants who had between two and five exacerbations in the previous one to two years. In one trial, 17% of patients had previously been using inhaled corticosteroids. In the other study, all patients were positive for Chlamydophila pneumoniae (C pneumoniae). Overall, we judged the evidence presented to be of very low-certainty, mainly due to imprecision, but we also had concerns about indirectness and methodological quality of the included studies. The primary outcome measures for this review included exacerbations, quality of life, drug resistance and serious adverse events. Macrolide + tetracycline versus macrolide There was no clear difference between treatments in improvement in quality of life as assessed by the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ). The CRQ scale ranges from 0 to 10 and higher scores on the scale indicate better quality of life. CRQ sub-scales for dyspnoea (mean difference (MD) 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.84 to 2.00; 187 participants; very low-certainty evidence), fatigue (MD 0.02, 95% CI -1.08 to 1.12; 187 participants; very low-certainty evidence), emotional function (MD -0.37, 95% CI -1.74 to 1.00; 187 participants; very low-certainty evidence), or mastery (MD -0.79, 95% CI -1.86 to 0.28; 187 participants; very low-certainty evidence) at 12 weeks. For serious adverse events, it was uncertain if there was a difference between combined roxithromycin and doxycycline versus roxithromycin alone at 48 weeks follow-up after active treatment of 12 weeks (odds ratio (OR) 1.00, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.93; 198 participants; very low-certainty evidence). There were five deaths reported in the combined treatment arm, versus three in the single treatment arm at 48 weeks follow-up after active treatment of 12 weeks (OR 1.63, 95% CI 0.38 to 7.02; 198 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Quinolone versus tetracycline There was no clear difference between moxifloxacin and doxycycline for the number of participants experiencing one or more exacerbations (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.38; 50 participants, very low-certainty evidence) at 13 weeks. There were no serious adverse events or deaths reported in either treatment groups. We did not identify any evidence for our other primary outcomes. Quinolone versus macrolide There was no clear difference between moxifloxacin and azithromycin for the number of participants experiencing one or more exacerbations (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.32 to 3.10; 50 participants; very low-certainty evidence) at 13 weeks. There were no serious adverse events or deaths reported in either treatment groups. We did not identify any evidence for our other primary outcomes. Marcolide versus tetracycline There was no clear difference between azithromycin and doxycycline for the number of participants experiencing one or more exacerbations (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.38; 50 participants; very low-certainty evidence) at 13 weeks. There were no serious adverse events or deaths reported in either treatment groups. We did not identify any evidence for our other primary outcomes. We did not find head-to-head evidence for impact of antibiotics on drug resistance. It is not clear from the evidence included in this review whether there is a difference in efficacy or safety between different classes or regimens of prophylactic antibiotic, given for 12 to 13 weeks to people with COPD. Whilst no head-to-head comparisons of antibiotic resistance were identified, concerns about this continue. The sample size in this review is small and both included studies are of short duration. Thus, there is considerable uncertainty in effects observed and the effects of different prophylactic antibiotics requires further research.","COPD is a common condition caused mainly by smoking and can lead to long-term breathing problems. Symptoms include shortness of breath, and cough with sputum production due to airways and lung damage. Infection can trigger severe symptoms, with breathing becoming worse and increased cough and sputum. This is more commonly known as an exacerbation or 'flare-up' which can cause further damage to lung function. Frequent exacerbations can lead to hospital admissions, reduced quality of life, and increase the risk of death.
We wanted to know whether one preventative antibiotic was better than another preventative antibiotic in reducing exacerbations, and improving quality of life for people with COPD.
We found two randomised trials, including 391 people with COPD. The participants had an average age of 68 years. The first study included three groups of COPD patients taking either moxifloxacin (daily for 5 days every 4 weeks), doxycycline (daily for 13 weeks) or azithromycin (3 times per week for 13 weeks). The second study investigated the use of doxycycline (daily) in addition to roxithromycin (daily) for 12 weeks in COPD. Our main outcomes were number of exacerbations, quality of life, serious side effects (known as 'adverse events') and antibiotic resistance.
Overall, we were unable to determine any difference between one antibiotic compared with each other in improving the main outcomes we measured.
We were unclear whether one antibiotic was better or worse than another in terms of reducing exacerbations or improving quality of life. Neither of the studies reported a comparison between antibiotics for drug resistance.
In one study lasting 13 weeks we found no serious side effects of taking moxifloxacin, azithromycin or doxycycline, and no deaths were reported. In the other study, very similar numbers of people experienced serious side effects in both the combined antibiotic and single antibiotic treatment groups after 12 weeks of treatment and 48 weeks of follow-up. However, the numbers were small so we are not sure if one treatment option may cause more side effects than the other. In the same study, five people in the combined treatment group died, compared to three people in the single treatment group. Again, these numbers are too small to draw any conclusions.
We were very uncertain about the results due to finding only two small studies that gave people with COPD antibiotics for only 12 or 13 weeks. The studies only looked at four different antibiotics and did not measure all the things we were interested in.",1080,Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; exacerbations; moxifloxacin; doxycycline; azithromycin; roxithromycin; inhaled corticosteroids; Chlamydophila pneumoniae; adverse events; antibiotic resistance,"If no evidence for a single advantageous antibiotic is proven, what could be a reason to continue researching different antibiotics in COPD?",What is the primary motivation of the study regarding COPD management?,Select all of the following that are colors,Summarize the conclusion about antibiotic efficacy mentioned in the summary.,Describe the overall certainty of the study's results.,To explore variations in individual patient responses.; To eliminate the need for antibiotics in COPD management.; To investigate impacts on disease progression not yet identified.,To explore variations in individual patient responses.; To investigate impacts on disease progression not yet identified.,To find a clear link between antibiotic use and increased lung function.; To compare the effectiveness of different antibiotics in preventing exacerbations.; To determine the impact of COPD on heart disease.,To compare the effectiveness of different antibiotics in preventing exacerbations.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,One preventative antibiotic was significantly better than others in reducing exacerbations.; No clear difference was determined between antibiotics in improving outcomes.; Macrolides were shown to be the most effective.,No clear difference was determined between antibiotics in improving outcomes.,Highly certain due to large sample size.; Very uncertain due to limited sample size and duration.; Moderately certain with strong evidence.,Very uncertain due to limited sample size and duration.
605fbc12c61d8d10250f6e51,static_2,Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor agonists for acute stroke,"Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor agonists have been shown to have a neuroprotectant effect in reducing infarct size and improving functional outcome in animal models of cerebrovascular disease. However, the sedative effects of GABA receptor agonists have limited their wider application in people with acute stroke, due to the potential risk of stupor. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2013, and previously updated in 2014 and 2016. To determine the efficacy and safety of GABA receptor agonists in the treatment of acute stroke. We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (accessed May 2018), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) 2018, Issue 4 (accessed May 2018), MEDLINE (from 1949 to May 2018), Embase (from 1980 to May 2018), CINAHL (from 1982 to May 2018), AMED (from 1985 to May 2018), and 11 Chinese databases (accessed May 2018). In an effort to identify further published, unpublished, and ongoing trials we searched ongoing trial registers, reference lists, and relevant conference proceedings, and contacted authors and pharmaceutical companies. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating GABA receptor agonists versus placebo for people with acute stroke (within 12 hours after stroke onset), with the primary outcomes of efficacy and safety. Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of identified records, selected studies for inclusion, extracted eligible data, cross-checked the data for accuracy, and assessed the risk of bias. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence. We included five trials with 3838 participants (acute ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke patients, 3758 analyzed). Most of the participants recruited had acute ischaemic stroke, with limited data available from participants with other stroke subtypes, including total anterior circulation syndrome (TACS). The methodological quality of the included trials was generally good, with an unclear risk for selection bias only. For death and dependency at three months, pooled results did not find a significant difference for chlormethiazole versus placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96 to 1.11; four trials; 2909 participants; moderate-quality evidence) and for diazepam versus placebo (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.07; one trial; 849 participants; moderate-quality evidence). The most frequent adverse events related to chlormethiazole were somnolence (RR 4.56, 95% CI 3.50 to 5.95; two trials; 2527 participants; moderate-quality evidence) and rhinitis (RR 4.75, 95% CI 2.67 to 8.46; two trials; 2527 participants; moderate-quality evidence). This review provides moderate-quality evidence that fails to support the use of GABA receptor agonists (chlormethiazole or diazepam) for the treatment of people with acute stroke. More well-designed RCTs with large samples of participants with total anterior circulation syndrome are required to determine if there are benefits for this subgroup. Somnolence and rhinitis are frequent adverse events related to chlormethiazole.","Background : GABA receptor agonists are a type of drug that may help protect the brain in acute stroke. This group of drugs, which includes diazepam and chlormethiazole, has been used as traditional sedatives for several decades, and have been found to be beneficial in stroke studies in animals. However, the sedative effect of GABA receptor agonists could be harmful for people with acute stroke. Study characteristics : We identified five studies to May 2018 that met our inclusion criteria; they randomized 3838 participants (acute ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke patients) and analyzed 3758. The quality of all the studies was generally good, with a low risk of bias. One study tested the effects and safety of diazepam for acute stroke in 849 participants within 12 hours of stroke onset. Four studies tested the effects and safety of chlormethiazole in 2909 participants with acute stroke, within 12 hours of stroke onset; 95 participants had stroke caused by bleeding and were analyzed separately. Key results : All five trials reported death and dependency at three months. There was no significant difference between the chlormethiazole and placebo groups or between the diazepam and placebo groups. The most frequent side effects caused by chlormethiazole were drowsiness and nasal irritation.

605fbc12c61d8d10250f6e51,static_2,Exercise training for bronchiectasis,"Bronchiectasis is characterised by excessive sputum production, chronic cough, and acute exacerbations and is associated with symptoms of dyspnoea and fatigue, which reduce exercise tolerance and impair quality of life. Exercise training in isolation or in conjunction with other interventions is beneficial for people with other respiratory diseases, but its effects in bronchiectasis have not been well established.
To determine effects of exercise training compared to usual care on exercise tolerance (primary outcome), quality of life (primary outcome), incidence of acute exacerbation and hospitalisation, respiratory and mental health symptoms, physical function, mortality, and adverse events in people with stable or acute exacerbation of bronchiectasis.
We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Specialised Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization trials portal, from their inception to October 2020. We reviewed respiratory conference abstracts and reference lists of all primary studies and review articles for additional references.
We included randomised controlled trials in which exercise training of at least four weeks' duration (or eight sessions) was compared to usual care for people with stable bronchiectasis or experiencing an acute exacerbation. Co-interventions with exercise training including education, respiratory muscle training, and airway clearance therapy were permitted if also applied as part of usual care.
Two review authors independently screened and selected trials for inclusion, extracted outcome data, and assessed risk of bias. We contacted study authors for missing data. We calculated mean differences (MDs) using a random-effects model. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence.
We included six studies, two of which were published as abstracts, with a total of 275 participants. Five studies were undertaken with people with clinically stable bronchiectasis, and one pilot study was undertaken post acute exacerbation. All studies included co-interventions such as instructions for airway clearance therapy and/or breathing strategies, provision of an educational booklet, and delivery of educational sessions. The duration of training ranged from six to eight weeks, with a mix of supervised and unsupervised sessions conducted in the outpatient or home setting. No studies of children were included in the review; however we identified two studies as currently ongoing. No data were available regarding physical activity levels or adverse events. For people with stable bronchiectasis, evidence suggests that exercise training compared to usual care improves functional exercise tolerance as measured by the incremental shuttle walk distance, with a mean difference (MD) between groups of 87 metres (95% confidence interval (CI) 43 to 132 metres; 4 studies, 161 participants; low-certainty evidence). Evidence also suggests that exercise training improves six-minute walk distance (6MWD) (MD between groups of 42 metres, 95% CI 22 to 62; 1 study, 76 participants; low-certainty evidence). The magnitude of these observed mean changes appears clinically relevant as they exceed minimal clinically important difference (MCID) thresholds for people with chronic lung disease. Evidence suggests that quality of life improves following exercise training according to St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score (MD -9.62 points, 95% CI -15.67 to -3.56 points; 3 studies, 160 participants; low-certainty evidence), which exceeds the MCID of 4 points for this outcome. A reduction in dyspnoea (MD 1.0 points, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.53; 1 study, 76 participants) and fatigue (MD 1.51 points, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.22 points; 1 study, 76 participants) was observed following exercise training according to these domains of the Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire. However, there was no change in cough-related quality of life as measured by the Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ) (MD -0.09 points, 95% CI -0.98 to 0.80 points; 2 studies, 103 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), nor in anxiety or depression. Two studies reported longer-term outcomes up to 12 months after intervention completion; however exercise training did not appear to improve exercise capacity or quality of life more than usual care. Exercise training reduced the number of acute exacerbations of bronchiectasis over 12 months in people with stable bronchiectasis (odds ratio 0.26, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.81; 1 study, 55 participants). After an acute exacerbation of bronchiectasis, data from a single study (N = 27) suggest that exercise training compared to usual care confers little to no effect on exercise capacity (MD 11 metres, 95% CI -27 to 49 metres; low-certainty evidence), SGRQ total score (MD 6.34 points, 95%CI -17.08 to 29.76 points), or LCQ score (MD -0.08 points, 95% CI -0.94 to 0.78 points; low-certainty evidence) and does not reduce the time to first exacerbation (hazard ratio 0.83, 95% CI 0.31 to 2.22).
This review provides low-certainty evidence suggesting improvement in functional exercise capacity and quality of life immediately following exercise training in people with stable bronchiectasis; however the effects of exercise training on cough-related quality of life and psychological symptoms appear to be minimal. Due to inadequate reporting of methods, small study numbers, and variation between study findings, evidence is of very low to moderate certainty. Limited evidence is available to show longer-term effects of exercise training on these outcomes.","We wanted to know whether exercise training improves exercise tolerance, quality of life, or symptoms, and whether it reduces the number of future flare-ups (exacerbations) in people with bronchiectasis compared to those who did not participate in exercise training. We examined studies involving people with stable disease as well as those recovering from a recent flare-up, aiming to include evidence for both children and adults, although no studies involving children were found. Bronchiectasis causes chronic cough and sputum production, and people with this condition have an increased risk of exacerbations that worsen exercise tolerance and quality of life. While exercise training benefits people with other chronic lung conditions, its effects in bronchiectasis are less well understood. The evidence is current up to October 2020 and includes six studies with 275 participants, five of which involved people with stable disease. Exercise training was delivered alongside other treatments such as airway clearance therapy, respiratory muscle training, and education. Participants were randomly assigned to either exercise training or no exercise training. Training lasted at least six weeks and took place either in group settings or at home. None of the studies were funded by commercial companies. After completing exercise training, participants in a stable condition walked farther than those who did not train, with an average increase of 87 meters, although certainty of evidence is low. Participants also reported improved quality of life, less shortness of breath, and reduced fatigue. Moderate-certainty evidence showed that exercise training might not specifically improve cough-related symptoms, but the incidence of acute exacerbations was lower. Evidence was insufficient to determine whether the benefits lasted beyond the training period or whether exercise training increased overall physical activity. No benefits were observed for people who began exercise training soon after an acute flare-up. The certainty of evidence ranged from very low to moderate due to uncertainty in effect size, limitations in study design, and insufficient data. More studies with larger sample sizes are needed to understand the long-term effects of exercise training in people with bronchiectasis regardless of their clinical stability.",1074,Bronchiectasis; sputum production; dyspnoea; exercise tolerance; acute exacerbations; Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire; Leicester Cough Questionnaire; airway clearance therapy; co-interventions; minimal clinically important difference,What conclusions can be drawn about the impact of exercise training on the quality of life in bronchiectasis patients according to the summary?,"Based on the summary, what challenges remain unresolved for exercise training in bronchiectasis?",Select all of the following that are fruits,What was the primary objective of the study?,Describe the effect of exercise training on exercise tolerance in stable bronchiectasis patients.,Exercise training significantly improves the quality of life for stable bronchiectasis patients.; The improvement in quality of life is indefinite and requires further study.; Exercise training did not improve the quality of life at all.,Exercise training significantly improves the quality of life for stable bronchiectasis patients.; The improvement in quality of life is indefinite and requires further study.,Long-term benefits beyond the training period.; Initial high cost of exercise programs.; Effectiveness for people after acute flare-ups.,Long-term benefits beyond the training period.; Effectiveness for people after acute flare-ups.,dog; blue; grape,grape,To determine the effects of exercise training in people with bronchiectasis; To analyze the dietary habits of bronchiectasis patients; To evaluate the economic impact of bronchiectasis,To determine the effects of exercise training in people with bronchiectasis,Increases exercise tolerance; Decreases exercise tolerance; No effect on exercise tolerance,Increases exercise tolerance
605fbc12c61d8d10250f6e51,interactive_3,Are exercises for strengthening breathing muscles effective for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease?,"Inspiratory muscle training (IMT) aims to improve respiratory muscle strength and endurance. Clinical trials have used different training protocols, devices, and respiratory measurements to assess its effectiveness. Current guidelines suggest a possible benefit of IMT, particularly in people with respiratory muscle weakness, but it remains unclear how clinically useful IMT is, especially when combined with pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). We evaluated the effect of IMT on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), both as a stand-alone intervention and when combined with PR. We searched major medical databases and clinical trial registries up to 20 October 2022 and reviewed reference lists of relevant studies. We included randomized controlled trials comparing IMT plus PR versus PR alone, and IMT versus control or sham, using any type of IMT delivery. We excluded trials using resistive devices without breathing-pattern control or with training loads under 30% of maximal inspiratory pressure. Standard Cochrane methods and the RoB 2 tool were used. Primary outcomes included dyspnea, functional exercise capacity, and health-related quality of life. We included 55 RCTs. Interventions varied widely in duration, training load, devices, session frequency, and PR program structure. Only eight trials had low risk of bias. In the comparison of PR plus IMT versus PR alone, we found 22 trials with 1446 participants. IMT added to PR did not improve dyspnea on the Borg scale or the mMRC scale, and effects did not reach clinically meaningful differences. The 6-minute walk distance increased by 5.95 meters but did not reach the threshold for clinical improvement. Subgroup analyses showed no significant differences based on training duration or baseline inspiratory pressure. St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire and COPD Assessment Test scores also did not show clinically meaningful improvements. PImax increased by 11.46 cmH?O but did not meet the minimum clinically important difference, and subgroup analyses again showed no clear modifiers of effect. One abstract reported minor, self-limited adverse effects. In the comparison of IMT versus control or sham, 37 trials with 1021 participants were included. IMT showed a trend toward improved Borg dyspnea scores, but evidence quality was very low. Eight studies using the BDI-TDI showed improvement only in the TDI total score. mMRC scores suggested possible improvement. IMT improved 6-minute walk distance by 35.71 meters, reaching moderate-certainty evidence. SGRQ total scores showed a modest effect in favor of IMT, but evidence was very low. CAT scores improved with IMT. PImax increased by 14.57 cmH?O but did not reach the clinically important threshold. Subgroup analyses again did not identify clear effect modifiers. No included trials reported adverse events. IMT may not improve dyspnea, functional exercise capacity, or quality of life when combined with PR, but IMT alone is likely to improve these outcomes. Whether greater effects occur in people with respiratory muscle weakness or with longer training durations remains uncertain.","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung condition in which the airways become blocked, causing shortness of breath and coughing. It typically develops after long-term exposure to irritating gases such as cigarette smoke and industrial chemicals. Strengthening the breathing muscles is thought to improve airflow and ease symptoms. Health professionals use different exercise approaches to help manage COPD. Some people follow general exercise and education programs to reduce symptoms and improve fitness and quality of life. Others perform breathing exercises using devices that strengthen the diaphragm and rib muscles by adding resistance; this is called inspiratory muscle training (IMT). These devices are also used by people with healthy lungs to improve athletic performance. We wanted to find out whether exercise combined with IMT works better than exercise alone, and whether IMT works better than no training or sham IMT, in improving breathlessness, physical fitness, and quality of life. (A sham device looks real but has no training effect, allowing a fair comparison.) We also wanted to check whether IMT causes any unwanted effects. We searched for studies comparing exercise plus IMT versus exercise alone, and IMT versus no training or sham IMT, then summarized the findings and evaluated the quality of the evidence. We found 22 studies with 1446 participants lasting from 2 to 24 weeks that compared exercise plus IMT to exercise alone. Exercise programs varied widely some used treadmill-only or cycling-only sessions, while others combined treadmill and cycling with muscle strengthening, stair climbing, and education. IMT devices and training durations also varied. Overall, adding IMT to exercise probably makes little to no difference in breathlessness, has unknown effects on physical fitness, may make little to no difference in quality of life, and probably makes little to no difference in breathing muscle strength. We also found 37 studies with 1021 participants lasting from 2 weeks to a year that compared IMT alone with no training or sham IMT. IMT protocols varied in devices, resistance levels, frequency, and supervision. IMT alone may reduce breathlessness on one measurement scale but shows unclear effects on two others; it probably improves physical fitness; it probably improves quality of life on one scale but shows unclear benefits on another; and it may make little to no difference to breathing muscle strength. These findings are limited by differences in training duration, devices, resistance levels, frequency of sessions, and exercise programs. Many studies were small, and some participants may have known which treatment they received. Because of this variability, our confidence in the overall conclusions is reduced.",1073,Inspiratory muscle training; respiratory muscle strength; pulmonary rehabilitation; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; resistive devices; dyspnea; Borg scale; mMRC scale; PImax; BDI-TDI,What was the main goal of the study?,Which condition was primarily targeted in the study?,Select the items that are animals,What did the study evaluate about IMT combined with exercise?,Explain the difference between IMT alone and combined with exercise in the context of this study.,To determine if IMT reduces breathlessness.; To assess the sales of IMT devices.; To train health professionals in IMT.,To determine if IMT reduces breathlessness.,Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).; Asthma.; Lung cancer.,Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,"Improvement in breathlessness, physical fitness, and quality of life.; Suitability for treating asthma.; Effects on cognitive function.","Improvement in breathlessness, physical fitness, and quality of life.","IMT alone may improve breathlessness and fitness, but combining it with exercise may offer little additional benefit.; IMT alone is better for mental health, whereas exercise improves lung capacity.; IMT combined with exercise improves bone density.","IMT alone may improve breathlessness and fitness, but combining it with exercise may offer little additional benefit."
605fbc12c61d8d10250f6e51,interactive_4,Aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for the prevention of dementia,"Dementia is a worldwide concern. Its global prevalence is increasing. At present, there is no medication licensed to prevent or delay the onset of dementia. Inflammation has been suggested as a key factor in dementia pathogenesis. Therefore, medications with anti-inflammatory properties could be beneficial for dementia prevention. To evaluate the effectiveness and adverse effects of aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for the primary or secondary prevention of dementia. We searched ALOIS, the specialised register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group up to 9 January 2020. ALOIS contains records of clinical trials identified from monthly searches of several major healthcare databases, trial registries and grey literature sources. We ran additional searches across MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP) and six other databases to ensure that the searches were as comprehensive and up-to-date as possible. We also reviewed citations of reference lists of included studies. We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) comparing aspirin or other NSAIDs with placebo for the primary or secondary prevention of dementia. We included trials with cognitively healthy participants (primary prevention) or participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or cognitive complaints (secondary prevention). We used standard methodological procedures according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We rated the strength of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach. We included four RCTs with 23,187 participants. Because of the diversity of these trials, we did not combine data to give summary estimates, but presented a narrative description of the evidence. We identified one trial (19,114 participants) comparing low-dose aspirin (100 mg once daily) to placebo. Participants were aged 70 years or older with no history of dementia, cardiovascular disease or physical disability. Interim analysis indicated no significant treatment effect and the trial was terminated slightly early after a median of 4.7 years' follow-up. There was no evidence of a difference in incidence of dementia between aspirin and placebo groups (risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.15; high-certainty evidence). Participants allocated aspirin had higher rates of major bleeding (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.60, high-certainty evidence) and slightly higher mortality (RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.28; high-certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in activities of daily living between groups (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.02; high-certainty evidence). We identified three trials comparing non-aspirin NSAIDs to placebo. All three trials were terminated early due to adverse events associated with NSAIDs reported in other trials. One trial (2528 participants) investigated the cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor celecoxib (200 mg twice daily) and the non-selective NSAID naproxen (220 mg twice daily) for preventing dementia in cognitively healthy older adults with a family history of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Median follow-up was 734 days. Combining both NSAID treatment arms, there was no evidence of a difference in the incidence of AD between participants allocated NSAIDs and those allocated placebo (RR 1.91, 95% CI 0.89 to 4.10; moderate-certainty evidence). There was also no evidence of a difference in rates of myocardial infarction (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.61 to 2.40), stroke (RR 1.82, 95% CI 0.76 to 4.37) or mortality (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.43) between treatment groups (all moderate-certainty evidence). One trial (88 participants) assessed the effectiveness of celecoxib (200 mg or 400 mg daily) in delaying cognitive decline in participants aged 40 to 81 years with mild age-related memory loss but normal memory performance scores. Mean duration of follow-up was 17.6 months in the celecoxib group and 18.1 months in the placebo group. There was no evidence of a difference between groups in test scores in any of six cognitive domains. Participants allocated celecoxib experienced more gastrointestinal adverse events than those allocated placebo (RR 2.66, 95% CI 1.05 to 6.75; low-certainty evidence). One trial (1457 participants) assessed the effectiveness of the COX-2 inhibitor rofecoxib (25 mg once daily) in delaying or preventing a diagnosis of AD in participants with MCI. Median duration of study participation was 115 weeks in the rofecoxib group and 130 weeks in the placebo group. There was a higher incidence of AD in the rofecoxib than the placebo group (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.72; moderate-certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between groups in cardiovascular adverse events (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.66; moderate-certainty evidence) or mortality (RR 1.62, 95% CI 0.85 to 3.05; moderate-certainty evidence). Participants allocated rofecoxib had more upper gastrointestinal adverse events (RR 3.53, 95% CI 1.17 to 10.68; moderate-certainty evidence). Reported annual mean difference scores showed no evidence of a difference between groups in activities of daily living (year 1: no data available; year 2: 0.0, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.2; year 3: 0.1, 95% CI - 0.1 to 0.3; year 4: 0.1, 95% CI -0.1 to 0.4; moderate-certainty evidence). There is no evidence to support the use of low-dose aspirin or other NSAIDs of any class (celecoxib, rofecoxib or naproxen) for the prevention of dementia, but there was evidence of harm. Although there were limitations in the available evidence, it seems unlikely that there is any need for further trials of low-dose aspirin for dementia prevention. If future studies of NSAIDs for dementia prevention are planned, they will need to be cognisant of the safety concerns arising from the existing studies.","Dementia is a worldwide healthcare concern. At present, there is no medicine that is proven to delay or prevent the onset of dementia. The biology of dementia is still poorly understood. However, there are reasons to believe that inflammation may be partly responsible for some of the brain changes seen in dementia. There are many medicines that have anti-inflammatory properties, including aspirin and NSAIDs that are often sold as pain killers. We wanted to see if these medicines had any effect on developing dementia. These medicines have a few potential side effects, including heart attack and bleeding, so we also assessed for any harmful effects of the medicines. We searched for relevant studies that had been published up to January 2020. We found four trials that met the inclusion criteria for this review (23,187 people). One trial was undertaken in the USA and Australia and three in the USA only. The trials included different populations. One was of aspirin in healthy people with no history of dementia, cardiovascular disease or physical disability. The other three were of NSAIDs other than aspirin and were conducted in healthy people with a family history of Alzheimer's disease, people with self-reported memory loss and people with mild cognitive impairment (a slight but noticeable and measurable decline in cognitive abilities, including memory and thinking skills). All of the included studies had limitations. The study of aspirin was stopped early due to ineffectiveness. The three studies of other NSAIDs (celecoxib, naproxen and rofecoxib) were stopped early due to concerns around the safety. This review found no evidence to support the use of either aspirin or other NSAIDs for the prevention of dementia and, in fact, there was some suggestion that they may cause harm. The studies had limitations, but, given the concerns over safety, further studies of low-dose aspirin for dementia prevention seem unlikely. If future studies of NSAIDs for dementia prevention are planned, then these will need to be mindful of the safety concerns arising from the studies included in this review and from other studies of the same medicines.",1132,Dementia; inflammation; anti-inflammatory properties; non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); primary prevention; secondary prevention; cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor; celecoxib; naproxen; rofecoxib,What could be the implications of the study's findings on future research into dementia prevention utilizing NSAIDs?,In what ways do the limitations of these studies influence the perceived strength of the evidence regarding NSAIDs' effectiveness in dementia prevention?,Select all of the following that are colors,Identify the primary goal of the study regarding these medications.,Summarize the main finding of the aspirin study in relation to dementia prevention.,Future studies will likely focus on alternative anti-inflammatory agents.; The safety concerns highlighted will necessitate the development of safer NSAID formulations.; There will be an increased interest in combining NSAIDs with other treatments to enhance effectiveness.,Future studies will likely focus on alternative anti-inflammatory agents.; The safety concerns highlighted will necessitate the development of safer NSAID formulations.,The limitations significantly weaken the evidence's reliability.; The limitations bolster confidence in the studies' findings.; The limitations necessitate a nuanced interpretation of the results.,The limitations significantly weaken the evidence's reliability.; The limitations necessitate a nuanced interpretation of the results.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,To observe their effectiveness in delaying or preventing dementia; To cure existing cases of dementia; To discover new side effects,To observe their effectiveness in delaying or preventing dementia,No evidence was found to support the use of aspirin for dementia prevention.; Aspirin was found to effectively prevent dementia.; Aspirin increased the risk of developing dementia.,No evidence was found to support the use of aspirin for dementia prevention.
605fbc12c61d8d10250f6e51,interactive_4,What are the benefits and risks of inhaled bronchodilators in preterm newborns for preventing and treating lung disease?,"Chronic lung disease (CLD) occurs frequently in preterm infants and is associated with respiratory morbidity. Bronchodilators have the potential effect of dilating small airways with muscle hypertrophy. Increased compliance and tidal volume, and decreased airway resistance, have been documented with the use of bronchodilators in infants with CLD. Therefore, bronchodilators are widely considered to have a role in the prevention and treatment of CLD, but there remains uncertainty as to whether they improve clinical outcomes. This is an update of the 2016 Cochrane review. To determine the effect of inhaled bronchodilators given as prophylaxis or as treatment for chronic lung disease (CLD) on mortality and other complications of preterm birth in infants at risk for or identified as having CLD. An Information Specialist searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and three trials registers from 2016 to May 2023. In addition, the review authors undertook reference checking, citation searching and contact with trial authors to identify additional studies. We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials involving preterm infants less than 32 weeks old that compared bronchodilators to no intervention or placebo. CLD was defined as oxygen dependency at 28 days of life or at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age. Initiation of bronchodilator therapy for the prevention of CLD had to occur within two weeks of birth. Treatment of infants with CLD had to be initiated before discharge from the neonatal unit. The intervention had to include administration of a bronchodilator by nebulisation or metered dose inhaler. The comparator was no intervention or placebo. We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Critical outcomes included: mortality within the trial period; CLD (defined as oxygen dependency at 28 days of life or at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age); adverse effects of bronchodilators, including hypokalaemia (low potassium levels in the blood), tachycardia, cardiac arrhythmia, tremor, hypertension and hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar); and pneumothorax. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. We included two randomised controlled trials in this review update. Only one trial provided useable outcome data. This trial was conducted in six neonatal intensive care units in France and Portugal, and involved 173 participants with a gestational age of less than 31 weeks. The infants in the intervention group received salbutamol for the prevention of CLD. The evidence suggests that salbutamol may result in little to no difference in mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50 to 2.31; risk difference (RD) 0.01, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.11; low-certainty evidence) or CLD at 28 days (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.37; RD 0.02, 95% CI -0.13 to 0.17; low-certainty evidence), when compared to placebo. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of salbutamol on pneumothorax. The one trial with usable data reported that there were no relevant differences between groups, without providing the number of events (very low-certainty evidence). Investigators in this study did not report if side effects occurred. We found no eligible trials that evaluated the use of bronchodilator therapy for the treatment of infants with CLD. We identified no ongoing studies. Low-certainty evidence from one trial showed that inhaled bronchodilator prophylaxis may result in little or no difference in the incidence of mortality or CLD in preterm infants, when compared to placebo. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of salbutamol on pneumothorax, and neither included study reported on the incidence of serious adverse effects. We identified no trials that studied the use of bronchodilator therapy for the treatment of CLD. Additional clinical trials are necessary to assess the role of bronchodilator agents in the prophylaxis or treatment of CLD. Researchers studying the effects of inhaled bronchodilators in preterm infants should include relevant clinical outcomes in addition to pulmonary mechanical outcomes.","Newborns born too early, especially those born before 28 weeks of pregnancy, face a higher risk of death, lung disease, and brain impairment than babies born at or near term, and some develop long-term problems such as intellectual disabilities, blindness, or deafness. Chronic lung disease is common among preterm infants who cannot breathe independently and require oxygen or mechanical ventilation. Bronchodilators are medicines that widen the air passages in the lungs and may help open small airways in preterm babies; they are used to treat or potentially prevent chronic lung disease. These medicines can be inhaled, taken by mouth, injected, or delivered through a nebuliser, but they may cause side effects such as low potassium levels, fast or abnormal heart rhythms, tremor, high blood pressure, high sugar levels, or lung collapse. We wanted to find out whether bronchodilators reduce the risk of death or chronic lung disease and whether they increase the risk of unwanted effects, including abnormal heart rhythms, tremor, high blood pressure, high sugar levels, or pneumothorax (collapsed lung). We searched for studies evaluating bronchodilators in preterm infants and summarised the findings, rating our confidence in the evidence based on study design and sample size. Only two studies met the criteria, and one did not report any relevant outcomes. The remaining study involved 173 preterm newborns at risk of chronic lung disease who were treated with salbutamol or placebo. Salbutamol may make little to no difference to the risk of death or chronic lung disease compared with placebo, and its effect on pneumothorax is unclear; in this study it was given at a dose of 200 micrograms every four hours for 28 days. The study did not report any adverse effects of salbutamol, and there are no ongoing studies investigating bronchodilator use in preterm infants.

605fbc12c61d8d10250f6e51,finetuned_5,Is molnupiravir (an antiviral medicine) safe and effective in treating people with COVID-19?,"To assess the effects of molnupiravir in people with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and mild to moderate symptoms. We identified all relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) by searching the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, Science Citation Index Expanded, the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Literature on Coronavirus Disease database, and the COVID Network Meta-Analysis database with no language restrictions up to 26 April 2024. In outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19, molnupiravir 800 mg taken orally every 12 hours for five days probably results in little to no difference in all-cause mortality and may result in little to no difference in rates of hospitalisation and symptom resolution. There is evidence of increased viral clearance by day 5, but the clinical relevance of this finding is unclear. There is probably little to no difference in adverse events, and there is little to no difference in serious adverse events, with molnupiravir versus placebo or standard care. Inpatient data are lacking, and there is no evidence of benefit of molnupiravir in this population. Further research involving inpatients may change this.","Molnupiravir is a pill used to treat COVID-19 in people who are at high risk of developing severe illness. It works by interfering with the ability of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) to reproduce, helping the body to fight off the infection. We wanted to find out how molnupiravir compares to no treatment, placebo (dummy treatment), or standard of care in decreasing death and hospitalisation in people with COVID-19; speeding up recovery (time to symptom resolution); clearing the virus that causes COVID-19 (viral clearance); safety, by looking at all unwanted events and serious unwanted events. We searched for studies that evaluated molnupiravir compared with no treatment, placebo, or standard of care in people with confirmed COVID-19. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods. The types of studies we looked at were randomised controlled trials, which assign people randomly to two or more treatment groups. This is the best way to ensure that study groups are similar, and that investigators and participants don't know who is in which group. The review included 11 studies with 31,272 participants, mostly outpatients (people not admitted to hospital) with mild to moderate COVID-19. When we combined results from studies that recruited outpatients (people not admitted to hospital) with mild to moderate COVID-19, we found the following key results: Molnupiravir probably results in little to no difference in the risk of death. Compared with people receiving placebo or standard of care, between four and 10 fewer people receiving molnupiravir will die within one month for every 10,000 people treated. We considered this reduction clinically insignificant. Molnupiravir may not reduce hospitalisations, meaning it may not prevent people from getting sicker or needing hospital care. There was evidence of increased viral clearance with molnupiravir by day 5, but this effect diminished by day 14, and we are not sure if it makes any real difference for patients. Molnupiravir may have little to no effect on the probability of having no symptoms by day 14 or day 28. Molnupiravir probably results in little to no difference in adverse events, and results in little to no difference in serious adverse events. There are too few data to draw clear conclusions about molnupiravir's effects in people admitted to hospital with severe COVID-19. Most evidence comes from studies conducted in outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19, so the results may not apply to people with severe illness who are hospitalised. The studies provided scarce evidence on long-term outcomes such as quality of life after recovery or how long the virus stays in the body. We were unable to analyse whether molnupiravir had a different effect in certain groups of people, like those with severe pre-existing conditions or people from low- or middle-income countries.",1106,molnupiravir; SARS-CoV-2; mild to moderate COVID-19; all-cause mortality; symptom resolution; viral clearance; clinical relevance; adverse events,What reasoning could justify the conclusion that molnupiravir has little effect on hospitalisations in mild COVID-19 cases?,How might the design of future studies be improved to better assess molnupiravir's effectiveness in severe COVID-19 cases?,Select the items that are animals,What conclusions might be drawn from the evidence of increased viral clearance by day 5 with no significant impact on symptoms?,What challenges could arise in interpreting the clinical relevance of viral clearance associated with molnupiravir?,No significant difference in hospitalisation rates compared to placebo; Possible misinterpretation of viral clearance as recovery; Bias introduced by non-randomized study designs,No significant difference in hospitalisation rates compared to placebo,Including a larger sample of hospitalised patients; Excluding all outpatients to reduce variability; Focusing on participants from higher-income countries,Including a larger sample of hospitalised patients,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,Viral clearance may not correlate directly with clinical outcomes; The study possibly had errors in measuring viral load; Molnupiravir has a durable effect lasting beyond day 5,Viral clearance may not correlate directly with clinical outcomes,Lack of alignment between viral clearance and patient recovery; Overstated results from non-peer-reviewed studies; Underrepresentation of severe cases in the data,Lack of alignment between viral clearance and patient recovery
605fbc12c61d8d10250f6e51,finetuned_6,Interventions to prevent asthma attacks in children upon return to school in the autumn,"Asthma exacerbations in school-aged children peak in autumn shortly after they return to school, likely due to factors such as poor treatment adherence, increased allergen and viral exposure, and changes in immune tolerance. Because this seasonal peak is predictable occurring in September in the Northern Hemisphere and February in the Southern Hemisphere targeted interventions may help reduce exacerbations and lessen the strain on health services. This review assessed the effects of pharmacological and behavioural interventions implemented before school return to reduce autumn asthma exacerbations in children. We searched major trial registries and databases up to 1 December 2017, with no language restrictions. We included randomised controlled trials comparing pre-autumn interventions with usual care in children aged 18 years or younger. Standard Cochrane methods were used for study selection, data extraction, and bias assessment. The primary outcome was the proportion of children experiencing an asthma exacerbation requiring hospitalisation or oral corticosteroids during autumn. Of 546 trials screened, five met the inclusion criteria, enrolling 14,252 children. All studies were conducted in the Northern Hemisphere. Three interventions used leukotriene receptor antagonists, one used omalizumab or an inhaled corticosteroid boost, and the largest study (12,179 children) used a medication reminder letter. Although individual studies generally had low risk of bias, the evidence quality was downgraded due to imprecision, inconsistency, and indirect outcome measurement. Only one US study involving 513 children with asthma and allergic sensitisation reported data for the primary outcome. In this study, exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids or hospitalisation within 90 days of school return were reduced to 11.3% in the omalizumab group compared with 21.0% in the placebo group. The other studies used different exacerbation definitions. A pooled analysis of two leukotriene receptor antagonist trials found no effect on exacerbations, and the reminder-letter intervention did not reduce unscheduled respiratory healthcare contacts between September and December. Four studies reported adverse events, with no evidence of differences between intervention and usual care groups. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were not possible due to insufficient data. Seasonal omalizumab treatment starting four to six weeks before school return may reduce autumn asthma exacerbations, with no increase in adverse effects aside from injection site pain, although the treatment is costly. There was no evidence regarding effects on asthma control, quality of life, or mortality. Future trials should clearly define exacerbations, standardise outcome measures, and carefully characterise participants to allow analysis of subgroup effects.","Asthma is a long-term condition affecting the lungs. It is the most common long-term condition affecting children. One in 11 children in the United Kingdom have asthma. People with asthma can experience asthma 'attacks' of coughing, wheezing, and difficulty breathing. Each year there is a peak in asthma attacks after school restarts in autumn. The likely reason for this is that children are exposed to more viruses that can trigger asthma. Children may also have taken their regular medication less consistently with the break in routine over the summer. As this increase in attacks at the start of the school year is predictable, and the reason for it is somewhat understood, it might be preventable. Approaches to reducing autumn asthma attacks include using extra medications when school restarts or medication reminders during the school holiday. Our searches found 546 trials, of which five were relevant. In total, 14,252 children were randomly assigned to receive either an intervention targeting autumn asthma attacks or usual care. Four small studies (approximately 200 to 1200 children in each) gave children extra asthma medication; these additional medications were omalizumab, leukotriene receptor antagonist tablets, or increased doses of inhaled steroids. One study sent a medication reminder letter over the summer holidays to parents of children with asthma. One trial gave children either omalizumab or placebo. Omalizumab is an antibody designed to alter the immune response. It was given by injection regularly over four to six weeks before school return (i.e. over the bulk of the summer holidays). The children in this study had known allergic asthma. The study showed that omalizumab might reduce autumn attacks. Eleven per cent of those receiving omalizumab had an asthma attack during the first 90 days compared to 21% of those receiving placebo. Three studies used leukotriene receptor antagonist tablets, either montelukast or pranlukast. Although the results of one study suggested that seasonal montelukast might reduce autumn attacks, there was no evidence of reduced attacks in the other two later trials, including a second larger trial of montelukast. There was no evidence that sending a reminder letter reduces the number of children requiring an unplanned healthcare contact. No study provided evidence that the total number of children experiencing adverse events was greater in the intervention than in the usual care group. Our findings were limited by the small numbers of studies identified and because these studies used different interventions and definitions of asthma exacerbations. Further research is needed to better understand how to prevent seasonal attacks, including interventions suitable for children with mild asthma, where expensive and painful treatments are not justified.",1078,asthma exacerbations; allergic sensitisation; leukotriene receptor antagonists; omalizumab; inhaled corticosteroid boost; oral corticosteroids; placebo group; unscheduled respiratory healthcare contacts; adverse events; asthma control,How do the various interventions compare in their effectiveness to reduce autumn asthma attacks?,What was the primary purpose of the study discussed in the summary?,Select all of the following that are fruits,How did the seasonal omalizumab treatment affect asthma exacerbations in the study?,What problem is associated with the increase of asthma attacks in autumn?,Omalizumab proved more effective than leukotriene receptor antagonists.; The medication reminder letter showed the highest reduction in attacks.; All interventions showed equal effectiveness.,Omalizumab proved more effective than leukotriene receptor antagonists.,To assess the effects of pre-autumn interventions on asthma exacerbations in children.; To find new medications for asthma treatment.; To study summer activities of children with asthma.,To assess the effects of pre-autumn interventions on asthma exacerbations in children.,dog; blue; grape,grape,Reduced exacerbations by 11%; Reduced exacerbations to 11% of occurrences; Increased exacerbations by 21%,Reduced exacerbations to 11% of occurrences,Increased contact with triggers such as viruses; Children change their class schedules; Decrease in temperatures leading to cold symptoms,Increased contact with triggers such as viruses
605fbc12c61d8d10250f6e51,finetuned_6,Oral Class I and III antiarrhythmic drugs for maintaining sinus rhythm after catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation,"Recurrence of atrial tachyarrhythmias (ATa) following catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common problem. Antiarrhythmic drugs have been used shortly after ablation in an attempt to maintain sinus rhythm, particularly Class I and III agents. However, it still needs to be established if the use of Class I or III antiarrhythmic medications, or both, reduce the risk of recurrence of ATa.
To assess the effects of oral Class I and III antiarrhythmic drugs versus control (standard medical therapy without Class I or III antiarrhythmics, or placebo) for maintaining sinus rhythm in people undergoing catheter ablation for AF.
We systematically searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science Core Collection, and two clinical trial registers without restrictions on language or date to 5 August 2022.
We sought published, unpublished, and ongoing parallel-design, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving adult participants undergoing ablation for AF, with subsequent comparison of Class I and/or III antiarrhythmic use versus control (standard medical therapy or non-Class I and/or III antiarrhythmic use).
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane and performed meta-analyses with risk ratios (RR) and Peto odds ratios (Peto OR). Our primary outcomes were recurrence of atrial tachyarrhythmias; adverse events: thromboembolic events; adverse events: myocardial infarction; adverse events: new diagnosis of heart failure; and adverse events: requirement for one or more hospitalisations for atrial tachyarrhythmia. Our secondary outcomes were: all-cause mortality; and requirement for one or more repeat ablations. Where possible, we performed comparison analysis by Class I and/or III antiarrhythmic and divided follow-up periods for our primary outcome. We performed comprehensive assessments of risk of bias and certainty of evidence applying the GRADE methodology.
We included nine RCTs involving a total of 3269 participants. Participants were on average 59.3 years old; 71.0% were male; and 72.9% and 27.4% had paroxysmal and persistent AF, respectively. Class I and/or III antiarrhythmics may reduce recurrence of ATa at 0 to 3 months postablation (risk ratio (RR) 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 0.94, 8 trials, 3046 participants, low-certainty evidence) and likely reduce recurrence at > 3 to 6 months, our a priori primary time point (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.93, 5 trials, 2591 participants, moderate-certainty evidence). Beyond six months the evidence is very uncertain, and the benefit of antiarrhythmics may not persist (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.55, 4 trials, 2244 participants, very low-certainty evidence). The evidence suggests that Class I and/or III antiarrhythmics may not increase the risk of thromboembolic events, myocardial infarction, all-cause mortality, or requirement for repeat ablation, at 0 to 3, > 3 to 6, and > 6 months (where data were available; low- to very low-certainty evidence). The use of Class I and/or III antiarrhythmics postablation likely reduces hospitalisations for ATa by approximately 57% at 0 to 3 months (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.64, moderate-certainty evidence). No data were available beyond three months. No data were available on new diagnoses of heart failure. Fewer data were available for Class I and III antiarrhythmics individually. Based on only one and two trials (n = 125 to 309), Class I antiarrhythmics may have little effect on recurrence of ATa at 0 to 3, > 3 to 6, and > 6 months (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.20, 2 trials, 309 participants; RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.19, 1 trial, 125 participants; RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.32, 1 trial, 125 participants; low-certainty evidence throughout); requirement for hospitalisation for ATa at 0 to 3 months (low-certainty evidence); or requirement for repeat ablation at 0 to 3 months (low-certainty evidence). No data were available for thromboembolic events, myocardial infarction, new diagnosis of heart failure, or all-cause mortality at any time points, or hospitalisation or repeat ablation beyond three months. Class III antiarrhythmics may have little effect on recurrence of ATa at up to 3 months and at > 3 to 6 months (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.16, 4 trials, 599 participants, low-certainty evidence; RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.09, 2 trials, 318 participants, low-certainty evidence), and beyond 6 months one trial reported a possible increase in recurrence of ATa (RR 1.95, 95% CI 1.29 to 2.94, 1 trial, 112 participants, low-certainty evidence). Class III antiarrhythmics likely reduce hospitalisations for ATa at 0 to 3 months (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.63, moderate-certainty evidence), and may have little effect on all-cause mortality (low- to very low-certainty evidence). The effect of Class III antiarrhythmics on thromboembolic events and requirement for repeat ablation was uncertain (very low-certainty evidence for both outcomes). No data were available for myocardial infarction or new diagnosis of heart failure at any time point, outcomes other than recurrence beyond 6 months, or for hospitalisation and repeat ablation > 3 to 6 months. We assessed the majority of included trials as at low or unclear risk of bias. One trial reported an error in the randomisation process, raising the potential risk of selection bias; most of the included trials were non-blinded; and two trials were at high risk of attrition bias.
We found evidence to suggest that the use of Class I and/or III antiarrhythmics up to 3 months after ablation is associated with a reduced recurrence of ATa 0 to 6 months after ablation, which may not persist beyond 6 months, and an immediate reduction in hospitalisation for ATa 0 to 3 months after ablation. The evidence suggests there is no difference in rates of all-cause mortality, thromboembolic events, or myocardial infarction between Class I and/or III antiarrhythmics versus control.","We wanted to find out how effective certain classes of antiarrhythmic drugs (medications used to prevent or treat an irregular heart rhythm) are for maintaining sinus rhythm (normal heart rhythm) in people after catheter ablation (a technique using catheters to create controlled burns in the heart to prevent and treat arrhythmia occurrence) for atrial fibrillation (a common type of irregular heart rhythm), compared to catheter ablation alone.
The most common abnormal heart rhythm, atrial fibrillation can cause the upper two chambers of the heart (atria) to beat very rapidly leading to symptoms such as palpitations, dizziness, and shortness of breath. Treatment of atrial fibrillation typically includes medications to control the heart rate and reduce the risk of stroke. However, in some people, restoring the normal heart rhythm to control symptoms is achieved by creating controlled burns with ablation catheters to eliminate atrial fibrillation. Patients often revert back to atrial fibrillation despite ablation, and certain antiarrhythmic drugs (of which we were only interested in Class I and III) are given to reduce the risk of recurrence of arrhythmia.
We performed a thorough search of databases for all trials including atrial fibrillation and all individual Class I and Class III antiarrhythmic drugs including, for example, flecainide, propafenone, amiodarone, dronedarone, and sotalol.
We conducted the search on 5 August 2022, and identified 4682 citations (papers), out of which nine were eligible randomised controlled trials (a type of study where people are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups). The studies included a total of 3269 participants from six countries, who were assigned to either Class I or III antiarrhythmics (or both) or placebo (sugar pill)/standard treatment. People taking part in the studies were on average 59 years old, and 71% were male. Most people had paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (meaning they were not in atrial fibrillation all the time and alternated with normal rhythms).
We found that the effect of Class I and/or III antiarrhythmic drugs given up to around 3 months after ablation may reduce recurrence of arrhythmia at 0 to 3 months, and likely reduces recurrence at greater than 3 to 6 months, although the benefit does not appear to continue beyond 6 months (the evidence for this last result was very uncertain). We also looked at adverse outcomes (i.e. complications). We found that the use of antiarrhythmics was probably associated with a reduction in hospitalisation at 0 to 3 months. We also found evidence suggesting that antiarrhythmics are not associated with different rates of thromboembolic events (clots in the brain, lungs, or legs), heart attacks, death due to any cause, or requirement for repeat ablation compared with control or standard treatment.
Our confidence in the evidence was low for recurrence of arrhythmias at 0 to 3 months, moderate at 3 to 6 months, and very low at greater than 6 months. Our confidence in the evidence for reduction of hospitalisation for arrhythmias was moderate.",1041,catheter ablation; atrial fibrillation; atrial tachyarrhythmias; sinus rhythm; Class I antiarrhythmics; Class III antiarrhythmics; thromboembolic events; myocardial infarction; heart failure; paroxysmal and persistent AF,What rationale does the study provide to evaluate the continued use of Class I and III antiarrhythmic drugs beyond six months post-ablation?,What is the main purpose of using Class I and III antiarrhythmic drugs post-ablation?,Select all of the following that are fruits,What adverse outcomes were considered in the study?,"According to the study, what effect do Class I and III antiarrhythmics have on hospitalization for arrhythmias at 0 to 3 months?","The study suggests uncertainty about continued benefits of these drugs beyond six months.; The study confirms a strong continued benefit of these drugs beyond six months.; The study provides no data on post-six-month use, making evaluation impossible.",The study suggests uncertainty about continued benefits of these drugs beyond six months.,To reduce recurrence of arrhythmia; To increase heart rate; To cause new arrhythmias,To reduce recurrence of arrhythmia,dog; blue; grape,grape,Heart attacks and thromboembolic events; Kidney failure and diabetes; High blood pressure and obesity,Heart attacks and thromboembolic events,Increase hospitalization; Reduce hospitalization; No effect on hospitalization,Reduce hospitalization
674c8549a9fd90b7c8dda9d3,static_1,Drugs for preventing lung cancer in healthy people,"This is the second update of this Cochrane Review. Some studies have suggested a protective effect of antioxidant nutrients and higher dietary levels of fruits and vegetables on lung cancer. To determine whether vitamins and minerals and other potential agents, alone or in combination, reduce lung cancer incidence and lung cancer mortality in healthy populations. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase from 1974 to May 2019 and screened references included in published studies and reviews. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing vitamins or mineral supplements with placebo, administered to healthy people with the aim of preventing lung cancer. Four review authors independently selected the trials to be included in the review, assessed their methodological quality and extracted data. For dichotomous outcomes we calculated risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and pooled results using the random-effects model. We assessed the risk of bias using Cochrane's 'Risk of bias' assessment tool and certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. In this update, we identified three new trials for a total of 12 studies. Six analysed vitamin A, three vitamin C, three combined vitamin D3 + calcium, four vitamin E combined with other products, one selenium supplements and nine studied combinations of two or more products. Four studies included only men and five only women. Vitamin A results in little to no difference in lung cancer incidence (RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.19; 5 RCTs, 212314 participants; high-certainty evidence) and lung cancer mortality (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.38; 3 RCTs, 190118 participants; high-certainty evidence). But in smokers or asbestos workers vitamin A increases the risk of lung cancer incidence (RR 1.10, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.20; 3 RCTs, 43995 participants; high-certainty evidence), lung cancer mortality (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.38; 2 RCTs, 29426 participants; high-certainty evidence) and all-cause mortality (RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.13; 2 RCTs, 32883 participants; high-certainty evidence). Vitamin A increases the risk of minor side effects, such as yellowing of the skin and minor gastrointestinal symptoms (high-certainty evidence). Vitamin C likely results in little to no difference in lung cancer incidence (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.49; 2 RCTs, 14953 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). In women, vitamin C increases the risk of lung cancer incidence (RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.95; 1 RCT, 7627 participants; high-certainty evidence). In men, vitamin C results in little to no difference in mortality for lung cancer (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.23; 1 RCT, 7326 participants; high-certainty evidence). Vitamin D + calcium may result in little to no difference in lung cancer incidence in postmenopausal women (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.39 to 2.08; 3 RCTs, 37601 women; low-certainty evidence). Vitamin E results in little to no difference in lung cancer incidence (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.14; 3 RCTs, 36841 participants; high-certainty evidence) or to lung cancer mortality (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.18; 2 RCTs, 29214 participants; high-certainty evidence), but increases the risk of haemorrhagic strokes (hazard ratio (HR), 1.74, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.91; 1 RCT, 14641 participants; high-certainty evidence). Calcium results in little to no difference in lung cancer incidence in postmenopausal women (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.13 to 3.18; 1 RCT, 733 participants) or in risk of renal calculi (RR 1.94, 95% CI 0.20 to 18.57; 1 RCT, 733 participants; low-certainty evidence). Selenium in men results in little to no difference in lung cancer incidence (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.54; 1 RCT, 17448 participants; high-certainty evidence) and lung cancer mortality (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.66; 1 RCT, 17448 participants; high-certainty evidence) and increases the risk for grade 1 to 2 dermatitis (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.31; 1 RCT, 17448 participants; high-certainty evidence) and for alopecia (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.53; 1 RCT, 17448 participants; high-certainty evidence). The combination of vitamins A, C, E + selenium + zinc results in little to no difference in lung cancer incidence (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.48; 1 RCT, 12741 participants; high-certainty evidence). Well-designed RCTs have shown no beneficial effect of supplements for the prevention of lung cancer and lung cancer mortality in healthy people. Vitamin A supplements increase lung cancer incidence and mortality in smokers or persons exposed to asbestos. Vitamin C increases lung cancer incidence in women. Vitamin E increases the risk of haemorrhagic strokes.","We reviewed the evidence assessing the relationship between vitamins or antioxidant intake and lung cancer prevention, mortality and adverse events for that cancer. This review updates our Cochrane Review on this topic published in 2012. Lung cancer is among the leading causes of cancer death throughout the world, and its prevention has become a public health priority. It has been suggested that vitamin supplements and some antioxidants may prevent lung cancer. This review includes 12 studies in which healthy adults were randomly assigned to receive vitamin supplements or placebo (a substance that has no physical effects) and were followed over time to evaluate their risk of developing lung cancer. The evidence is current to May 2019. None of the treatments compared with placebo have shown a difference in the risk for lung cancer incidence or lung cancer mortality in healthy people. In smokers and people exposed to asbestos, vitamin A increases lung cancer incidence, lung cancer mortality and all-cause mortality. Vitamin C increases lung cancer incidence in women. Vitamin E increases the risk of haemorrhagic strokes.

674c8549a9fd90b7c8dda9d3,static_2,Is plasma from the blood of people who have recovered from COVID-19 an effective treatment for other people with COVID-19?,"Convalescent plasma may reduce mortality in patients with viral respiratory diseases, and is being investigated as a potential therapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A thorough understanding of the current body of evidence regarding benefits and risks of this intervention is required. To assess the effectiveness and safety of convalescent plasma transfusion in the treatment of people with COVID-19; and to maintain the currency of the evidence using a living systematic review approach. To identify completed and ongoing studies, we searched the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease Research Database, MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, and the Epistemonikos COVID-19 L*OVE Platform. We searched monthly until 03 March 2022. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating convalescent plasma for COVID-19, irrespective of disease severity, age, gender or ethnicity. We excluded studies that included populations with other coronavirus diseases (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)), as well as studies evaluating standard immunoglobulin. We followed standard Cochrane methodology. To assess bias in included studies we used RoB 2. We used the GRADE approach to rate the certainty of evidence for the following outcomes: all-cause mortality at up to day 28, worsening and improvement of clinical status (for individuals with moderate to severe disease), hospital admission or death, COVID-19 symptoms resolution (for individuals with mild disease), quality of life, grade 3 or 4 adverse events, and serious adverse events. In this fourth review update version, we included 33RCTs with 24,861 participants, of whom 11,432 received convalescent plasma. Of these, nine studies are single-centre studies and 24 are multi-centre studies. Fourteen studies took place in America, eight in Europe, three in South-East Asia, two in Africa, two in western Pacific and three in eastern Mediterranean regions and one in multiple regions. We identified a further 49 ongoingstudies evaluating convalescent plasma, and 33 studies reporting as being completed. Individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and moderate to severe disease 29 RCTs investigated the use of convalescent plasma for 22,728 participants with moderate to severe disease. 23 RCTs with 22,020 participants compared convalescent plasma to placebo or standard care alone, five compared to standard plasma and one compared to human immunoglobulin. We evaluate subgroups on detection of antibodies detection, symptom onset, country income groups and several co-morbidities in the full text. Convalescent plasma versus placebo or standard care alone Convalescent plasma does not reduce all-cause mortality at up to day 28 (risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92 to 1.03; 220 per 1000; 21 RCTs, 19,021 participants; high-certainty evidence). It has little to no impact on need for invasive mechanical ventilation, or death (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.11; 296 per 1000; 6 RCTs, 14,477 participants; high-certainty evidence) and has no impact on whether participants are discharged from hospital (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.02; 665 per 1000; 6 RCTs, 12,721 participants; high-certainty evidence). Convalescent plasma may have little to no impact on quality of life (MD 1.00, 95% CI ÃÆÃÆÃâÃÂ¢ÃÆÃâÃâÃËÃÆÃâÃâÃâ2.14 to 4.14; 1 RCT, 483 participants; low-certainty evidence). Convalescent plasma may have little to no impact on the risk of grades 3 and 4 adverse events (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.42; 212 per 1000; 6 RCTs, 2392 participants; low-certainty evidence). It has probably little to no effect on the risk of serious adverse events (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.44; 135 per 1000; 6 RCTs, 3901 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Convalescent plasma versus standard plasma We are uncertain whether convalescent plasma reduces or increases all-cause mortality at up to day 28 (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.19; 129 per 1000; 4 RCTs, 484 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether convalescent plasma reduces or increases the need for invasive mechanical ventilation, or death (RR 5.59, 95% CI 0.29 to 108.38; 311 per 1000; 1 study, 34 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and whether it reduces or increases the risk of serious adverse events (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.15; 236 per 1000; 3 RCTs, 327 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We did not identify any study reporting other key outcomes. Convalescent plasma versus human immunoglobulin Convalescent plasma may have little to no effect on all-cause mortality at up to day 28 (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.50; 464 per 1000; 1 study, 190 participants; low-certainty evidence). We did not identify any study reporting other key outcomes. Individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and mild disease We identified two RCTs reporting on 536 participants, comparing convalescent plasma to placebo or standard care alone, and two RCTs reporting on 1597 participants with mild disease, comparing convalescent plasma to standard plasma. Convalescent plasma versus placebo or standard care alone We are uncertain whether convalescent plasma reduces all-cause mortality at up to day 28 (odds ratio (OR) 0.36, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.46; 8 per 1000; 2 RCTs, 536 participants; very low-certainty evidence). It may have little to no effect on admission to hospital or death within 28 days (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.84; 117 per 1000; 1 RCT, 376 participants; low-certainty evidence), on time to COVID-19 symptom resolution (hazard ratio (HR) 1.05, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.30; 483 per 1000; 1 RCT, 376 participants; low-certainty evidence), on the risk of grades 3 and 4 adverse events (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.75 to 2.19; 144 per 1000; 1 RCT, 376 participants; low-certainty evidence) and the risk of serious adverse events (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.94; 133 per 1000; 1 RCT, 376 participants; low-certainty evidence). We did not identify any study reporting other key outcomes. Convalescent plasma versus standard plasma We are uncertain whether convalescent plasma reduces all-cause mortality at up to day 28 (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.75; 2 per 1000; 2 RCTs, 1597 participants; very low-certainty evidence). It probably reduces admission to hospital or death within 28 days (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.75; 36 per 1000; 2 RCTs, 1595 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Convalescent plasma may have little to no effect on initial symptom resolution at up to day 28 (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.27; 1 RCT, 416 participants; low-certainty evidence). We did not identify any study reporting other key outcomes. This is a living systematic review. We search monthly for new evidence and update the review when we identify relevant new evidence. For the comparison of convalescent plasma versus placebo or standard care alone, our certainty in the evidence that convalescent plasma for individuals with moderate to severe disease does not reduce mortality and has little to no impact on clinical improvement or worsening is high. It probably has little to no effect on SAEs. For individuals with mild disease, we have very-low to low certainty evidence for most primary outcomes and moderate certainty for hospital admission or death. There are 49 ongoing studies, and 33 studies reported as complete in a trials registry. Publication of ongoing studies might resolve some of the uncertainties around convalescent plasma therapy for people with asymptomatic or mild disease.","Convalescent plasma is plasma containing antibodies produced by the body as a defence against infection, taken from people who have recovered from COVID-19 and used to make treatment that can be given by a drip or injection; while generally well-tolerated, it can cause unwanted effects. We wanted to find out whether convalescent plasma is an effective treatment for people with confirmed COVID-19, looking at deaths from any cause after treatment, worsening of patients' condition measured by the number of people needing ventilator support or who died, improvement measured by hospital discharge, quality of life, and unwanted effects. We searched for studies worldwide that investigated convalescent plasma in people of any age, gender, ethnicity, and with mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19, pooled results when possible, and rated our confidence based on study methods and sizes. We found 33 studies with 24,861 participants, including 29 studies in moderate to severe COVID-19 and four in mild disease, mostly conducted in hospitals worldwide; the findings compare convalescent plasma with placebo or standard care. For people with moderate to severe COVID-19, convalescent plasma makes no difference to deaths within 28 days (about 225 in 1000 died vs 220 in 1000 given plasma), makes little to no difference in needing invasive mechanical ventilation or dying (287 in 1000 vs 296 in 1000), and makes no difference to being discharged from hospital (665 in 1000 in both groups). It probably makes no difference to serious unwanted effects (118 in 1000 vs 133 in 1000) and may result in no difference in quality of life. For people with mild COVID-19, convalescent plasma may result in no difference in deaths within 28 days (22 in 1000 on placebo/standard care vs 9 in 1000 on plasma), may result in no difference in admission to hospital or death within 28 days (112 in 1000 vs 117 in 1000), may result in no difference in the time until symptoms resolved, and may result in no difference in serious unwanted effects. The limitations of the evidence are that we are very confident in the evidence for deaths, worsening, and improvement in moderate to severe COVID-19 due to consistent high-quality studies, but confidence in other evidence for moderate, severe, and mild COVID-19 is limited because we could not identify enough consistent results; there is still little evidence on quality of life and for people with mild disease, and none for those without COVID-19 symptoms.",1108,Convalescent plasma; viral respiratory diseases; coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS); Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS); RoB 2; mechanical ventilation; quality of life; human immunoglobulin; SARS-CoV-2 infection,What inference can be drawn about the impact of convalescent plasma on deaths within 28 days for patients with moderate to severe COVID-19?,What is the estimated effectiveness of convalescent plasma in improving the quality of life for patients with moderate to severe COVID-19?,Select all of the following that are colors,What conclusion can be drawn about the unwanted effects of convalescent plasma therapy for moderate to severe COVID-19?,What hypothesis could be formulated for further studies to resolve uncertainties about convalescent plasma in asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 cases?,"Convalescent plasma significantly reduces mortality.; Convalescent plasma has no impact on mortality compared to placebo or standard care.; The evidence shows mixed results, making it inconclusive.",Convalescent plasma has no impact on mortality compared to placebo or standard care.,The plasma significantly improves quality of life.; There is little to no difference in quality of life compared to standard care.; The evidence on quality of life was robust and conclusive.,There is little to no difference in quality of life compared to standard care.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Convalescent plasma likely increases serious unwanted effects.; The therapy probably makes no difference in the occurrence of serious unwanted effects.; The therapy has a clear difference in reducing unwanted effects.,The therapy probably makes no difference in the occurrence of serious unwanted effects.,Convalescent plasma significantly enhances symptom resolution.; Further large-scale studies will clarify its impact on mild cases.; More randomised trials are unnecessary based on current evidence.,Further large-scale studies will clarify its impact on mild cases.
674c8549a9fd90b7c8dda9d3,static_2,What are the benefits and harms of remote ischaemic conditioning (briefly restricting then restoring blood flow) for preventing and treating stroke?,"Remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) has been developed as a neuroprotective strategy to prevent and treat ischaemic stroke. It usually involves restricting blood flow to limbs and then releasing the ischaemic blood to promote a neuroprotective effect. Preclinical studies have suggested that RIC may have beneficial effects in ischaemic stroke patients and those at risk of ischaemic stroke. However, existing evidence is insufficient to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of RIC in preventing and treating ischaemic stroke. To evaluate the benefits and harms of remote ischaemic conditioning in preventing and treating ischaemic stroke compared to sham or standard treatments. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, three Chinese databases, five trials registers, and conference proceedings, together with reference checking and citation searching. The latest search date was 11 March 2025. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing RIC with sham RIC or medical management in people with ischaemic stroke or at risk of ischaemic stroke. Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed trial quality and risk of bias, and extracted data. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence. We included seven trials, involving 735 participants, in this review. We analysed the effects of RIC on preventing and treating ischaemic stroke respectively. We evaluated risk of bias and judged it to be low for generation of allocation sequence in six studies and unclear in one study; unclear for allocation concealment in four studies and low in three studies; high for incomplete outcome data (attrition bias) in five studies and low in two studies; high for blinding in three studies and low in four studies; low for selective reporting; and high for other sources of bias in six studies and low in one study. We included three trials (involving 371 participants) in the analysis of the effects of RIC on ischaemic stroke prevention. In people with symptomatic intracerebral artery stenosis, recurrent stroke was significantly reduced by RIC (risk ratio (RR) 0.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12 to 0.83; 2 trials, 182 participants, low-quality evidence). In people with carotid stenosis undergoing carotid stenting, there was no significant difference in the incidence of ischaemic stroke between participants treated with RIC and non-RIC (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.03; 1 trial, 189 participants, low-quality evidence); however the stroke severity (assessed by infarct volume) was significantly lower in participants treated with RIC (mean difference (MD) -0.17 mL, 95% CI -0.23 to -0.11; 1 trial, 189 participants, low-quality evidence). Adverse events associated with RIC were significantly higher in participants treated with RIC (RR 10.91; 95% CI 2.01 to 59.28; 3 trials, 371 participants, low-quality evidence), but no severe adverse event was attributable to RIC treatment. No participants experienced death or cardiovascular events during the period of the studies; and no trial reported haemorrhagic stroke or improvement in neurological, phycological or cognitive impairment. We included four trials (involving 364 participants) in the analysis of the effects of RIC on ischaemic stroke treatment. In acute ischaemic stroke, for people receiving intravenous thrombolysis, the rate of death or dependency was significantly increased by RIC treatment compared with non-RIC treatment (RR 2.34; 95% 1.19 to 4.61; 1 trial, 285 participants, low-quality evidence). In people with acute ischaemic stroke, there was no significant difference between RIC and non-RIC for reducing stroke severity as assessed by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score and the final infarct volume (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.24 mL, 95% CI -1.02 to 0.54; 2 trials, 175 participants, very low quality evidence). There was no significant difference between RIC and non-RIC for improving the psychological impairment (SMD -0.37 points, 95% CI -1.15 to 0.41; 1 trial, 26 participants, very low quality evidence) and the cognitive impairment (SMD -0.26 points; 95% CI -0.72 to 0.21; 3 trials, 79 participants, low-quality evidence) in people with acute ischaemic stroke and cerebral small vessel disease. No trial reported ischaemic stroke, recurrent ischaemic stroke, improvement in neurological impairment, hemorrhagic stroke, cardiovascular events, and RIC associated adverse events. There is moderate-certainty evidence that RIC compared to non-RIC probably reduces recurrence of ischaemic stroke slightly, and low-certainty evidence that RIC may result in a slight increase in excellent functional outcome (mRS 0 to 1). Evidence for improvement in NIHSS scores is very uncertain due to risk of bias and imprecision. RIC demonstrated an acceptable harm profile with no increase in intracerebral haemorrhage or mortality; however, treatment-related adverse events were more common. The certainty of evidence was limited by high risk of bias for blinding in most studies, incomplete outcome data in some studies, and imprecision in several outcomes. However, the generalisability of these findings may be limited because 79.3% of participants were from China, highlighting the need for further studies in diverse populations to confirm the results. The optimal timing, duration, and method of RIC administration require further investigation through large, high-quality randomised trials with standardised protocols to establish definitive evidence for clinical practice. This updated analysis includes 16 new RCTs, and these findings highlight the need for ongoing research and careful consideration of study design and methodology in future investigations.","Ischaemic stroke is the most common type of stroke. It occurs when a blood clot blocks an artery that supplies blood to the brain. This blockage cuts off the supply of oxygen and nutrients to a part of the brain. Without this blood supply, brain cells in that area are damaged and begin to die. Remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) involves briefly and repeatedly restricting and then restoring blood flow in a limb (an arm or leg) with a blood pressure cuff. The goal is to ""condition"" the limb and trigger the body's natural defences to protect other organs. Studies have found that for people who have had a stroke and are receiving standard medical care, adding RIC can reduce the amount of brain tissue damaged by the stroke, improve recovery of everyday functions, help prevent another stroke from happening, and reduce problems with memory and thinking.
We wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of RIC in people who have had an ischaemic stroke and are undergoing various treatments, including standard medical therapy, intravenous thrombolysis (a clot-dissolving treatment), or mechanical thrombectomy (a procedure to remove clots). Specifically, we wanted to know if RIC was better than sham or standard treatment for improving:
- the risk of dying;
- the risk of having another stroke;
- the likelihood of an excellent recovery (a score on the Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) of 0 to 1);
- the likelihood of being able to live independently (mRS score of 0 to 2);
- the risk of a brain bleed;
- brain function issues;
- the risk of major heart problems.
We also wanted to know if RIC has unwanted effects.
We searched for studies that compared the benefits and harms of remote ischaemic conditioning in people with ischaemic stroke. We then compared and summarised the study results and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and sample sizes.
We found 21 studies with 7687 people. The studies took place in China, Denmark, France, the UK, and Romania, and were published between 2012 and 2025.
Sixteen studies including 6828 participants suggested that RIC compared to sham or no treatment probably leads to a slight reduction in the risk of having another stroke. About half the studies measured participants' level of independence using the mRS and measured change in brain function issues using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). RIC might lead to a slight increase in the number of people achieving an excellent recovery, but may have little or no effect on the number of people being able to live independently. In addition, RIC might result in a slight improvement in brain function issues, but the evidence is very uncertain. There may be little or no difference between RIC and sham or standard treatment in the risk of a brain bleed and major heart problems, and RIC probably does not increase the risk of death. However, RIC may have unwanted effects such as arm pain, redness, or swelling.
We also identified 21 ongoing studies that we plan to add to the next version of our review.
Our confidence in the evidence is moderate to very low for several reasons. Most studies had few participants, and more than half of studies were done in China, which means the results of our review may not apply to people in other parts of the world. Some studies included people who received clot-dissolving treatment (thrombolysis) and people who did not, and we could not separate the results for these two groups. This mix of patients may have affected our overall analysis. Finally, we did not separate the results in our analysis based on the type of comparison group used (sham or standard treatment). This means it is difficult to know if the treatment effect we found was influenced by the type of comparison.",1069,Ischaemic stroke; Remote ischaemic conditioning; Neuroprotective effect; Symptomatic intracerebral artery stenosis; Carotid stenosis; Intravenous thrombolysis; Infarct volume; National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale; Carotid stenting,What is the primary goal of remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) mentioned in the summary?,What effects of RIC on brain function issues were summarized?,Select the items that are animals,How does RIC compare to sham or standard treatment in terms of stroke recurrence risk?,What was evaluated alongside the benefits of RIC in the summary?,To dissolve existing blood clots in the brain.; To trigger the body's natural defenses to protect other organs.; To permanently restrict blood flow to limbs.,To trigger the body's natural defenses to protect other organs.,RIC might result in a slight improvement in brain function issues.; RIC causes significant decline in cognitive function.; RIC has no impact on brain function issues.,RIC might result in a slight improvement in brain function issues.,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,RIC probably leads to a slight reduction in the risk of having another stroke.; RIC significantly increases the risk of recurrent stroke.; RIC has no effect on stroke recurrence risk.,RIC probably leads to a slight reduction in the risk of having another stroke.,The harms of RIC were also evaluated.; Only the economic cost of RIC was evaluated.; RIC's compatibility with other conditions was evaluated.,The harms of RIC were also evaluated.
674c8549a9fd90b7c8dda9d3,interactive_3,Medicines to prevent breast cancer in women at above-average risk of developing breast cancer,"Breast cancer is the most frequently occurring malignancy and the second cause of death for cancer in women. Cancer prevention agents (CPAs) are a promising approach to reduce the burden of breast cancer. Currently, two main types of CPAs are available: selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs, such as tamoxifen and raloxifene) and aromatase inhibitors (AIs, such as exemestane and anastrozole).
To assess the efficacy and acceptability of single CPAs for the prevention of primary breast cancer, in unaffected women, at an above-average risk of developing breast cancer. Using a network meta-analysis, to rank single CPAs, based on their efficacy and acceptability (an endpoint that is defined as the inverse of CPA-related toxicity).
We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), and ClinicalTrials.gov on 17 August 2018. We handsearched reference lists to identify additional relevant studies.
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that enrolled women without a personal history of breast cancer but with an above-average risk of developing a tumor. Women had to be treated with a CPA and followed up to record the occurrence of breast cancer and adverse events.
Two review authors independently extracted data and conducted risk of bias assessments of the included studies, and assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. Outcome data included incidence of breast carcinoma (both invasive and in situ carcinoma) and adverse events (both overall and severe toxicity). We performed a conventional meta-analysis (for direct comparisons of a single CPA with placebo or a different CPA) and network meta-analysis (for indirect comparisons).
We included six studies enrolling 50,927 women randomized to receive one CPA (SERMs: tamoxifen or raloxifene, or AIs: exemestane or anastrozole) or placebo. Three studies compared tamoxifen and placebo, two studies compared AIs (exemestane or anastrozole) versus placebo, and one study compared tamoxifen versus raloxifene. The risk of bias was low for all RCTs. For the tamoxifen versus placebo comparison, tamoxifen likely resulted in a lower risk of developing breast cancer compared to placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 0.76; 3 studies, 22,832 women; moderate-certainty evidence). In terms of adverse events, tamoxifen likely increased the risk of severe toxicity compared to placebo (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.47; 2 studies, 20,361 women; moderate-certainty evidence). In particular, women randomized to receive tamoxifen experienced a higher incidence of both endometrial carcinoma (RR 2.26, 95% CI 1.52 to 3.38; high-certainty evidence) and thromboembolism (RR 2.10, 95% CI 1.14 to 3.89; high-certainty evidence) compared to women who received placebo. For the AIs versus placebo comparison, AIs (exemestane or anastrozole) reduced the risk of breast cancer by 53% (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.63; 2 studies, 8424 women; high-certainty evidence). In terms of adverse events, AIs increased the risk of severe toxicity by 18% (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.28; 2 studies, 8352 women; high-certainty evidence). These differences were sustained especially by endocrine (e.g. hot flashes), gastrointestinal (e.g. diarrhea), and musculoskeletal (e.g. arthralgia) adverse events, while there were no differences in endometrial cancer or thromboembolism rates between AIs and placebo. For the tamoxifen versus raloxifene comparison, raloxifene probably performed worse than tamoxifen in terms of breast cancer incidence reduction (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.43; 1 study, 19,490 women; moderate-certainty evidence), but its use was associated with lower toxicity rates (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.95; 1 study, 19,490 women; moderate-certainty evidence), particularly relating to incidence of endometrial cancer and thromboembolism. An indirect comparison of treatment effects allowed us to compare the SERMs and AIs in this review. In terms of efficacy, AIs (exemestane or anastrozole) may have reduced breast cancer incidence slightly compared to tamoxifen (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.98; 5 RCTs, 31,256 women); however, the certainty of evidence was low. A lack of model convergence did not allow us to analyze toxicity data.
For women with an above-average risk of developing breast cancer, CPAs can reduce the incidence of this disease. AIs appear to be more effective than SERMs (tamoxifen) in reducing the risk of developing breast cancer. AIs are not associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer and thromboembolic events. However, long-term data on toxicities from tamoxifen are available while the follow-up toxicity data on unaffected women taking AIs is relatively short. Additional data from direct comparisons are needed to fully address the issues of breast cancer prevention by risk-reducing medications, with special regards to acceptability (i.e. the benefit/harm ratio).","Breast cancer is the most frequent type of cancer and the second cause of death by cancer in women. Therefore, any strategy which can reduce its burden is eagerly awaited. Cancer prevention agents (CPAs) are medicines that might fulfil this need. Currently, two main types of CPAs are available to combat breast cancer: selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs, such as tamoxifen and raloxifene) and aromatase inhibitors (such as exemestane and anastrozole). Women without personal history of breast cancer, but with above-average risk of developing this disease (that is, with a lifetime risk greater than 17%) represent the usual target population for CPAs.
This Cochrane Review aimed to summarize the evidence on the efficacy and toxicity of CPAs for the prevention of primary breast cancer.
The review authors found six studies enrolling 50,927 women to receive one CPA or placebo (a pretend treatment, e.g. a sugar pill). Three studies involving 23,013 women compared tamoxifen and placebo, two studies involving 8424 women compared aromatase inhibitors (exemestane or anastrozole) and placebo, and one study involving 19,490 women that compared tamoxifen and raloxifene.
Based on the three studies that compared tamoxifen to placebo, tamoxifen probably reduced the risk of developing breast cancer by 32% compared to placebo. However, tamoxifen was associated with a 28% increased risk of severe side effects compared to placebo based on two studies involving 20,361 women. In particular, women taking tamoxifen experienced higher incidence of endometrial cancer and thromboembolism than women having no medicine.
For women who received either an aromatase inhibitor (exemestane or anastrozole) or placebo, aromatase inhibitors reduced the risk of breast cancer by 53% compared to placebo. Data from two studies involving 8352 women indicated that aromatase inhibitors increased the risk of severe side effects by 18% compared to placebo. These differences were sustained especially by endocrine (hormonal; e.g. hot flashes), gastrointestinal (e.g. diarrhea), and musculoskeletal (e.g. joint pain) side effects, whereas there were no differences in either endometrial cancer or thromboembolism rates.
For women who received either tamoxifen or raloxifene, raloxifene probably performed worse than tamoxifen in terms of breast cancer incidence reduction, but its use was associated with a 13% reduction of toxicity rates especially endometrial cancer and thromboembolism.
A specialized method named a 'network meta-analysis' allowed us to compare medications never directly compared to each other in a study. Based on this network meta-analysis, aromatase inhibitors may have led to a 23% additional risk reduction of developing breast cancer compared to tamoxifen. However, the reliability of the evidence was low meaning that further research is likely to have an impact on our confidence in this result.

674c8549a9fd90b7c8dda9d3,interactive_4,Collaborative care for people with depression and anxiety,"Common mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety, are estimated to affect up to 15% of the UK population at any one time, and health care systems worldwide need to implement interventions to reduce the impact and burden of these conditions; collaborative care is a complex intervention based on chronic disease management models that may be effective in the management of these common mental health problems. To assess the effectiveness of collaborative care for patients with depression or anxiety, we searched databases to February 2012, including The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group (CCDAN) trials registers (CCDANCTR-References and CCDANCTR-Studies) which include relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from MEDLINE (1950 to present), EMBASE (1974 to present), PsycINFO (1967 to present) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, all years), as well as the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal (ICTRP), ClinicalTrials.gov, and CINAHL (to November 2010 only), and we screened the reference lists of reports of all included studies and published systematic reviews for reports of additional studies. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of collaborative care for participants of all ages with depression or anxiety were included; two independent researchers extracted data using a standardised data extraction sheet, made 'Risk of bias' assessments using criteria from The Cochrane Collaboration, combined continuous measures of outcome using standardised mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), combined dichotomous measures using risk ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs, and conducted sensitivity analyses to test robustness. We included seventy-nine RCTs (including 90 relevant comparisons) involving 24,308 participants in the review, and studies varied in terms of risk of bias. The results of primary analyses demonstrated significantly greater improvement in depression outcomes for adults with depression treated with the collaborative care model in the short-term (SMD -0.34, 95% CI -0.41 to -0.27; RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.43), medium-term (SMD -0.28, 95% CI -0.41 to -0.15; RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.48), and long-term (SMD -0.35, 95% CI -0.46 to -0.24; RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.41); however, these significant benefits were not demonstrated into the very long-term (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.27). The results also demonstrated significantly greater improvement in anxiety outcomes for adults with anxiety treated with the collaborative care model in the short-term (SMD -0.30, 95% CI -0.44 to -0.17; RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.87), medium-term (SMD -0.33, 95% CI -0.47 to -0.19; RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.69), and long-term (SMD -0.20, 95% CI -0.34 to -0.06; RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.42); no comparisons examined the effects of the intervention on anxiety outcomes in the very long-term. There was evidence of benefit in secondary outcomes including medication use, mental health quality of life, and patient satisfaction, although there was less evidence of benefit in physical quality of life. Collaborative care is associated with significant improvement in depression and anxiety outcomes compared with usual care, and represents a useful addition to clinical pathways for adult patients with depression and anxiety.","Many people suffer from depression and anxiety, and these problems can make people feel sad, scared and even suicidal, and can affect their work, their relationships and their quality of life; depression and anxiety can occur because of personal, financial, social or health problems. Collaborative care is an innovative way of treating depression and anxiety and involves a number of health professionals working with a patient to help them overcome their problems; it often involves a medical doctor, a case manager (with training in depression and anxiety), and a mental health specialist such as a psychiatrist, with the case manager having regular contact with the person and organising care together with the medical doctor and specialist, and offering help with medication or access to a talking therapy to help the patient get better. Collaborative care has been tested with patients in a number of countries and health care systems, but it is not clear whether it should be recommended for people with depression or anxiety. In this review we found 79 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (90 comparisons) including 24,308 patients worldwide, comparing collaborative care with routine care or alternative treatments (such as consultation-liaison) for depression and anxiety; there were problems with the methods in some of the studies, for example, the methods used to allocate patients to collaborative care or routine care were not always free from bias, and many patients did not complete follow-up or provide information about their outcomes. Most of the studies focused on depression and the evidence suggests that collaborative care is better than routine care in improving depression for up to two years; a smaller number of studies examined the effect of collaborative care on anxiety and the evidence suggests that collaborative care is also better than usual care in improving anxiety for up to two years. Collaborative care increases the number of patients using medication in line with current guidance, and can improve mental health related quality of life, and patients with depression and anxiety treated with collaborative care are also more satisfied with their treatment.",1114,collaborative care; chronic disease management models; mental health problems; depression outcomes; anxiety outcomes; medication use; mental health quality of life; patient satisfaction; physical quality of life; clinical pathways,Why is there uncertainty about recommending collaborative care for depression and anxiety?,In what ways can collaborative care enhance the treatment of depression and anxiety?,Select the items that are animals,What are the common issues targeted by collaborative care?,How does collaborative care compare with routine care in managing depression?,The impact on very long-term outcomes is unclear.; The intervention is clearly less effective than routine care.; The number of health professionals involved makes it impractical.,The impact on very long-term outcomes is unclear.,By increasing the use of medication in line with guidelines.; By improving long-term physical quality of life.; By reducing the need for professional involvement.,By increasing the use of medication in line with guidelines.,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,Depression and anxiety; Cardiovascular diseases; Infectious diseases,Depression and anxiety,Collaborative care is better at improving depression outcomes; Routine care is more effective; Both have similar effects,Collaborative care is better at improving depression outcomes
674c8549a9fd90b7c8dda9d3,interactive_4,Mediterranean-style diet for the prevention of cardiovascular disease,"The Seven Countries study in the 1960s showed that populations in the Mediterranean region experienced lower coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality probably as a result of different dietary patterns. Later observational studies have confirmed the benefits of adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors but clinical trial evidence is more limited.
To determine the effectiveness of a Mediterranean-style diet for the primary and secondary prevention of CVD.
We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 9); MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 25 September 2018); Embase (Ovid, 1980 to 2018 week 39); Web of Science Core Collection (Thomson Reuters, 1900 to 26 September 2018); DARE Issue 2 of 4, 2015 (Cochrane Library); HTA Issue 4 of 4, 2016 (Cochrane Library); NHS EED Issue 2 of 4, 2015 (Cochrane Library). We searched trial registers and applied no language restrictions.
We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in healthy adults and adults at high risk of CVD (primary prevention) and those with established CVD (secondary prevention). Both of the following key components were required to reach our definition of a Mediterranean-style diet: high monounsaturated/saturated fat ratio (use of olive oil as main cooking ingredient and/or consumption of other traditional foods high in monounsaturated fats such as tree nuts) and a high intake of plant-based foods, including fruits, vegetables and legumes. Additional components included: low to moderate red wine consumption; high consumption of whole grains and cereals; low consumption of meat and meat products and increased consumption of fish; moderate consumption of milk and dairy products. The intervention could be dietary advice, provision of relevant foods, or both. The comparison group received either no intervention, minimal intervention, usual care or another dietary intervention. Outcomes included clinical events and CVD risk factors. We included only studies with follow-up periods of three months or more defined as the intervention period plus post intervention follow-up.
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We conducted four main comparisons: 1. Mediterranean dietary intervention versus no intervention or minimal intervention for primary prevention; 2. Mediterranean dietary intervention versus another dietary intervention for primary prevention; 3. Mediterranean dietary intervention versus usual care for secondary prevention; 4. Mediterranean dietary intervention versus another dietary intervention for secondary prevention.
In this substantive review update, 30 RCTs (49 papers) (12,461 participants randomised) and seven ongoing trials met our inclusion criteria. The majority of trials contributed to primary prevention: comparisons 1 (nine trials) and 2 (13 trials). Secondary prevention trials were included for comparison 3 (two trials) and comparison 4 (four trials plus an additional two trials that were excluded from the main analyses due to published concerns regarding the reliability of the data). Two trials reported on adverse events where these were absent or minor (low- to moderate-quality evidence). No trials reported on costs or health-related quality of life. Primary prevention The included studies for comparison 1 did not report on clinical endpoints (CVD mortality, total mortality or non-fatal endpoints such as myocardial infarction or stroke). The PREDIMED trial (included in comparison 2) was retracted and re-analysed following concerns regarding randomisation at two of 11 sites. Low-quality evidence shows little or no effect of the PREDIMED (7747 randomised) intervention (advice to follow a Mediterranean diet plus supplemental extra-virgin olive oil or tree nuts) compared to a low-fat diet on CVD mortality (hazard ratio (HR) 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50 to 1.32) or total mortality (HR 1.0, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.24) over 4.8 years. There was, however, a reduction in the number of strokes with the PREDIMED intervention (HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.80), a decrease from 24/1000 to 14/1000 (95% CI 11 to 19), moderate-quality evidence). For CVD risk factors for comparison 1 there was low-quality evidence for a possible small reduction in total cholesterol (-0.16 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.32 to 0.00) and moderate-quality evidence for a reduction in systolic (-2.99 mmHg (95% CI -3.45 to -2.53) and diastolic blood pressure (-2.0 mmHg, 95% CI -2.29 to -1.71), with low or very low-quality evidence of little or no effect on LDL or HDL cholesterol or triglycerides. For comparison 2 there was moderate-quality evidence of a possible small reduction in LDL cholesterol (-0.15 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.27 to -0.02) and triglycerides (-0.09 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.16 to -0.01) with moderate or low-quality evidence of little or no effect on total or HDL cholesterol or blood pressure. Secondary prevention For secondary prevention, the Lyon Diet Heart Study (comparison 3) examined the effect of advice to follow a Mediterranean diet and supplemental canola margarine compared to usual care in 605 CHD patients over 46 months and there was low-quality evidence of a reduction in adjusted estimates for CVD mortality (HR 0.35, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.82) and total mortality (HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.92) with the intervention. Only one small trial (101 participants) provided unadjusted estimates for composite clinical endpoints for comparison 4 (very low-quality evidence of uncertain effect). For comparison 3 there was low-quality evidence of little or no effect of a Mediterranean-style diet on lipid levels and very low-quality evidence for blood pressure. Similarly, for comparison 4 where only two trials contributed to the analyses there was low or very low-quality evidence of little or no effect of the intervention on lipid levels or blood pressure.
Despite the relatively large number of studies included in this review, there is still some uncertainty regarding the effects of a Mediterranean-style diet on clinical endpoints and CVD risk factors for both primary and secondary prevention. The quality of evidence for the modest benefits on CVD risk factors in primary prevention is low or moderate, with a small number of studies reporting minimal harms. There is a paucity of evidence for secondary prevention. The ongoing studies may provide more certainty in the future.","It is well established that diet plays a major role in cardiovascular disease risk. The traditional Mediterranean dietary pattern is of particular interest because of observations from the 1960s that populations in countries of the Mediterranean region, such as Greece and Italy, had lower mortality from cardiovascular disease compared with northern European populations or the US, probably as a result of different eating habits.
This review assessed the effects of providing dietary advice to follow a Mediterranean-style diet or provision of foods relevant to the diet (or both) to healthy adults, people at increased risk of cardiovascular disease and those with cardiovascular disease, in order to prevent the occurrence or recurrence of cardiovascular disease and reduce the risk factors associated with it. Definitions of a Mediterranean dietary pattern vary and we included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions that reported both of the following key components: a high monounsaturated/saturated fat ratio (use of olive oil as main cooking ingredient and/or consumption of other traditional foods high in monounsaturated fats such as tree nuts) and a high intake of plant-based foods, including fruits, vegetables and legumes. Additional components included: low to moderate red wine consumption; high consumption of whole grains and cereals; low consumption of meat and meat products and increased consumption of fish; moderate consumption of milk and dairy products. The control group was no intervention or minimal intervention, usual care or another dietary intervention. We found 30 RCTs (49 papers) that met these criteria. The trials varied enormously in the participants recruited and the different dietary interventions. We grouped studies to look at the effects of following a Mediterranean-style diet into the following four categories to help us with our interpretation of the results:
1. Mediterranean dietary intervention compared to no intervention or a minimal intervention to prevent the onset of cardiovascular disease;
2. Mediterranean dietary intervention compared to another dietary intervention to prevent the onset of cardiovascular disease;
3. Mediterranean dietary intervention compared to usual care for people with cardiovascular disease to prevent recurrence;
4. Mediterranean dietary intervention compared to another dietary intervention for people with cardiovascular disease to prevent recurrence.
Few trials reported on the occurrence of cardiovascular disease either in those with or without disease to begin with. A large trial in people at high risk of cardiovascular disease found a benefit of the Mediterranean dietary intervention compared to a low-fat diet on the risk of having a stroke, but not on heart attacks, death from heart disease or other causes. A further study in people with cardiovascular disease found a benefit of the Mediterranean dietary intervention on death from heart disease or other causes. We rated these two studies as providing low to moderate-quality evidence. We had to exclude two studies from our analyses as concerns had been raised that the data were unreliable. The other trials in the review measured risk factors for cardiovascular disease. There was low to moderate-quality evidence for some beneficial changes in lipid levels and blood pressure with a Mediterranean-style diet in people without disease. In people with cardiovascular disease already there was very low to low-quality evidence that there was no effect of a Mediterranean-style diet on risk factors.

674c8549a9fd90b7c8dda9d3,finetuned_5,Is favipiravir useful in treating people with COVID-19?,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to challenge the health workforce and societies worldwide. Favipiravir was suggested by some experts to be effective and safe to use in COVID-19. Although this drug has been evaluated in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), it is still unclear if it has a definite role in the treatment of COVID-19. The aim of this Cochrane Review was to assess the effects of favipiravir compared to no treatment, supportive treatment, or other experimental antiviral treatment in people with acute COVID-19. Researchers searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, MEDLINE, Embase, the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease, and three other databases up to 18 July 2023 for RCTs evaluating the efficacy of favipiravir in treating people with COVID-19. Using standard Cochrane methodological procedures and the GRADE approach, they included 25 trials that randomized 5750 adults (most under 60 years of age) across multiple countries, with most participants hospitalized with mild to moderate disease (89%). Twenty-two trials compared favipiravir to placebo or standard of care, two used lopinavir/ritonavir, and one used umifenovir; most regimens began with 1600 mg or 1800 mg twice daily on day one, followed by 600 mg to 800 mg twice daily for five to 14 days. The evidence remains very uncertain regarding whether favipiravir reduces all-cause mortality at 28 to 30 days or in-hospital (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.46; 11 trials, 3459 participants), or whether it reduces progression to invasive mechanical ventilation (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.09; 8 trials, 1383 participants). Favipiravir may make little to no difference in the need for hospital admission among ambulatory patients (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.46; 4 trials, 670 participants), and the evidence is very uncertain regarding time to clinical improvement (HR 1.13, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.83; 4 trials, 721 participants). It may also make little to no difference in progression to oxygen therapy (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.75; 2 trials, 543 participants). Favipiravir may lead to an increased incidence of adverse events overall (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.54; 18 trials, 4699 participants), but may result in little to no difference in serious adverse events attributable to the drug (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.42; 12 trials, 3317 participants). Overall, low- to very low-certainty evidence means that it is not known whether favipiravir is efficacious in people with COVID-19 illness of any severity or admission status, and while treatment may increase general adverse events, it may not increase serious adverse events.","What is favipiravir? Favipiravir is a medicine that can fight viruses. It is usually taken by mouth. Originally used for treating other viral infections, favipiravir has been suggested as a potential treatment for COVID-19 as it prevents the reproduction of the virus. Medical regulators have approved favipiravir for emergency use to treat people with COVID-19. What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out if favipiravir was better than no treatment, supportive treatment, or any other experimental antiviral treatment for people with COVID-19, in terms of death, need for a breathing machine (mechanical ventilation), and other outcomes. We also wanted to find out if favipiravir was associated with any unwanted effects. What did we do? We searched for studies that compared favipiravir with no treatment, supportive treatment, or other antiviral treatment in people with COVID-19 disease. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. What did we find? We found 25 relevant studies involving 5750 people. The studies were conducted in 13 different countries: Bahrain, Brazil, China, India, Iran, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, the UK, and the USA. Most people were under 60 years old and had mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms. What are the main results of our review?  We do not know if favipiravir reduces the number of people who die from COVID-19 when compared to dummy treatment, standard of care, or other antiviral medicines. The evidence supporting this is not very strong (derived from 11 studies involving 3459 people). It is also very unclear if favipiravir reduces the need for people to be put on ventilators compared to a dummy treatment or any other antiviral treatments (derived from 8 studies involving 1383 people). In people with mild symptoms, using favipiravir may not reduce the likelihood of needing hospitalization, but more research is needed to be sure (derived from 4 studies involving 670 people). Favipiravir has an unclear effect on the time it takes for people to improve, as defined by a reduction in their illness severity (derived from 4 studies involving 721 people).  Favipiravir seems to make very little difference in reducing the need for treatment with oxygen, compared to a dummy treatment or other antiviral treatment (derived from 2 studies involving 543 people). Favipiravir might lead to mild side effects (derived from 18 studies involving 4699 people) but doesn't seem to cause major or severe side effects (derived from 12 studies involving 3317 people). What are the limitations of the evidence? Our confidence in the evidence for using favipiravir is limited because people in the studies had different disease severities and the studies were of varying sizes and had inconsistent results.",1107,COVID-19 pandemic; SARS-CoV-2; favipiravir; all-cause mortality; invasive mechanical ventilation; ambulatory patients; oxygen therapy; adverse events; serious adverse events; lopinavir/ritonavir,"In evaluating the study outcomes, how should the inconsistent results influence future clinical guidelines regarding favipiravir?",Which methodological approaches from this review could be enhanced to better support favipiravir efficacy conclusions in future studies?,Select all of the following that are fruits,"Based on the plain-language summary, how could the clarity of favipiravir's effects on mechanical ventilation be improved?",Which outcome did the research hope to clarify regarding favipiravir's effect?,Inconsistent results suggest caution in widespread use without further research.; Inconsistencies indicate immediate adoption into treatment protocols.; They show consistent efficacy across all outcomes.,Inconsistent results suggest caution in widespread use without further research.,Only include studies with the most positive outcomes.; Increase uniformity in disease severity among participants.; Focus exclusively on small-scale trials to ensure manageability.,Increase uniformity in disease severity among participants.,dog; blue; grape,grape,By increasing the number of studies focusing on severe cases.; By completely excluding severe cases from trials.; By reducing the number of studies included in the analysis.,By increasing the number of studies focusing on severe cases.,Need for mechanical ventilation; Cure for COVID-19; Prevention of new infections,Need for mechanical ventilation
674c8549a9fd90b7c8dda9d3,finetuned_6,Interventions to prevent asthma attacks in children upon return to school in the autumn,"Asthma exacerbations in school-aged children peak in autumn shortly after they return to school, likely due to factors such as poor treatment adherence, increased allergen and viral exposure, and changes in immune tolerance. Because this seasonal peak is predictable occurring in September in the Northern Hemisphere and February in the Southern Hemisphere targeted interventions may help reduce exacerbations and lessen the strain on health services. This review assessed the effects of pharmacological and behavioural interventions implemented before school return to reduce autumn asthma exacerbations in children. We searched major trial registries and databases up to 1 December 2017, with no language restrictions. We included randomised controlled trials comparing pre-autumn interventions with usual care in children aged 18 years or younger. Standard Cochrane methods were used for study selection, data extraction, and bias assessment. The primary outcome was the proportion of children experiencing an asthma exacerbation requiring hospitalisation or oral corticosteroids during autumn. Of 546 trials screened, five met the inclusion criteria, enrolling 14,252 children. All studies were conducted in the Northern Hemisphere. Three interventions used leukotriene receptor antagonists, one used omalizumab or an inhaled corticosteroid boost, and the largest study (12,179 children) used a medication reminder letter. Although individual studies generally had low risk of bias, the evidence quality was downgraded due to imprecision, inconsistency, and indirect outcome measurement. Only one US study involving 513 children with asthma and allergic sensitisation reported data for the primary outcome. In this study, exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids or hospitalisation within 90 days of school return were reduced to 11.3% in the omalizumab group compared with 21.0% in the placebo group. The other studies used different exacerbation definitions. A pooled analysis of two leukotriene receptor antagonist trials found no effect on exacerbations, and the reminder-letter intervention did not reduce unscheduled respiratory healthcare contacts between September and December. Four studies reported adverse events, with no evidence of differences between intervention and usual care groups. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were not possible due to insufficient data. Seasonal omalizumab treatment starting four to six weeks before school return may reduce autumn asthma exacerbations, with no increase in adverse effects aside from injection site pain, although the treatment is costly. There was no evidence regarding effects on asthma control, quality of life, or mortality. Future trials should clearly define exacerbations, standardise outcome measures, and carefully characterise participants to allow analysis of subgroup effects.","Asthma is a long-term condition affecting the lungs. It is the most common long-term condition affecting children. One in 11 children in the United Kingdom have asthma. People with asthma can experience asthma 'attacks' of coughing, wheezing, and difficulty breathing. Each year there is a peak in asthma attacks after school restarts in autumn. The likely reason for this is that children are exposed to more viruses that can trigger asthma. Children may also have taken their regular medication less consistently with the break in routine over the summer. As this increase in attacks at the start of the school year is predictable, and the reason for it is somewhat understood, it might be preventable. Approaches to reducing autumn asthma attacks include using extra medications when school restarts or medication reminders during the school holiday. Our searches found 546 trials, of which five were relevant. In total, 14,252 children were randomly assigned to receive either an intervention targeting autumn asthma attacks or usual care. Four small studies (approximately 200 to 1200 children in each) gave children extra asthma medication; these additional medications were omalizumab, leukotriene receptor antagonist tablets, or increased doses of inhaled steroids. One study sent a medication reminder letter over the summer holidays to parents of children with asthma. One trial gave children either omalizumab or placebo. Omalizumab is an antibody designed to alter the immune response. It was given by injection regularly over four to six weeks before school return (i.e. over the bulk of the summer holidays). The children in this study had known allergic asthma. The study showed that omalizumab might reduce autumn attacks. Eleven per cent of those receiving omalizumab had an asthma attack during the first 90 days compared to 21% of those receiving placebo. Three studies used leukotriene receptor antagonist tablets, either montelukast or pranlukast. Although the results of one study suggested that seasonal montelukast might reduce autumn attacks, there was no evidence of reduced attacks in the other two later trials, including a second larger trial of montelukast. There was no evidence that sending a reminder letter reduces the number of children requiring an unplanned healthcare contact. No study provided evidence that the total number of children experiencing adverse events was greater in the intervention than in the usual care group. Our findings were limited by the small numbers of studies identified and because these studies used different interventions and definitions of asthma exacerbations. Further research is needed to better understand how to prevent seasonal attacks, including interventions suitable for children with mild asthma, where expensive and painful treatments are not justified.",1078,asthma exacerbations; allergic sensitisation; leukotriene receptor antagonists; omalizumab; inhaled corticosteroid boost; oral corticosteroids; placebo group; unscheduled respiratory healthcare contacts; adverse events; asthma control,How do the various interventions compare in their effectiveness to reduce autumn asthma attacks?,What was the primary purpose of the study discussed in the summary?,Select all of the following that are fruits,How did the seasonal omalizumab treatment affect asthma exacerbations in the study?,What problem is associated with the increase of asthma attacks in autumn?,Omalizumab proved more effective than leukotriene receptor antagonists.; The medication reminder letter showed the highest reduction in attacks.; All interventions showed equal effectiveness.,Omalizumab proved more effective than leukotriene receptor antagonists.,To assess the effects of pre-autumn interventions on asthma exacerbations in children.; To find new medications for asthma treatment.; To study summer activities of children with asthma.,To assess the effects of pre-autumn interventions on asthma exacerbations in children.,dog; blue; grape,grape,Reduced exacerbations by 11%; Reduced exacerbations to 11% of occurrences; Increased exacerbations by 21%,Reduced exacerbations to 11% of occurrences,Increased contact with triggers such as viruses; Children change their class schedules; Decrease in temperatures leading to cold symptoms,Increased contact with triggers such as viruses
674c8549a9fd90b7c8dda9d3,finetuned_6,Is molnupiravir (an antiviral medicine) safe and effective in treating people with COVID-19?,"To assess the effects of molnupiravir in people with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and mild to moderate symptoms. We identified all relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) by searching the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, Science Citation Index Expanded, the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Literature on Coronavirus Disease database, and the COVID Network Meta-Analysis database with no language restrictions up to 26 April 2024. In outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19, molnupiravir 800 mg taken orally every 12 hours for five days probably results in little to no difference in all-cause mortality and may result in little to no difference in rates of hospitalisation and symptom resolution. There is evidence of increased viral clearance by day 5, but the clinical relevance of this finding is unclear. There is probably little to no difference in adverse events, and there is little to no difference in serious adverse events, with molnupiravir versus placebo or standard care. Inpatient data are lacking, and there is no evidence of benefit of molnupiravir in this population. Further research involving inpatients may change this.","Molnupiravir is a pill used to treat COVID-19 in people who are at high risk of developing severe illness. It works by interfering with the ability of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) to reproduce, helping the body to fight off the infection. We wanted to find out how molnupiravir compares to no treatment, placebo (dummy treatment), or standard of care in decreasing death and hospitalisation in people with COVID-19; speeding up recovery (time to symptom resolution); clearing the virus that causes COVID-19 (viral clearance); safety, by looking at all unwanted events and serious unwanted events. We searched for studies that evaluated molnupiravir compared with no treatment, placebo, or standard of care in people with confirmed COVID-19. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods. The types of studies we looked at were randomised controlled trials, which assign people randomly to two or more treatment groups. This is the best way to ensure that study groups are similar, and that investigators and participants don't know who is in which group. The review included 11 studies with 31,272 participants, mostly outpatients (people not admitted to hospital) with mild to moderate COVID-19. When we combined results from studies that recruited outpatients (people not admitted to hospital) with mild to moderate COVID-19, we found the following key results: Molnupiravir probably results in little to no difference in the risk of death. Compared with people receiving placebo or standard of care, between four and 10 fewer people receiving molnupiravir will die within one month for every 10,000 people treated. We considered this reduction clinically insignificant. Molnupiravir may not reduce hospitalisations, meaning it may not prevent people from getting sicker or needing hospital care. There was evidence of increased viral clearance with molnupiravir by day 5, but this effect diminished by day 14, and we are not sure if it makes any real difference for patients. Molnupiravir may have little to no effect on the probability of having no symptoms by day 14 or day 28. Molnupiravir probably results in little to no difference in adverse events, and results in little to no difference in serious adverse events. There are too few data to draw clear conclusions about molnupiravir's effects in people admitted to hospital with severe COVID-19. Most evidence comes from studies conducted in outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19, so the results may not apply to people with severe illness who are hospitalised. The studies provided scarce evidence on long-term outcomes such as quality of life after recovery or how long the virus stays in the body.

5db0a97f127d4000117cdfa0,static_2,"Education, incentive, and engineering-based interventions to promotethe use of seat belts","Over 1.3 million people die each year as a result of traffic collisions and hundreds of thousands of others are permanently and seriouslyinjured. Most of these deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries, where mortality rates can be up to 10 times higher than those ofsome high-income countries. Seat belts are designed to accomplish two key functions: to prevent the occupant from being ejected fromthe vehicle by the force of impact, and to extend the time that the decelerating force is applied to a person. Seat belts also spread the area ofimpact both to larger and less vulnerable parts of the body. Since the 1950s, seat belts have been factory-fitted to most vehicles, and todayaround 90% of high-income countries have adopted seat belt legislation that makes it mandatory for some, if not all, vehicle occupants towear seat belts. However, the simple passing of laws is not sufficient to ensure seat belt use, and, while the enforcement of seat belt lawsdoes increase seat belt use, other interventions have been developed to encourage voluntary  and hence sustainable behaviour change. To evaluate the benefits of behavioural-change interventions (educational-based, incentive-based, engineering-based, or a combination,but not enforcement-based) that promote the use of seat belts, and to determine which types of interventions are most effective. On 9 August 2022, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), OvidSP Embase, OvidSP MEDLINE, 14other databases, and clinical trials registers. We also screened reference lists and conference proceedings, searched websites of relevantorganisations, and contacted road safety experts. The search was performed with no restrictions in terms of language and date ofpublication. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), both individually randomised and cluster-randomised, that evaluated education,engineering, incentive-based interventions (or combinations) that promoted seat belt use. Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of RCTs, evaluated the risk of bias, and extracted data. We performed a narrativesynthesis based on effect direction due to the heterogeneity observed between RCTs and reported the synthesis in accordance with reporting guidelines for systematic reviews without meta-analysis, as appropriate. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using theGRADE approach. We analysed data on the primary outcome, frequency of wearing a seat belt. None of the included RCTs reported theother primary outcome, crash-related injury rate or the secondary outcome, crash-related mortality rates of interest in this review. We included 15 completed RCTs (12 individual, parallel-group, and three cluster) that enroled 12,081 participants, published between1990 and 2022. Four trials were published between 2019 and 2022, and the remaining trials were published 10 or more years ago. Wealso identified four ongoing RCTs. Thirteen RCTs were conducted in the USA. Trials recruited participants from various sites (worksites,schools, emergency departments, a residential retirement community, and primary care settings) and different age groups (adults,late adolescents, early adolescents, and dyads). Thirteen trials investigated educational interventions, one of which used education inaddition to incentives (one of the intervention arms) measured through participant self-reports (12) and observation (one), and two trialsinvestigated engineering-based interventions measured through in-vehicle data monitor systems at various follow-up periods (six weeksto 36 months). We grouped RCTs according to types of education-based interventions: behavioural education-based, health risk appraisal (HRA), andother education-based interventions. The evidence suggests that behavioural education-based (four trials) interventions may promoteseat belt use and HRA interventions (one trial) likely promote seat belt use in the short term (six weeks to nine months). Four of the sixtrials that investigated behavioural education-based interventions found that the intervention compared to no or another interventionmay promote seat belt use. These effects were measured through participant self-report and at various time points (six-week to 12-monthfollow-up) (low-certainty evidence). One of the three trials investigating HRA only or with additional intervention versus no or anotherintervention showed observed effects likely to promote seat belt use (moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence suggests that engineering-based interventions using vehicle monitoring systems (with in-vehicle alerts and with or withoutnotifications/feedback) may promote the use of seat belts. One trial showed that engineering interventions (in-vehicle alerts and feedback)may promote seat belt use while the other showed unclear effects in two of the three intervention groups (low-certainty evidence). Bothtrials had small sample sizes and high baseline seat belt use. The evidence suggests that behavioural education-based interventions may promote seat belt use and HRA (including incentives) with orwithout additional interventions likely promote seat belt use. Likewise, for engineering-based interventions using in-vehicle data monitorsystems with in-vehicle alerts, with or without notifications/feedback the evidence suggests the interventions may promote the use ofseat belts. Well-designed RCTs are needed to further investigate the effectiveness of education and engineering-based interventions. High-qualitytrials that examine the potential benefits of incentives to promote seat belt use, either alone or in combination with other interventions, aswell as trials to investigate other types of interventions (such as technology, media/publicity, enforcement, insurance schemes, employerprogrammes, etc.) to promote the use of seat belts, are needed. Evidence from low- and middle-income economies is required to improvethe generalisability of the data. In addition, research focused on determining which interventions or types of interventions are mosteffective in different population groups is needed.","Why is wearing a seat belt important? Many people, mostly children and young adults, die each year as a result of road traffic injuries suggesting it to be a leading cause of death with around 75% of traffic-related deaths occurring among young males. Many others are permanently and seriously injured. Seat belts are designed to protect occupants from being thrown out of the vehicle by the force of impact, and spread the impact across less vulnerable parts of the body to lessen the damage. Passing laws mandating seat belt use is not sufficient to encourage seat belt use on its own. We investigated the effectiveness of education, incentive, or engineering-based interventions, but not law enforcement, to encourage seat belt use and determine which types of interventions are most effective. Educational-based interventions are structured programmes teaching drivers and passengers the importance of using seat belts. Engineering-based interventions are design changes to the vehicle structure that promote the wearing of seat belts, such as seat belt alarms, while incentives include rewards schemes. We searched for studies that randomly allocated people travelling in passenger or commercial vehicles to interventions aiming to improve seat belt use. We excluded people travelling in farming or agricultural vehicles since these are not deemed commercial vehicles. Two review authors independently evaluated studies to judge inclusion in the review. We recorded information about the study design, setting, participants, interventions, and outcomes. In terms of outcome, we looked at the frequency of wearing a seat belt as well as crash-related injuries and deaths. Because of the differences between the included studies, we provided a written account and assessed how much each result could be trusted using the ratings high, moderate, low, or very low quality, depending on our confidence in the reliability of the results. We summarised the findings and compared study results. We found 15 studies enrolling 12,081 participants and four ongoing studies. Thirteen studies were conducted in the USA and enrolled participants from various sites (worksites, schools, emergency departments, a residential retirement community, and primary care settings) and of different age groups (adults, late and early adolescents, and dyads of child/adolescent and parent/legal guardian). Twelve studies looked at educational interventions alone, one at education and incentives, and two at engineering-based interventions. All included studies reported on the frequency of wearing a seat belt; however, most studies (12) reported this outcome through participant self-reporting. The remaining studies reported the frequency of wearing a seat belt through in-vehicle data monitoring systems (two studies) and observation (one study). None of the included studies reported crash-related injuries and deaths. Some evidence suggests that education-based and engineering-based interventions may promote seat belt use; however, we cannot be confident in the current evidence. For education-based interventions, evidence suggests that behavioural-based (motivational interviews, behavioural change counselling, and behavioural messages) and HRA (alone or with educational information plus incentive) interventions may improve seat belt use in early adolescents, late adolescents, and adults. The evidence suggests that engineering-based interventions may promote seat belt use in early adolescents and adults. More research is needed to better understand the effectiveness of education- and engineering-based interventions on seat belt use. In addition, high-quality research is needed to investigate the benefit of incentives alone or in combination with other interventions as well as research to investigate other types of interventions, different combinations of interventions, settings (such as low- and middle-income countries), and populations. Only two studies looked at engineering-based interventions to improve seat belt use and both studies enrolled a small number of participants making it challenging to conclude that these interventions are beneficial. Trials investigating educational interventions to improve seat belt use vary in terms of the type of intervention, quality, number and types of people in the study, etc. Studies included children, adolescents, and adults; however, the most effective intervention for each population group remains unclear. Our confidence in the evidence was low or moderate, mainly due to the outcome (wearing seat belts) being measured through participant self-reporting. Self-reported outcomes are open to being influenced by participants answering in a manner they believe to be desirable or by participants' limited recollection of the event being studied. None of the included studies was conducted in countries where deaths and injuries related to road traffic accidents are the highest.",1059,mortality rates; decelerating force; behavioural-change interventions; crash-related injury rate; engineering-based interventions; health risk appraisal,What factors might have contributed to the low certainty of evidence in the current study?,Identify the main goal of the study discussed in the summary.,Select all of the following that are colors,Summarize why seat belt laws alone are insufficient according to the summary.,Recognize the types of interventions evaluated in the study.,Inconsistencies in definitions of seat belt use.; Differences in intervention effectiveness across studies.; Inclusion of outdated intervention methods.,Differences in intervention effectiveness across studies.,To determine the most effective seat belt laws.; To evaluate interventions that promote seat belt use.; To analyze the decrease in car accidents.,To evaluate interventions that promote seat belt use.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Laws alone do not guarantee behavior change.; People do not understand the fines involved.; Drivers forget to read laws regularly.,Laws alone do not guarantee behavior change.,"Educational, incentive, and engineering-based.; Law enforcement and punishment-based.; Technological and media-based.","Educational, incentive, and engineering-based."
5db0a97f127d4000117cdfa0,static_2,Do physical measures such as hand-washing or wearing masks stop or slow down the spread of respiratory viruses?,"Viral epidemics or pandemics of acute respiratory infections (ARIs) pose a global threat, such as the influenza (H1N1) pandemic in 2009 caused by the H1N1pdm09 virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 in 2019, and antiviral drugs and vaccines may be insufficient to prevent their spread; this is an update of a Cochrane Review last published in 2020 and includes results from studies conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. The objective was to assess the effectiveness of physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of acute respiratory viruses. We searched CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and two trials registers in October 2022, with backward and forward citation analysis. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-RCTs investigating physical interventions (screening at entry ports, isolation, quarantine, physical distancing, personal protection, hand hygiene, face masks, glasses, and gargling) to prevent respiratory virus transmission, and used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We included 11 new RCTs and cluster-RCTs (610,872 participants), bringing the total to 78; six were conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic (two from Mexico, and one each from Denmark, Bangladesh, England, and Norway), and we identified four ongoing studies, one completed but unreported, evaluating masks during COVID-19. Many studies were conducted during non-epidemic influenza periods, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, or influenza seasons up to 2016, meaning many occurred under lower viral circulation compared with COVID-19; settings varied widely, from suburban schools to hospital wards in high-income countries, crowded inner-city areas in low-income countries, and an immigrant neighbourhood in a high-income country, and adherence to interventions was low in many studies, with risk of bias mostly high or unclear. We included 12 trials comparing medical/surgical masks versus no masks (two in healthcare workers and 10 in the community); wearing masks in the community probably makes little or no difference in influenza-like illness/COVID-like illness compared to not wearing masks (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.09; 9 trials, 276,917 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and probably makes little or no difference in laboratory-confirmed influenza/SARS-CoV-2 (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.42; 6 trials, 13,919 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), with harms rarely measured. For N95/P2 respirators compared to medical/surgical masks, pooled trials (four in healthcare settings and one in a household) show very uncertain effects on clinical respiratory illness (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.10; 3 trials, 7779 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and they may be effective for ILI (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.03; 5 trials, 8407 participants; low-certainty evidence); for laboratory-confirmed influenza, N95/P2 respirators probably make little or no difference (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.34; 5 trials, 8407 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Restricting analyses to healthcare workers made no difference; harms were poorly measured, though discomfort was reported. One recently published RCT found medical/surgical masks non-inferior to N95 respirators in 1009 healthcare workers across four countries treating COVID-19 patients. For hand hygiene, 19 trials compared interventions with controls across schools, childcare centres, and homes; hand hygiene resulted in a 14% relative reduction in ARIs (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.90; 9 trials, 52,105 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), reducing cases from 380 to 327 per 1000 people. For ILI (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.09; 11 trials, 34,503 participants; low-certainty evidence) and laboratory-confirmed influenza (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.30; 8 trials, 8332 participants; low-certainty evidence), effects suggested little or no difference. Pooled data from 19 trials (71,210 participants) for ARI/ILI/influenza found hand hygiene may be beneficial with an 11% relative reduction (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.94; low-certainty evidence), though with high heterogeneity; harms were rarely reported. No RCTs were found for gowns and gloves, face shields, or screening at entry ports. The high risk of bias, variation in outcome measurement, and low adherence hinder firm conclusions; additional RCTs during the pandemic existed but were relatively few despite the importance of evaluating masking and adherence, especially in vulnerable groups. There remains uncertainty about the effects of face masks, with low to moderate certainty meaning confidence is limited and true effects may differ; pooled RCTs did not show a clear reduction in respiratory viral infection with medical/surgical masks, and no clear difference was seen between medical/surgical masks and N95/P2 respirators in healthcare workers providing routine care. Hand hygiene is likely to modestly reduce respiratory illness, though not significantly for ILI or laboratory-confirmed influenza. Harms were under-investigated. There is a need for large, well-designed RCTs across multiple settings and populations to evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions and the impact of adherence, especially among those at highest risk of ARIs.","Respiratory viruses are viruses that infect the cells in your airways: nose, throat, and lungs and these infections can cause serious problems and affect normal breathing, leading to illnesses such as flu (influenza), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and COVID-19. People infected with a respiratory virus spread virus particles into the air when they cough or sneeze, and others become infected if they come into contact with these particles in the air or on surfaces; respiratory viruses can spread quickly through communities, populations, countries (causing epidemics), and around the world (causing pandemics). Physical measures to try to prevent respiratory viruses spreading include washing hands often; not touching your eyes, nose, or mouth; sneezing or coughing into your elbow; wiping surfaces with disinfectant; wearing masks, eye protection, gloves, and gowns; avoiding contact with other people (isolation or quarantine); keeping a distance from others; and screening people entering a country for signs of infection. We wanted to find out whether physical measures stop or slow the spread of respiratory viruses from well-controlled randomised controlled trials comparing one intervention to another. We searched for randomised controlled studies that looked at physical measures to stop people acquiring a respiratory virus infection and were interested in how many people caught a respiratory virus infection and whether the physical measures had unwanted effects. We identified 78 relevant studies conducted in low-, middle-, and high-income countries in hospitals, schools, homes, offices, childcare centres, and communities during non-epidemic influenza periods, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, influenza seasons up to 2016, and during the COVID-19 pandemic; five ongoing, unpublished studies were found, two evaluating masks for COVID-19, with five trials funded by government and pharmaceutical companies, and nine funded by pharmaceutical companies. No studies looked at face shields, gowns and gloves, or screening at borders. We assessed the effects of medical or surgical masks, N95/P2 respirators (close-fitting masks filtering inhaled air, mostly used by healthcare workers), and hand hygiene (hand-washing or hand sanitiser). For medical or surgical masks, ten studies took place in the community and two in healthcare workers; compared with wearing no mask (community studies only), wearing a mask may make little to no difference in how many people caught a flu-like or COVID-like illness (9 studies; 276,917 people), and probably makes little or no difference in how many had flu or COVID confirmed by a lab test (6 studies; 13,919 people), with discomfort rarely reported. For N95/P2 respirators, four studies were in healthcare workers and one small study in the community; compared with wearing surgical masks, N95/P2 respirators probably make little to no difference in confirmed flu (5 studies; 8407 people) and may make little to no difference in flu-like illness (5 studies; 8407 people) or respiratory illness (3 studies; 7799 people), with discomfort mentioned. For hand hygiene, following a hand hygiene programme may reduce respiratory or flu-like illness or confirmed flu compared with no programme (19 studies; 71,210 people), although the reduction was not statistically confirmed when ILI and lab-confirmed ILI were analysed separately; few studies measured unwanted effects, with skin irritation from sanitiser mentioned. Our confidence in these results is generally low to moderate for subjective outcomes such as respiratory illness, but moderate for more precise laboratory-confirmed infection outcomes related to masks and N95/P2 respirators; results may change with more evidence, and adherence to mask-wearing and hand hygiene was relatively low, which may have affected study outcomes.",1111,acute respiratory infections (ARIs); SARS-CoV-2; H1N1pdm09 virus; severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS); N95/P2 respirators; laboratory-confirmed influenza; influenza-like illness (ILI); physical interventions; antiviral drugs; viral epidemics,What can be deduced about the effectiveness of physical interventions such as masks in different settings from the studyÃ¢ÂÂs findings?,What criteria can be used to evaluate the reliability of the study's conclusions about the use of hand hygiene?,Select all of the following that are fruits,What are the implications of the studyÃ¢ÂÂs findings for the future design of respiratory virus prevention trials?,How could the limited findings on harms associated with interventions impact public health policies?,Masks show consistent effectiveness across all settings.; Effectiveness of masks is inconsistent across different settings.; Masks are ineffective in low-income settings.,Effectiveness of masks is inconsistent across different settings.,The number of trials and participants involved in the hand hygiene studies.; The consistency of outcomes across different respiratory diseases.; The number of different viruses tested in isolation settings only.,The number of trials and participants involved in the hand hygiene studies.; The consistency of outcomes across different respiratory diseases.,dog; blue; grape,grape,Designing trials with a focus on heterogeneous settings and high adherence to interventions.; Excluding healthcare worker settings to focus on community settings only.; Including a wider range of physical interventions besides masks and hand hygiene.,Designing trials with a focus on heterogeneous settings and high adherence to interventions.; Including a wider range of physical interventions besides masks and hand hygiene.,Policies may proceed cautiously due to potential undisclosed harms.; Limited harm reporting justifies the unrestricted use of interventions.; It necessitates further research to guide evidence-based policy decisions.,Policies may proceed cautiously due to potential undisclosed harms.; It necessitates further research to guide evidence-based policy decisions.
5db0a97f127d4000117cdfa0,interactive_3,"Pharmacological, non-invasive brain stimulation and psychological interventions for treating depression after stroke","Depression is an important morbidity associated with stroke that impacts on recovery, yet is often undetected or inadequately treated. This review aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of pharmacological intervention, non-invasive brain stimulation, psychological therapy, or combinations of these to treat depression after stroke. This is a living systematic review, and we search for new evidence every two months and update the review when we identify relevant new evidence; we searched the Specialised Registers of Cochrane Stroke and Cochrane Depression Anxiety and Neurosis, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, five other databases, two clinical trials registers, reference lists and conference proceedings (February 2022), and contacted study authors. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were eligible if they compared pharmacological interventions with placebo; non-invasive brain stimulation with sham stimulation or usual care; psychological therapy with usual care or attention control; pharmacological intervention and psychological therapy with pharmacological intervention and usual care or attention control; pharmacological intervention and non-invasive brain stimulation with pharmacological intervention and sham stimulation or usual care; non-invasive brain stimulation and psychological therapy versus sham brain stimulation or usual care and psychological therapy; pharmacological intervention and psychological therapy with placebo and psychological therapy; pharmacological intervention and non-invasive brain stimulation with placebo and non-invasive brain stimulation; and non-invasive brain stimulation and psychological therapy versus non-invasive brain stimulation and usual care or attention control, with the intention of treating depression after stroke. Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data; we calculated mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous data and risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous data with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), assessed heterogeneity using the I² statistic, and evaluated certainty of evidence according to GRADE. We included 65 trials (72 comparisons) with 5831 participants, with data available for 20 comparisons involving pharmacological interventions, nine for non-invasive brain stimulation, 25 for psychological therapy, three for pharmacological plus psychological therapy, 14 for pharmacological plus non-invasive brain stimulation, and one for non-invasive brain stimulation plus psychological therapy, and no trials for three other comparisons. For pharmacological interventions, very low-certainty evidence from eight trials suggests decreased numbers of people meeting study criteria for depression (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.88; 8 RCTs; 1025 participants) and decreased inadequate response to treatment (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.70; 6 RCTs; 511 participants) compared to placebo, but more adverse events related to the CNS (RR 1.55, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.15; 5 RCTs; 488 participants) and gastrointestinal system (RR 1.62, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.19; 4 RCTs; 473 participants) occurred with pharmacological intervention. For non-invasive brain stimulation, very low-certainty evidence from two trials showed little to no effect on depression or inadequate treatment response compared to sham stimulation. For psychological therapy, very low-certainty evidence from six trials suggests decreased depression prevalence (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.95; 521 participants) compared to usual care/attention control, with no differences in deaths or adverse events. For combined pharmacological and psychological therapy, no trials reported primary outcomes. For pharmacological intervention plus non-invasive brain stimulation, combination therapy reduced depression prevalence (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.91; 3 RCTs; 392 participants; low-certainty evidence) but did not reduce inadequate treatment response (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.30; 3 RCTs; 392 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and very low-certainty evidence from five trials suggested no difference in deaths. No primary outcomes were reported for non-invasive brain stimulation plus psychological therapy. Overall, very low-certainty evidence suggests that pharmacological, psychological, and combination therapies can reduce the prevalence of depression after stroke, while non-invasive brain stimulation has little to no effect, and pharmacological interventions were associated with CNS and gastrointestinal adverse events; more research is required before routine use of such treatments can be recommended.","Do pharmacological treatments, non-invasive brain stimulation (electrodes are placed on the scalp and a finely controlled electric current is applied to change brain activity), psychological treatments, or combination treatments reduce the proportion of people with depression or the extent of depressive symptoms after stroke? Depression is common after stroke yet often is not detected or is inadequately treated. We identified studies by searches conducted on 8 February 2022. This is a living systematic review. We search for new evidence every two months and update the review when we identify relevant new evidence. Please refer to the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for the current status of this review. We included trials that reported on the use of pharmacological, non-invasive brain stimulation, psychological, and combined interventions to treat depression after stroke. We described the main outcomes as the number of people meeting the criteria for depression (scoring above a predefined scoring threshold) and inadequate response (scoring below 50% of the predefined scoring threshold). Average age of participants ranged from 54 to 78 years. Studies were from Asia (39), Europe (12), America (6), South America (1) and Australia (3). We included 65 trials (72 comparisons) involving 5831 participants. Pharmacological treatments resulted in fewer people meeting the study criteria for depression at end of treatment and with inadequate response to treatment. Non-invasive brain stimulation did not reduce the number of people meeting the study criteria for depression at end of treatment and with inadequate response to treatment. Psychological therapy reduced the number of people meeting the study criteria for depression at end of treatment. The combination of pharmacological treatment and non-invasive brain stimulation resulted in fewer people meeting the study criteria for depression but did not affect those with inadequate response to treatment. More people in the pharmacological treatment group reported central nervous system (e.g. confusion, sedation, tremor; in five trials) and gastrointestinal side effects (e.g. constipation, diarrhoea; in four trials) than in the placebo groups. Information on side effects of other treatments was not provided. Estimates of treatment effects were imprecise due to small numbers in most studies and recruitment of people with very different baseline characteristics. We rated the certainty of evidence as low to very low due to these and other limitations in study design. Antidepressant drugs may benefit people with persistent depressive symptoms after stroke, but care is required in their use, as little is known about their effects on overall stroke recovery. Non-invasive brain stimulation may not be of benefit while psychological and combination therapies may offer a treatment option. Future research should include a broader group of people with stroke.",1117,Depression; stroke; pharmacological intervention; non-invasive brain stimulation; psychological therapy; usual care; adverse events,"In assessing the study's outcomes for psychological therapies, which factor stands out as needing more investigation?",What conclusions can be made about the role of non-invasive brain stimulation in treating depression after stroke?,Select all of the following that are colors,What was one of the main motivations for conducting this study?,What types of treatments did the study focus on?,Effectiveness across different ethnic populations.; Unified evaluation metrics for the therapy's efficacy.; Weight loss impacts as a side effect.,Effectiveness across different ethnic populations.; Unified evaluation metrics for the therapy's efficacy.,It is not effective in reducing depressive symptoms.; It consistently reduces the number of depressive cases.; Its effects and implications require further exploration.,It is not effective in reducing depressive symptoms.; Its effects and implications require further exploration.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Depression is often detected after a stroke.; Depression is an important morbidity associated with stroke that is often undetected or inadequately treated.; Stroke recovery is not affected by depression.,Depression is an important morbidity associated with stroke that is often undetected or inadequately treated.,"Pharmacological treatments, non-invasive brain stimulation, psychological therapy, and combination treatments.; Only non-invasive brain stimulation treatments.; Surgical interventions.","Pharmacological treatments, non-invasive brain stimulation, psychological therapy, and combination treatments."
5db0a97f127d4000117cdfa0,interactive_4,Mucolytic agents for chronic bronchitis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,"Individuals with chronic bronchitis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) often experience recurrent exacerbations involving increased sputum volume or purulence. These exacerbations carry substantial personal and healthcare burdens, so therapies that reduce their occurrence may be useful. Mucolytics are oral medications intended to reduce the viscosity of sputum, making it easier to cough up, which may decrease the frequency of COPD exacerbations. This review evaluated whether mucolytics reduce exacerbations or days of disability, whether they improve lung function or quality of life, and whether they cause adverse effects. We searched major databases through 23 April 2019 and included randomized studies comparing oral mucolytics with placebo for at least two months in adults with chronic bronchitis or COPD, excluding people with asthma or cystic fibrosis. This update added four new studies, bringing the total to 38 trials with 10,377 participants, lasting from two months to three years, and covering various mucolytics such as N-acetylcysteine, carbocysteine, erdosteine, and ambroxol. Many studies had unclear allocation concealment, possible issues with blinding, and high attrition rates. Results from 28 studies with 6723 participants showed that people receiving mucolytics were more likely to remain free of exacerbations during the study period compared with placebo (Peto OR 1.73), although more recent studies showed smaller benefits than earlier ones. The number needed to treat for an average of nine months to keep one additional person free from exacerbations was eight. High heterogeneity suggests caution in interpretation, and effects did not vary meaningfully by mucolytic type, dose, COPD severity, or exacerbation history. Longer studies reported smaller treatment effects. Mucolytics reduced days of disability by 0.43 days per month compared with placebo, and they may reduce hospitalisations, although evidence was inconsistent. Some improvement in quality of life was reported, but it did not reach the threshold for clinical importance. Mucolytics were associated with a possible reduction in adverse events, though some excluded studies reported high rates of adverse events. There was no clear difference between mucolytics and placebo with respect to mortality, although estimates were imprecise. Overall, mucolytics appear to modestly reduce exacerbations, days of disability, and possibly hospitalisations without increasing adverse events, but they have little effect on lung function or health-related quality of life. High heterogeneity and larger effects in older studies reduce confidence in the findings, and true benefits may be smaller than earlier evidence suggested.","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and chronic bronchitis are long-term breathing conditions. They cause symptoms such as shortness of breath, cough, and excess sputum. People with COPD and chronic bronchitis may have flare-ups (exacerbations) when their symptoms become worse. Mucolytics are medicines taken orally that may loosen sputum, making it easier to cough it up. Mucolytics may have other beneficial effects on lung infection and inflammation and may reduce the number of flare-ups that people with COPD and chronic bronchitis have. Mucolytics can also be inhaled, but we did not look at inhaled mucolytics in this review.
We looked for studies lasting at least two months, in which it was decided at random whether a person received a mucolytic drug or a placebo. We did not include studies involving children or people with other breathing conditions such as asthma and cystic fibrosis. We found 38 studies to include in our review. These studies included a total of 10,377 adults with COPD or chronic bronchitis. The studies used a variety of mucolytic drugs, including N-acetylcysteine, carbocysteine, and erdosteine and lasted from two months to three years. Mucolytics were taken by mouth between one and three times per day. These studies measured several different outcomes to find out if the drug was useful, including flare-ups, hospital admissions, quality of life, lung function, and side effects. We are moderately confident about the results we have presented. Our confidence is reduced by the results from individual studies looking quite different from one another and the mix of older and newer studies that we found. Also, in some cases there were not enough data to be sure whether mucolytics were better or worse than, or the same as, placebo. Mucolytics appear to be useful for reducing flare-ups, days of disability, and hospital admissions in people with COPD or chronic bronchitis, and they do not appear to cause more side effects. However, they do not appear to have much impact on quality of life or lung function, and we could not be sure about their impact on death.",1077,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5db0a97f127d4000117cdfa0,interactive_4,Drug or psychological interventions for preventing depression in people with long-term physical conditions,"Major depression is one of the world's leading causes of disability in adults with long-term physical conditions compared to those without physical illness. This co-morbidity is associated with a negative prognosis in terms of increased morbidity and mortality rates, increased healthcare costs, decreased adherence to treatment regimens, and a substantial decline in quality of life. Therefore, preventing the onset of depressive episodes in adults with long-term physical conditions should be a global healthcare aim. In this review, primary or tertiary (in cases of preventing recurrences in those with a history of depression) prevention are the focus. While primary prevention aims at preventing the onset of depression, tertiary prevention comprises both preventing recurrences and prohibiting relapses. Tertiary prevention aims to address a depressive episode that might still be present, is about to subside, or has recently resolved. We included tertiary prevention in the case where the focus was preventing the onset of depression in those with a history of depression (preventing recurrences) but excluded it if it specifically focused on maintaining an condition or implementing rehabilitation services (relapse prevention). Secondary prevention of depression seeks to prevent the progression of depressive symptoms by early detection and treatment and may therefore be considered a 'treatment,' rather than prevention. We therefore exclude the whole spectrum of secondary prevention. To assess the effectiveness, acceptability and tolerability of psychological or pharmacological interventions, in comparison to control conditions, in preventing depression in adults with long-term physical conditions; either before first ever onset of depressive symptoms (i.e. primary prevention) or before first onset of depressive symptoms in patients with a history of depression (i.e. tertiary prevention). We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and two trials registries, up to 6 February 2020. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of preventive psychological or pharmacological interventions, specifically targeting incidence of depression in comparison to treatment as usual (TAU), waiting list, attention/psychological placebo, or placebo. Participants had to be age 18 years or older, with at least one long-term physical condition, and no diagnosis of major depression at baseline (primary prevention). In addition, we included studies comprising mixed samples of patients with and without a history of depression, which explored tertiary prevention of recurrent depression. We excluded other tertiary prevention studies. We also excluded secondary preventive interventions. Primary outcomes included incidence of depression, tolerability, and acceptability. Secondary outcomes included severity of depression, cost-effectiveness and cost-utility. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We included 11 RCTs, with one trial on psychological interventions, and 10 trials on pharmacological interventions. Data analyses on the psychological intervention (problem-solving therapy compared to TAU) included 194 participants with age-related macular degeneration. Data analyses on pharmacological interventions included 837 participants comparing citalopram (one trial), escitalopram (three trials), a mixed sample of fluoxetine/nortriptyline (one trial), melatonin (one trial), milnacipran (one trial), and sertraline (three trials), each to placebo. Included types of long-term physical conditions were acute coronary syndrome (one trial), breast cancer (one trial), head and neck cancer (two trials), stroke (five trials), and traumatic brain injury (one trial). Very low-certainty evidence of one study suggests that problem solving therapy may be slightly more effective than TAU in preventing the incidence of depression, immediately post-intervention (odds ratio (OR) 0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.20 to 0.95; 194 participants). However, there may be little to no difference between groups at six months follow-up (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.38; 190 participants; one study; very low-certainty evidence). No data were available regarding incidence of depression after six months. Regarding acceptability (drop-outs due to any cause), slightly fewer drop-outs occurred in the TAU group immediately post-intervention (OR 5.21, 95% CI 1.11 to 24.40; 206 participants; low-certainty evidence). After six months, however, the groups did not differ (OR 1.67, 95% CI 0.58 to 4.77; 206 participants; low-certainty evidence). This study did not measure tolerability. Post-intervention, compared to placebo, antidepressants may be beneficial in preventing depression in adults with different types of long-term physical conditions, but the evidence is very uncertain (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.49; 814 participants; nine studies; I2 = 0%; very low-certainty evidence). There may be little to no difference between groups both immediately and at six months follow-up (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.08 to 2.46; 23 participants; one study; very low-certainty evidence) as well as at six to 12 months follow-up (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.23 to 2.82; 233 participants; three studies; I2 = 49%; very low-certainty evidence). There was very low-certainty evidence from five studies regarding the tolerability of the pharmacological intervention. A total of 669 adverse events were observed in 316 participants from the pharmacological intervention group, and 610 adverse events from 311 participants in the placebo group. There was very low-certainty evidence that drop-outs due to adverse events may be less frequent in the placebo group (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.07 to 3.89; 561 participants; five studies; I2 = 0%). There was also very low-certainty evidence that drop-outs due to any cause may not differ between groups either post-intervention (OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.73; 962 participants; nine studies; I2 = 28%), or at six to 12 months (OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.86; 327 participants; three studies; I2 = 0%). Based on evidence of very low certainty, our results may indicate the benefit of pharmacological interventions, during or directly after preventive treatment. Few trials examined short-term outcomes up to six months, nor the follow-up effects at six to 12 months, with studies suffering from great numbers of drop-outs and inconclusive results. Generalisation of results is limited as study populations and treatment regimes were very heterogeneous. Based on the results of this review, we conclude that for adults with long-term physical conditions, there is only very uncertain evidence regarding the implementation of any primary preventive interventions (psychological/pharmacological) for depression.","People with long-term illness or other physical health conditions have a higher risk than other people of developing depression. This can reduce their quality of life. Depression is characterised by symptoms such as low mood, feelings of hopelessness, loss of interest in things that once gave pleasure, and other symptoms, as well as sleep disturbances. People with long-term physical conditions who develop depression are more likely to worsen in their illnesses and are more likely to die. Therefore, preventing depression in people with long-term physical conditions should be an important goal in healthcare. We wanted to know whether standard interventions for treating depression (i.e. psychological treatments and antidepressant drugs) can also safely be used to prevent the onset of an depressive episode in those adults at high risk for depression due to their long-term physical condition, but who do not yet show depressive symptoms. We also wanted to know whether these interventions worked in preventing recurrent depression, in those patients with long-term physical conditions who had a history of depression. First, we searched the medical literature for randomised controlled studies (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups). This type of study provides the most robust evidence about the effects of a treatment. We then compared the results, and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we assessed how certain the evidence was. To do this, we considered factors such as the way studies were conducted, study sizes, and consistency of findings across studies. Based on our assessments, we categorised the evidence as being of very low, low, moderate or high certainty. Medical and mental health care providers (including physicians and psychologists) and pharmacists, as well as adults with long-term physical conditions, their relatives and care-givers. This review includes 11 trials comparing a psychological intervention (problem-solving therapy) to treatment as usual; or comparing pharmacological antidepressant interventions (citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline, fluoxetine/nortriptyline, milnacipran, or melatonin) to placebo. For the psychological intervention, we found only one trial, including 194 people with age-related macular degeneration (an eye disease). For pharmacological interventions, we included 10 trials comprising 1009 people. Due to some participants not completing the studies, we could only analyse data for 837 participants. Our analyses show that people with long-term physical conditions may be less likely to develop depression during treatment with problem solving therapy, or with different types of antidepressants. However, these interventions appear to be beneficial only during treatment. Three to 12 months after treatment, there was no significant difference in onset of depression between the groups that had the interventions and those that did not. Therefore, preventive interventions might be effective in preventing depression onset only for the duration of the intervention. Our conclusions are based on evidence of very low certainty. In addition, there is not enough adequate information on the tolerability (unpleasant but generally medically less important adverse events due to the intervention, e.g. dry mouth) and acceptability (willingness to go through with the intervention even in the presence of adverse events) of these treatments. The interventions may be unsafe, irrespective of their potential to prevent depression.",1119,major depression; disability; co-morbidity; primary prevention; tertiary prevention; depressive episodes; psychological interventions; pharmacological interventions; antidepressants; very low-certainty evidence,"Based on the summary, how valid is it to generalize the study findings to all adults with long-term physical conditions?",What are the main reasons for attempting to prevent depression in people with long-term physical conditions?,Select the items that are animals,How might the onset of depression affect people with long-term physical conditions?,Which interventions were assessed for preventing depression in the study?,"Highly valid, as the study included a large diverse cohort.; Limited validity due to varied physical conditions represented.; Invalid, as the study focused solely on specific conditions like cancer and stroke.",Limited validity due to varied physical conditions represented.,To reduce the risk of developing depression; To increase healthcare costs; To prevent worsening of physical illnesses,To reduce the risk of developing depression; To prevent worsening of physical illnesses,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,It may improve their quality of life; It may increase the risk of mortality; It may decrease adherence to their treatment,It may increase the risk of mortality; It may decrease adherence to their treatment,Psychological interventions; Dietary supplements; Pharmacological interventions,Psychological interventions; Pharmacological interventions
5db0a97f127d4000117cdfa0,finetuned_5,Prophylactic antibiotic therapy for people with chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD),"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; including chronic bronchitis and emphysema) is a chronic respiratory condition characterised by shortness of breath, cough and recurrent exacerbations. Long-term antibiotic use may reduce both bacterial load and inflammation in the airways. Studies have shown a reduction of exacerbations with antibiotics in comparison to placebo in people with COPD, but there are concerns about antibiotic resistance and safety. To compare the safety and efficacy of different classes of antibiotics (continuous, intermittent or pulsed) for prophylaxis of exacerbations in patients with COPD.
We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Trials Register and bibliographies of relevant studies. The latest literature search was conducted on 6 February 2019.
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were selected that compared one prophylactic antibiotic with another in patients with COPD.
We used the standard Cochrane methods. Two independent review authors selected trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Discrepancies were resolved by involving a third review author.
We included two RCTs, both published in 2015 involving a total of 391 participants with treatment duration of 12 to 13 weeks. One RCT compared a quinolone (moxifloxacin pulsed, for 5 days every 4 weeks), with a tetracycline (doxycycline continuous) or a macrolide (azithromycin intermittent). The second RCT compared a tetracycline (doxycycline continuous) plus a macrolide (roxithromycin continuous), with roxithromycin (continuous) alone. The trials recruited participants with a mean age of 68 years, with moderate-severity COPD. Both trials included participants who had between two and five exacerbations in the previous one to two years. In one trial, 17% of patients had previously been using inhaled corticosteroids. In the other study, all patients were positive for Chlamydophila pneumoniae (C pneumoniae). Overall, we judged the evidence presented to be of very low-certainty, mainly due to imprecision, but we also had concerns about indirectness and methodological quality of the included studies. The primary outcome measures for this review included exacerbations, quality of life, drug resistance and serious adverse events. Macrolide + tetracycline versus macrolide There was no clear difference between treatments in improvement in quality of life as assessed by the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ). The CRQ scale ranges from 0 to 10 and higher scores on the scale indicate better quality of life. CRQ sub-scales for dyspnoea (mean difference (MD) 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.84 to 2.00; 187 participants; very low-certainty evidence), fatigue (MD 0.02, 95% CI -1.08 to 1.12; 187 participants; very low-certainty evidence), emotional function (MD -0.37, 95% CI -1.74 to 1.00; 187 participants; very low-certainty evidence), or mastery (MD -0.79, 95% CI -1.86 to 0.28; 187 participants; very low-certainty evidence) at 12 weeks. For serious adverse events, it was uncertain if there was a difference between combined roxithromycin and doxycycline versus roxithromycin alone at 48 weeks follow-up after active treatment of 12 weeks (odds ratio (OR) 1.00, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.93; 198 participants; very low-certainty evidence). There were five deaths reported in the combined treatment arm, versus three in the single treatment arm at 48 weeks follow-up after active treatment of 12 weeks (OR 1.63, 95% CI 0.38 to 7.02; 198 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Quinolone versus tetracycline There was no clear difference between moxifloxacin and doxycycline for the number of participants experiencing one or more exacerbations (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.38; 50 participants, very low-certainty evidence) at 13 weeks. There were no serious adverse events or deaths reported in either treatment groups. We did not identify any evidence for our other primary outcomes. Quinolone versus macrolide There was no clear difference between moxifloxacin and azithromycin for the number of participants experiencing one or more exacerbations (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.32 to 3.10; 50 participants; very low-certainty evidence) at 13 weeks. There were no serious adverse events or deaths reported in either treatment groups. We did not identify any evidence for our other primary outcomes. Marcolide versus tetracycline There was no clear difference between azithromycin and doxycycline for the number of participants experiencing one or more exacerbations (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.38; 50 participants; very low-certainty evidence) at 13 weeks. There were no serious adverse events or deaths reported in either treatment groups. We did not identify any evidence for our other primary outcomes. We did not find head-to-head evidence for impact of antibiotics on drug resistance. It is not clear from the evidence included in this review whether there is a difference in efficacy or safety between different classes or regimens of prophylactic antibiotic, given for 12 to 13 weeks to people with COPD. Whilst no head-to-head comparisons of antibiotic resistance were identified, concerns about this continue. The sample size in this review is small and both included studies are of short duration. Thus, there is considerable uncertainty in effects observed and the effects of different prophylactic antibiotics requires further research.","COPD is a common condition caused mainly by smoking and can lead to long-term breathing problems. Symptoms include shortness of breath, and cough with sputum production due to airways and lung damage. Infection can trigger severe symptoms, with breathing becoming worse and increased cough and sputum. This is more commonly known as an exacerbation or 'flare-up' which can cause further damage to lung function. Frequent exacerbations can lead to hospital admissions, reduced quality of life, and increase the risk of death.
We wanted to know whether one preventative antibiotic was better than another preventative antibiotic in reducing exacerbations, and improving quality of life for people with COPD.
We found two randomised trials, including 391 people with COPD. The participants had an average age of 68 years. The first study included three groups of COPD patients taking either moxifloxacin (daily for 5 days every 4 weeks), doxycycline (daily for 13 weeks) or azithromycin (3 times per week for 13 weeks). The second study investigated the use of doxycycline (daily) in addition to roxithromycin (daily) for 12 weeks in COPD. Our main outcomes were number of exacerbations, quality of life, serious side effects (known as 'adverse events') and antibiotic resistance.
Overall, we were unable to determine any difference between one antibiotic compared with each other in improving the main outcomes we measured.
We were unclear whether one antibiotic was better or worse than another in terms of reducing exacerbations or improving quality of life. Neither of the studies reported a comparison between antibiotics for drug resistance.
In one study lasting 13 weeks we found no serious side effects of taking moxifloxacin, azithromycin or doxycycline, and no deaths were reported. In the other study, very similar numbers of people experienced serious side effects in both the combined antibiotic and single antibiotic treatment groups after 12 weeks of treatment and 48 weeks of follow-up. However, the numbers were small so we are not sure if one treatment option may cause more side effects than the other. In the same study, five people in the combined treatment group died, compared to three people in the single treatment group. Again, these numbers are too small to draw any conclusions.
We were very uncertain about the results due to finding only two small studies that gave people with COPD antibiotics for only 12 or 13 weeks. The studies only looked at four different antibiotics and did not measure all the things we were interested in.",1080,Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; exacerbations; moxifloxacin; doxycycline; azithromycin; roxithromycin; inhaled corticosteroids; Chlamydophila pneumoniae; adverse events; antibiotic resistance,"If no evidence for a single advantageous antibiotic is proven, what could be a reason to continue researching different antibiotics in COPD?",What is the primary motivation of the study regarding COPD management?,Select all of the following that are colors,Summarize the conclusion about antibiotic efficacy mentioned in the summary.,Describe the overall certainty of the study's results.,To explore variations in individual patient responses.; To eliminate the need for antibiotics in COPD management.; To investigate impacts on disease progression not yet identified.,To explore variations in individual patient responses.; To investigate impacts on disease progression not yet identified.,To find a clear link between antibiotic use and increased lung function.; To compare the effectiveness of different antibiotics in preventing exacerbations.; To determine the impact of COPD on heart disease.,To compare the effectiveness of different antibiotics in preventing exacerbations.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,One preventative antibiotic was significantly better than others in reducing exacerbations.; No clear difference was determined between antibiotics in improving outcomes.; Macrolides were shown to be the most effective.,No clear difference was determined between antibiotics in improving outcomes.,Highly certain due to large sample size.; Very uncertain due to limited sample size and duration.; Moderately certain with strong evidence.,Very uncertain due to limited sample size and duration.
5db0a97f127d4000117cdfa0,finetuned_6,How accurate are alternative laboratory-based molecular tests (to RT-PCR with prior RNA extraction/purification) for identifying people infected by SARS-CoV-2?,"Diagnosing people with a SARS-CoV-2 infection played a critical role in managing the COVID-19 pandemic and remains a priority for the transition to long-term management of COVID-19. Initial shortages of extraction and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) reagents impaired the desired upscaling of testing in many countries, which led to the search for alternatives to RNA extraction/purification and RT-PCR testing. Reference standard methods for diagnosing the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection rely primarily on real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Alternatives to RT-PCR could, if sufficiently accurate, have a positive impact by expanding the range of diagnostic tools available for the timely identification of people infected by SARS-CoV-2, access to testing and the use of resources. We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of alternative (to RT-PCR assays) laboratory-based molecular tests for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection. We searched the COVID-19 Open Access Project living evidence database from the University of Bern until 30 September 2020 and the WHO COVID-19 Research Database until 31 October 2022, with no language restrictions. We included studies of people with suspected or known SARS-CoV-2 infection, or where tests were used to screen for infection, and studies evaluating commercially developed laboratory-based molecular tests for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection considered as alternatives to RT-PCR testing, and we included all reference standards to define the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2, including RT-PCR tests and established clinical diagnostic criteria. Two authors independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and applicability using the QUADAS-2 tool. We presented sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals for each test using paired forest plots and summarised results using average sensitivity and specificity with a bivariate random-effects meta-analysis, illustrating the findings per index test category and assay brand compared to the WHO's acceptable sensitivity and specificity thresholds for nucleic acid tests. We included data from 64 studies reporting 94 cohorts of participants and 105 index test evaluations, with 74,753 samples and 7517 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases. We did not identify any published or preprint reports of accuracy for a considerable number of commercially produced NAAT assays. Most cohorts were judged at unclear or high risk of bias in more than three QUADAS-2 domains; around half were at high risk of selection bias because of recruitment based on COVID status; and three quarters were at high risk of bias in the reference standard domain due to reliance on a single RT-PCR result or unclear diagnostic timing, missing results, or absent participant flow diagrams. For test categories with four or more evaluations allowing summary estimates, RT-PCR assays designed to omit/adapt RNA extraction/purification had average sensitivity of 95.1% (95% CI 91.1% to 97.3%) and specificity of 99.7% (95% CI 98.5% to 99.9%; 27 evaluations, 2834 samples and 1178 cases); RT-LAMP assays had average sensitivity of 88.4% (95% CI 83.1% to 92.2%) and specificity of 99.7% (95% CI 98.7% to 99.9%; 24 evaluations, 29,496 samples and 2255 cases); TMA assays had average sensitivity of 97.6% (95% CI 95.2% to 98.8%) and specificity of 99.4% (95% CI 94.9% to 99.9%; 14 evaluations, 2196 samples and 942 cases); digital PCR assays had average sensitivity of 98.5% (95% CI 95.2% to 99.5%) and specificity of 91.4% (95% CI 60.4% to 98.7%; 5 evaluations, 703 samples and 354 cases); RT-LAMP assays omitting/adapting RNA extraction had average sensitivity of 73.1% (95% CI 58.4% to 84%) and specificity of 100% (95% CI 98% to 100%; 24 evaluations, 14,342 samples and 1502 cases). Only two index categories fulfilled WHO-acceptable requirements: RT-PCR assays designed to omit/adapt RNA extraction/purification and TMA assays. At 5% prevalence in a cohort of 1000 people, the positive predictive value of RT-PCR assays omitting/adapting extraction is 94%, with three false positives among 51 positive results and about two missed cases; for TMA assays, positive predictive value is 89%, with six false positives among 55 positive results and around one missed case. Alternative laboratory-based molecular tests aim to enhance testing capacity by reducing time, steps, and resource requirements. Several technologies with potential advantages have not been evaluated or were assessed by few low-quality studies, so performance remains undetermined. Only RT-PCR assays designed to omit/adapt RNA extraction/purification and TMA assays fulfil WHO accuracy standards and may be suitable alternatives when RT-PCR is inaccessible. However, findings must be interpreted with caution due to limitations, including reliance on retrospective samples without symptom information, dominant representation of specific high-performing brands (21/26 and 12/14 studies), and methodological weaknesses. Although we used comprehensive searches and broad inclusion criteria, further research is needed to evaluate alternative COVID-19 tests and their role in pandemic management.","Laboratory-based molecular assays (tests) aim to confirm or rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection in people. Alternatives to RT-PCR assays have been developed to minimise the steps needed to process samples in the laboratory or use fewer resources to obtain the same valid results. For this review, we focus on tests commercially developed by a manufacturer, providing instructions for their professional use. People with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection should know if they are infected to self-isolate, receive treatment, and inform close contacts. Failure to detect SARS-CoV-2 when it is present risks spreading infection and results in missed opportunities for prevention. Diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection when it is not present may lead to unnecessary self-isolation and testing of close contacts. Currently, testing to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection relies on a laboratory molecular test called RT-PCR. This requires specialist equipment and can take 24 hours to produce a result. If assays that take less time or use readily available resources were sufficiently accurate to replace RT-PCR testing, this could increase the number of tests that could be done, allow faster diagnosis and enable people to take appropriate action more quickly. We wanted to know whether commercially developed, alternative laboratory-based molecular tests are accurate enough to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to RT-PCR. We looked for studies investigating these tests in people (or samples) that were also tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection using RT-PCR which modified RT-PCR by removing or altering components of this testing process. We included 105 evaluations evaluating alternatives to RT-PCR in the review. The main results are based on 74,753 samples, and SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed in 7517 of these samples. Most evaluations (27/105) concerned various test types specifically designed to omit/adapt RNA extraction/purification. Twenty-four of 105 evaluations concerned various test types operating at one temperature (isothermal tests) rather than cycling through different temperatures. Twenty-four of 105 evaluations were concerned with various test types that combined these two alternative approaches. Only tests specifically designed to omit/adapt RNA extraction/purification and TMA assays with RNA extraction (a type of isothermal test) met WHO-acceptable standards for confirming and ruling out SARS-CoV-2. For illustration, the results of these studies indicate that in a group of 1000 people, 50 of whom (5%) actually have SARS-CoV-2: for tests specifically designed to omit/adapt RNA extraction/purification, 51 people would test positive for SARS-CoV-2, of these, three people (6%) would not have SARS-CoV-2 (false-positive result), and 949 people would test negative for SARS-CoV-2, of these, two people (0.2%) would actually have SARS-CoV-2 (false-negative result); for TMA tests with RNA extraction, 55 people would test positive for SARS-CoV-2, of these, six people (10%) would not have SARS-CoV-2 (false-positive result), and 945 people would test negative for SARS-CoV-2, of these, one person (0.1%) would actually have SARS-CoV-2 (false-negative result). Most included studies did not provide information on participants who underwent testing, such as whether they had symptoms or were close contacts of a SARS-CoV-2 case. We also had concerns about the method of recruiting participants for the majority of included studies, which may have resulted in an overestimation of the accuracy of these methods. In addition, the method used to determine whether individuals did not have SARS-CoV-2 infection was not considered reliable for most studies, which may have resulted in underestimating the accuracy of these methods. Some studies did not follow the manufacturers' instructions for using the test. Results from different test brands using the same technique varied. The studies included in this review suggest that two laboratory-based molecular tests might be accurate enough to replace or supplement RT-PCR tests with prior RNA extraction/purification for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection: RT-PCR tests developed to omit or adapt RNA extraction or purification and TMA isothermal tests (retaining an RNA extraction step). Other alternative tests to RT-PCR were assessed just by a few studies of limited methodological quality, and their performance should be evaluated by additional studies. Furthermore, data in these studies mostly relied on samples acquired in the past (compared to current or future samples), thus further evaluation of these tests in real clinical practice scenarios is required. Also, decisions on the optimal test for a specific setting will be driven not only by diagnostic accuracy, but also by other factors such as test complexity, time to result, acceptability to those being tested, and the setting in which the tests are to be used.",1112,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To assess the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions in the prevention of physical, mental and social disability following traumatic physical injury.
The search was not restricted by date, language or publication status. We searched the following electronic databases; Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 1), MEDLINE (Ovid SP), EMBASE (Ovid SP), PsycINFO (Ovid SP), Controlled Trials metaRegister (www.controlled-trials.com), AMED (Allied & Complementary Medicine), ISI Web of Science: Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI), PubMed. We also screened the reference lists of all selected papers and contacted authors of relevant studies. The latest search for trials was in February 2008.
Randomised controlled trials that consider one or more defined psychosocial interventions for the prevention of physical disability, mental health problems or reduced social functioning as a result of traumatic physical injury. We excluded studies that included patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Two authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of search results, reviewed the full text of potentially relevant studies, independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. We included five studies, involving 756 participants. Three studies assessed the effect of brief psychological therapies, one assessed the impact of a self-help booklet, and one the effect of collaborative care. The disparate nature of the trials covering different patient populations, interventions and outcomes meant that it was not possible to pool data meaningfully across studies. There was no evidence of a protective effect of brief psychological therapy or educational booklets on preventing disability. There was evidence from one trial of a reduction in both post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depressive symptoms one month after injury in those who received a collaborative care intervention combined with a brief psycho-educational intervention, however this was not retained at follow up. Overall mental health status was the only disability outcome affected by any intervention. In three trials the psychosocial intervention had a detrimental effect on the mental health status of patients. This review provides no convincing evidence of the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for the prevention of disability following traumatic physical injury. Taken together, our findings cannot be considered as supporting the provision of psychosocial interventions to prevent aspects of disability arising from physical injury. However, these conclusions are based on a small number of disparate trials with small to moderate sample sizes and are therefore necessarily cautious. More research, using larger sample sizes, and similar interventions and patient populations to enable pooling of results, is needed before these findings can be confirmed.","Traumatic physical injury such as that resulting from road traffic accidents, falls and fires can cause high levels of subsequent disability in the person affected. This may include physical disability as a result of the initial injury and subsequent complications, mental health problems such as depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a result of the trauma of the event which caused the injury and the resulting physical and social problems, and social problems such as loss of social life and unemployment. It is therefore important to evaluate interventions which seek to prevent these adverse secondary outcomes. Psychosocial interventions, which include psychological therapies such as interpersonal counselling and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), and social interventions such as befriending, social support and self-help advice, delivered soon after the injury, may help to prevent these problems.
This review identified five randomised controlled trials, involving 756 participants, which evaluated psychosocial interventions for the prevention of disability following traumatic injury. No convincing evidence was found supporting the efficacy of these interventions. In particular, self-help booklets and interpersonal therapies had no effect on preventing disability. There was some evidence that a more complex intervention involving collaborative care reduced symptoms of depression and PTSD in the short but not the medium term. There was evidence from three trials that psychosocial interventions had a detrimental effect on mental health. Taken together, our findings cannot be taken as supporting the provision of psychosocial interventions to prevent aspects of disability arising from physical injury. These results suggest that future interventions should focus on screening patients at risk of poor outcomes and only treating those who develop subsequent problems. However, the strength of these conclusions is limited by the small size and varied nature of many of the trials, which means that their results cannot be pooled.",1060,psychosocial interventions; traumatic physical injury; disabling sequelae; physical disability; mental health problems; social functioning; collaborative care; post-traumatic stress disorder; depressive symptoms; psycho-educational intervention,What types of disabilities can traumatic physical injury cause?,Identify the primary purpose of evaluating psychosocial interventions in the context of traumatic injuries.,Select all of the following that are colors,Which psychosocial intervention showed short-term efficacy in reducing depressive symptoms?,Explain the overall finding regarding the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions after a traumatic injury.,Physical and mental health problems; Improved social interactions; Increased employment opportunities,Physical and mental health problems,To prevent adverse secondary outcomes; To reduce the cost of medical treatments; To enhance physical strength,To prevent adverse secondary outcomes,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Collaborative care intervention; Self-help booklet; Interpersonal therapy,Collaborative care intervention,No convincing evidence supports their efficacy; Effective in preventing all types of disability; Significantly improved physical recovery,No convincing evidence supports their efficacy
59cf062758b71700019882d4,static_1,Exercise-based rehabilitation for coronary heart disease,"Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the most common cause of death globally. However, with falling CHD mortality rates, an increasing number of people living with CHD may need support to manage their symptoms and prognosis. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) aims to improve the health and outcomes of people with CHD. This is an update of a Cochrane Review previously published in 2016. To assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of exercise-based CR (exercise training alone or in combination with psychosocial or educational interventions) compared with 'no exercise' control, on mortality, morbidity and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in people with CHD. We updated searches from the previous Cochrane Review, by searching CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two other databases in September 2020. We also searched two clinical trials registers in June 2021. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of exercise-based interventions with at least six months follow-up, compared with 'no exercise' control. The study population comprised adult men and women who have had a myocardial infarction (MI), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), or have angina pectoris, or coronary artery disease. We screened all identified references, extracted data and assessed risk of bias according to Cochrane methods. We stratified meta-analysis by duration of follow-up: short-term (6 to 12 months); medium-term (> 12 to 36 months); and long-term (> 3 years), and used meta-regression to explore potential treatment effect modifiers. We used GRADE for primary outcomes at 6 to 12 months (the most common follow-up time point). This review included 85 trials which randomised 23,430 people with CHD. This latest update identified 22 new trials (7795 participants). The population included predominantly post-MI and post-revascularisation patients, with a mean age ranging from 47 to 77 years. In the last decade, the median percentage of women with CHD has increased from 11% to 17%, but females still account for a similarly small percentage of participants recruited overall (< 15%). Twenty-one of the included trials were performed in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Overall trial reporting was poor, although there was evidence of an improvement in quality over the last decade. The median longest follow-up time was 12 months (range 6 months to 19 years). At short-term follow-up (6 to 12 months), exercise-based CR likely results in a slight reduction in all-cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 1.04; 25 trials; moderate certainty evidence), a large reduction in MI (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.93; 22 trials; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 75, 95% CI 47 to 298; high certainty evidence), and a large reduction in all-cause hospitalisation (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.77; 14 trials; NNTB 12, 95% CI 9 to 21; moderate certainty evidence). Exercise-based CR likely results in little to no difference in risk of cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.14; 15 trials; moderate certainty evidence), CABG (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.27; 20 trials; high certainty evidence), and PCI (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.19; 13 trials; moderate certainty evidence) up to 12 months' follow-up. We are uncertain about the effects of exercise-based CR on cardiovascular hospitalisation, with a wide confidence interval including considerable benefit as well as harm (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.59; low certainty evidence). There was evidence of substantial heterogeneity across trials for cardiovascular hospitalisations ( I²= 53%), and of small study bias for all-cause hospitalisation, but not for all other outcomes. At medium-term follow-up, although there may be little to no difference in all-cause mortality (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.02; 15 trials), MI (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.27; 12 trials), PCI (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.35; 6 trials), CABG (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.23; 9 trials), and all-cause hospitalisation (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.03; 9 trials), a large reduction in cardiovascular mortality was found (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.93; 5 trials). Evidence is uncertain for difference in risk of cardiovascular hospitalisation (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.12; 3 trials). At long-term follow-up, although there may be little to no difference in all-cause mortality (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.10), exercise-based CR may result in a large reduction in cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.78; 8 trials) and MI (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.90; 10 trials). Evidence is uncertain for CABG (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.27; 4 trials), and PCI (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.20; 3 trials). Meta-regression showed benefits in outcomes were independent of CHD case mix, type of CR, exercise dose, follow-up length, publication year, CR setting, study location, sample size or risk of bias. There was evidence that exercise-based CR may slightly increase HRQoL across several subscales (SF-36 mental component, physical functioning, physical performance, general health, vitality, social functioning and mental health scores) up to 12 months' follow-up; however, these may not be clinically important differences. The eight trial-based economic evaluation studies showed exercise-based CR to be a potentially cost-effective use of resources in terms of gain in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). This updated Cochrane Review supports the conclusions of the previous version, that exercise-based CR provides important benefits to people with CHD, including reduced risk of MI, a likely small reduction in all-cause mortality, and a large reduction in all-cause hospitalisation, along with associated healthcare costs, and improved HRQoL up to 12 months' follow-up. Over longer-term follow-up, benefits may include reductions in cardiovascular mortality and MI. In the last decade, trials were more likely to include females, and be undertaken in LMICs, increasing the generalisability of findings. Well-designed, adequately-reported RCTs of CR in people with CHD more representative of usual clinical practice are still needed. Trials should explicitly report clinical outcomes, including mortality and hospital admissions, and include validated HRQoL outcome measures, especially over longer-term follow-up, and assess costs and cost-effectiveness.","Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the single most common cause of death globally. However, with falling CHD mortality rates, an increasing number of people live with CHD and may need support to manage their symptoms (such as angina, shortness of breath with physical activity, and fatigue) and reduce the chances of future problems, such as heart attacks. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (exercise training alone or in combination with psychological or educational interventions) aims to improve the health and outcomes of people with CHD. We searched the scientific literature for randomised controlled trials (experiments that randomly allocate participants to one of two or more treatment groups) looking at the effectiveness of exercise-based treatments compared with no exercise in people of all ages with CHD. The evidence is current to September 2020. This latest update identified an additional 22 trials (7795 participants). We included a total of 85 trials that studied 23,430 people with CHD, predominantly heart attack survivors and those who had undergone heart bypass surgery or angioplasty (a procedure which widens narrowed or obstructed arteries or veins). Thirty-eight (45%) of the trials involved exercise-only interventions and 47 (55%) involved interventions with exercise plus other components. The type of exercise most often included was stationary cycling, walking or circuit training. Twenty-one (25%) of the interventions were delivered in the participants' homes. The findings of this update are consistent with the previous (2016) version of this Cochrane Review, and show important benefits of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation that include a reduction in the risk of death due to any cause, heart attack, and hospital admission, and improvements in health-related quality of life, compared with not undertaking exercise. A small body of economic evidence was identified, indicating exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation to be cost-effective. Many of the studies identified in this current update were undertaken in low- and middle-income countries, which increases the generalisability of our results to these settings where levels of CHD are high and continue to increase. Although the reporting of methods has improved in recent trials, lack of reporting key methodological aspects made it difficult to assess the overall methodological quality and risk of possible bias of the evidence.",1031,Coronary heart disease; cardiac rehabilitation; myocardial infarction; coronary artery bypass graft; percutaneous coronary intervention; angina pectoris; health-related quality of life; quality-adjusted life years; psychosocial interventions; revascularisation,How do the latest findings on exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation enhance the understanding of its benefits for people with CHD?,What is the primary aim of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) in people with CHD?,Select the items that are animals,How does exercise-based CR affect the risk of hospital admission for those with CHD?,What type of exercise is most commonly included in exercise-based CR?,They demonstrate a reduction in cardiovascular mortality over long-term follow-up.; They highlight the lack of effectiveness in reducing hospital admissions.; They confirm improvements in health-related quality of life within 12 months.,They demonstrate a reduction in cardiovascular mortality over long-term follow-up.; They confirm improvements in health-related quality of life within 12 months.,To improve health and outcomes; To increase hospital admissions; To eliminate the need for medication,To improve health and outcomes,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,Reduces hospital admission risk; Increases hospital admission risk; Has no impact on hospital admission risk,Reduces hospital admission risk,Swimming; Stationary cycling; Weightlifting,Stationary cycling
59cf062758b71700019882d4,static_2,Treatments to reduce body temperature to 35C in people who are in hospital after a traumatic brain injury,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and disability, with an estimated 5.5 million people experiencing severe TBI worldwide every year. Observational clinical studies suggest a link between raised body temperature and unfavourable outcomes, though findings are inconsistent. Preclinical models indicate that reducing temperature to 35C to 37.5C may improve biological outcomes compared to deeper cooling (33C). It remains unknown whether reducing body temperature to 35C in people admitted to hospital with TBI is beneficial, neutral, or harmful. This review updates a previous version published in 2014. We aimed to assess the effects of pharmacological or physical interventions designed to reduce body temperature to 35C in adults and children hospitalised after TBI. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, PubMed, clinical trial registers, grey literature, reference lists, and forward citations up to 28 November 2019. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving participants of any age admitted after TBI and receiving interventions intended to lower body temperature within the target range, including medications (paracetamol, NSAIDs) or physical cooling methods (surface cooling devices, bedside fans, cooled intravenous fluids). Eligible comparators were placebo or usual care. Two authors independently assessed studies, extracted data, and evaluated risk of bias, using GRADE to assess certainty of evidence. Only one RCT with 41 adult participants, conducted in two Australian intensive care units, met the criteria. Participants received intravenous paracetamol (1 g every four hours for 72 hours) or a matched placebo. We were uncertain whether paracetamol influenced 28-day mortality (risk ratio 2.86, 95% CI 0.32 to 25.24). The certainty of evidence was very low due to imprecision (small sample size) and selective reporting concerns, although other risks of bias were low. The study did not report the primary outcome of poor outcome at follow-up (death or dependency) or any secondary outcomes of interest, including intracranial or extracranial haemorrhage, abnormal intracranial pressure, or pneumonia or other serious infections. We found one additional completed trial of a physical intervention (advanced fever control using a surface cooling device versus standard fever control in 12 participants), but it was published only as an abstract with insufficient details for inclusion; it is listed as awaiting classification pending further information. Four ongoing trials may contribute data to future updates if they report relevant outcomes and provide separate results for participants with TBI when mixed populations are included. In conclusion, one small study contributed very low-certainty evidence on mortality. Overall uncertainty is driven by extremely limited research on interventions aimed at reducing body temperature to 35C after TBI. More research evaluating both pharmacological and physical interventions is needed. Future studies should include outcomes important to patients, such as side effects (e.g., nausea, vomiting) and discomfort caused by cooling therapies.","Traumatic brain injury occurs when direct force to the headsuch as from a road traffic accident or a fall causes damage to the brain. It is a major global health problem, affecting about 5.5 million people each year. Injury occurs in two stages: first at the moment of impact, and then over the following hours to weeks as secondary damage develops. Treatment aims to limit this secondary damage. Some evidence suggests that people with normal body temperature after injury may have better outcomes than those with elevated temperatures. This review examined whether medicines or non-drug physical cooling methods that reduce body temperature to between 35C improve outcomes for adults or children hospitalized after traumatic brain injury. We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs)the most reliable type of evidence up to 28 November 2019. Only one small RCT with 41 participants was found. It compared intravenous paracetamol, given for 72 hours, with an intravenous salt solution made to look identical. No published trials assessed other medicines or physical cooling methods such as cooling blankets, ice, fans, or cooled fluids. One very small study of physical cooling was identified but lacked enough information for inclusion, and four ongoing studies may provide future evidence. Some of these include mixed types of brain injury, and we will only be able to use them if they report traumatic brain injury results separately. We were uncertain whether paracetamol reduced deaths within 28 days because the study was very small and did not originally plan to report mortality. It also did not report any of our key outcomes, such as poor functional outcome (death or dependency), serious bleeding inside or outside the brain, raised intracranial pressure, pneumonia, or other infections. Although the study methods were generally sound, the lack of pre-specified reporting increased the risk of bias. With only one small study, the certainty of the evidence was very low, meaning the true effects may be very different from what was reported. Overall, we remain uncertain whether medicines or physical cooling treatments that lower body temperature to 35C benefit people in hospital after traumatic brain injury. More and larger studies are needed, and future updates will assess side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and discomfort, which we hope ongoing and future research will report.",1056,Traumatic brain injury; pharmacological interventions; physical cooling methods; certainty of evidence; imprecision; intracranial pressure; extracranial haemorrhage; pneumonia; advanced fever control,What were the motivations for the study's focus on cooling treatments for TBI?,Which factors contributed to the uncertainty of the study results on paracetamol?,Select all of the following that are colors,"Based on the study, what can be concluded about the use of cooling methods in reducing TBI mortality rates?",Explain the main goal of the study in your own words.,Elevated body temperatures suggest potentially worse outcomes for TBI patients.; Normal body temperature is universally accepted to improve brain injury outcomes.; Cooling treatments have been consistently proven in other unrelated medical contexts.,Elevated body temperatures suggest potentially worse outcomes for TBI patients.,The study used a too short duration of treatment.; The small sample size and lack of pre-planned mortality reporting.; The study confirmed that all key outcomes were reported comprehensively.,The small sample size and lack of pre-planned mortality reporting.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,The study provides strong evidence that cooling methods reduce mortality.; Cooling methods' impact on mortality is uncertain due to the study's limited scope.; Mortality rates increase significantly with the use of cooling methods.,Cooling methods' impact on mortality is uncertain due to the study's limited scope.,To determine if cooling to 35-37.5Â°C improves outcomes after TBI; To establish the best surgical intervention for TBI; To identify genetic markers of TBI,To determine if cooling to 35-37.5Â°C improves outcomes after TBI
59cf062758b71700019882d4,static_2,Are services organised to deliver care for people with atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat) better than usual (routine) care?,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an increasingly prevalent heart rhythm condition in adults. It is considered a common cardiovascular condition with complex clinical management. The increasing prevalence and complexity in management underpin the need to adapt and innovate in the delivery of care for people living with AF. There is a need to systematically examine the optimal way in which clinical services are organised to deliver evidence-based care for people with AF. Recommended approaches include collaborative, organised multidisciplinary, and virtual (or eHealth/mHealth) models of care.
To assess the effects of clinical service organisation for AF versus usual care for people with all types of AF.
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL to October 2022. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP to April 2023. We applied no restrictions on date, publication status, or language.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), published as full texts and as abstract only, involving adults (? 18 years) with a diagnosis of any type of AF. We included RCTs comparing organised clinical service, disease-specific management interventions (including e-health models of care) for people with AF that were multicomponent and multidisciplinary in nature to usual care.
Three review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data from the included studies. We calculated risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous data and mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using random-effects analyses. We then calculated the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) using the RR. We performed sensitivity analyses by only including studies with a low risk of selection and attrition bias. We assessed heterogeneity using the I² statistic and the certainty of the evidence according to GRADE. The primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and all-cause hospitalisation. The secondary outcomes were cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular hospitalisation, AF-related emergency department visits, thromboembolic complications, minor cerebrovascular bleeding events, major cerebrovascular bleeding events, all bleeding events, AF-related quality of life, AF symptom burden, cost of intervention, and length of hospital stay.
We included 8 studies (8205 participants) of collaborative, multidisciplinary care, or virtual care for people with AF. The average age of participants ranged from 60 to 73 years. The studies were conducted in China, the Netherlands, and Australia. The included studies involved either a nurse-led multidisciplinary approach (n = 4) or management using mHealth (n = 2) compared to usual care. Only six out of the eight included studies could be included in the meta-analysis (for all-cause mortality and all-cause hospitalisation, cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular hospitalisation, thromboembolic complications, and major bleeding), as quality of life was not assessed using a validated outcome measure specific for AF. We assessed the overall risk of bias as high, as all studies had at least one domain at unclear or high risk of bias rating for performance bias (blinding) in particular. Organised AF clinical services probably result in a large reduction in all-cause mortality (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.89; 5 studies, 4664 participants; moderate certainty evidence; 6-year NNTB 37) compared to usual care. However, organised AF clinical services probably make little to no difference to all-cause hospitalisation (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.02; 2 studies, 1340 participants; moderate certainty evidence; 2-year NNTB 101) and may not reduce cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.19; 5 studies, 4564 participants; low certainty evidence; 6-year NNTB 86) compared to usual care. Organised AF clinical services reduce cardiovascular hospitalisation (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.96; 3 studies, 3641 participants; high certainty evidence; 6-year NNTB 28) compared to usual care. Organised AF clinical services may have little to no effect on thromboembolic complications such as stroke (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.77; 5 studies, 4653 participants; low certainty evidence; 6-year NNTB 588) and major cerebrovascular bleeding events (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.97; 3 studies, 2964 participants; low certainty evidence; 6-year NNTB 556). None of the studies reported minor cerebrovascular events.
Moderate certainty evidence shows that organisation of clinical services for AF likely results in a large reduction in all-cause mortality, but probably makes little to no difference to all-cause hospitalisation compared to usual care. Organised AF clinical services may not reduce cardiovascular mortality, but do reduce cardiovascular hospitalisation compared to usual care. However, organised AF clinical services may make little to no difference to thromboembolic complications and major cerebrovascular events. None of the studies reported minor cerebrovascular events. Due to the limited number of studies, more research is required to compare different models of care organisation, including utilisation of mHealth. Appropriately powered trials are needed to confirm these findings and robustly examine the effect on inconclusive outcomes. The findings of this review underscore the importance of the co-ordination of care underpinned by collaborative multidisciplinary approaches and augmented by virtual care.","Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an irregular heartbeat that happens when the electrical signals in the heart fire quickly at the same time. This causes the heart to beat too fast or too slow, which can cause troubling symptoms and serious medical complications, including blood clots that can lead to stroke (where blood flow to the brain is blocked). Atrial fibrillation is treated with lifestyle changes, medication, and procedures, including surgery, to help prevent blood clots, control the heartbeat, or restore the heart's normal rhythm. Organised care services for AF involve: (i) providing care that is focused on improving people's care experiences, health outcomes, and quality of life; (ii) that is delivered by a team of healthcare providers from various fields of study working together; and (iii) that uses technology to support the integrated approach. Routine care is care provided as part of normal practice.
We wanted to find out if organised care services for AF were better than usual (routine) care in reducing death and hospital admission from all causes. We also wanted to find out if organised care services for AF were better than routine care in reducing heart-related death and hospital admissions, AF-related emergency department visits, complications such as stroke and mini-stroke, major and minor complications related to bleeding in the brain, AF-related quality of life, AF symptoms, length of hospital stay, and cost related to the services. We searched for studies comparing organised care services for AF to routine care in adults diagnosed with AF. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.
We found 8 studies involving a total of 8205 people with AF, with an average age of 60 to 73 years. The included studies were performed in China, the Netherlands, and Australia. All eight studies reported receiving individual grants or a combination of public funding and funding from industry. Compared to routine care, organised AF care services:
- prevent one death from all causes for every 37 patients treated and followed for six years;
- prevent one hospital admission from all causes for every 101 patients treated and followed for two years;
- prevent one heart-related death for every 86 patients treated and followed for six years; and
- prevent one heart-related hospital admission for every 28 patients treated and followed for six years; but
- may make little to no difference to complications such as stroke and mini-stroke (one complication prevented for every 588 patients treated and followed for six years) and major complications related to bleeding in the brain (one bleeding complication prevented for every 556 patients treated and followed for six years).
No study assessed minor complications related to bleeding in the brain.
Our confidence in the evidence for death and hospital admissions from all causes is only moderate because it is possible that some study participants were aware of which treatment they were getting, which could have influenced the results.
We have little confidence in the evidence for heart-related death because the ways treatment was delivered varied across studies, and it is possible that some study participants were aware of which treatment they were getting, which could have influenced the results. We are confident that organised care services for AF reduce heart-related hospital admissions.
We have little confidence in the evidence for complications and bleeding-related complications specifically because the ways treatment was delivered varied across studies, and it is possible that some study participants were aware of which treatment they were getting, which could have influenced the results.

59cf062758b71700019882d4,interactive_3,Degarelix for newly diagnosed advanced prostate cancer,"Degarelix is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist that leads to medical castration used to treat men with advanced or metastatic prostate cancer, or both. It is unclear how its effects compare to standard androgen suppression therapy. We assessed the effects of degarelix compared with standard androgen suppression therapy for men with advanced hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. We searched multiple databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, LILACS until September 2020), trial registries (until October 2020), and conference proceedings (until December 2020). We identified other potentially eligible trials by reference checking, citation searching, and contacting study authors. We included randomized controlled trials comparing degarelix with standard androgen suppression therapy for men with advanced prostate cancer. Three review authors independently classified studies and abstracted data from the included studies. The primary outcomes were overall survival and serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes were quality of life, cancer-specific survival, clinical progression, other adverse events, and biochemical progression. We used a random-effects model for meta-analyses and assessed the certainty of evidence for the main outcomes according to GRADE. We included 11 studies with a follow-up of between three and 14 months. We also identified five ongoing trials. Data to evaluate overall survival were not available. Degarelix may result in little to no difference in serious adverse events compared to standard androgen suppression therapy (risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 1.05; low-certainty evidence; 2750 participants). Based on 114 serious adverse events in the standard androgen suppression group, this corresponds to 23 fewer serious adverse events per 1000 participants (43 fewer to 6 more). We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations and imprecision. Degarelix likely results in little to no difference in quality of life assessed with a variety of validated questionnaires (standardized mean difference 0.06 higher, 95% CI 0.05 lower to 0.18 higher; moderate-certainty evidence; 2887 participants), with higher scores reflecting better quality of life. We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations. Data to evaluate cancer-specific survival were not available. The effects of degarelix on cardiovascular events are very uncertain (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.61; very low-certainty evidence; 80 participants). We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations, imprecision, and indirectness as this trial was conducted in a unique group of high-risk participants with pre-existing cardiovascular morbidities. Degarelix likely results in an increase in injection site pain (RR 15.68, 95% CI 7.41 to 33.17; moderate-certainty evidence; 2670 participants). Based on 30 participants per 1000 with injection site pain with standard androgen suppression therapy, this corresponds to 440 more injection site pains per 1000 participants (192 more to 965 more). We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations. We did not identify any relevant subgroup differences for different degarelix maintenance doses. We did not find trial evidence for overall survival or cancer-specific survival comparing degarelix to standard androgen suppression, but serious adverse events and quality of life may be similar between groups. The effects of degarelix on cardiovascular events are very uncertain as the only eligible study had limitations, was small with few events, and was conducted in a high-risk population. Degarelix likely results in an increase in injection site pain compared to standard androgen suppression therapy. Maximum follow-up of included studies was 14 months, which is short. There is a need for methodologically better designed and executed studies with long-term follow-up evaluating men with metastatic prostate cancer.","How does degarelix, a newer drug that treats prostate cancer by lowering male sex hormone levels, compare to existing medications for newly diagnosed advanced prostate cancer? There is no cure if prostate cancer has spread outside of the prostate gland to lymph nodes or to the bones. In such a situation, hormonal therapy that lowers levels of the male sex hormone testosterone can slow down cancer growth. Testosterone levels are regulated by complicated mechanisms that involve a hormone known as gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which is present in men at different levels at different times of the day. It is understood that giving men with prostate cancer high levels of medications that increase GnRH levels first raises testosterone levels, and then drops them to very low levels. These medications are commonly used to treat men with prostate cancer that has spread outside the prostate. Degarelix is a newer drug known as a GnRH antagonist, which blocks receptors in the brain and thereby lowers testosterone levels immediately. We included randomized controlled trials (studies in which participants are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) comparing degarelix and standard hormonal therapy in men with newly diagnosed advanced prostate cancer. The evidence is current to September 2020 for electronic databases, to October 2020 for trial registries, and to December 2020 for conference proceedings. We found 11 studies that were eligible for inclusion in the review, but none of these studies evaluated the risk of dying from any cause or dying from prostate cancer. There may be no difference between degarelix and standard hormonal therapy in serious unwanted effects and quality of life. The effects of degarelix on cardiovascular issues such as the risk of a heart attack or stroke are uncertain; while one study suggested that the risk may be reduced with degarelix, it had major issues, in particular that it was conducted in men at high risk for such problems. We found that degarelix therapy likely results in an increase in the occurrence of pain at the injection site. The certainty of evidence for the various outcomes ranged from moderate to very low. There is a need for additional, better designed studies to further understand the effects of degarelix for newly diagnosed advanced prostate cancer.",1024,Degarelix; gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist; androgen suppression therapy; metastatic prostate cancer; hormone-sensitive prostate cancer; overall survival; serious adverse events; quality of life; cancer-specific survival; cardiovascular events,How does the evidence regarding cardiovascular events influence the current understanding of degarelix compared to standard therapy?,What could improve the reliability of outcomes related to quality of life in future studies with degarelix?,Select all of the following that are fruits,How do the study's conclusions address the balance between serious adverse events and quality of life?,Which type of prostate cancer was the focus of the study comparing degarelix with standard therapy?,The evidence suggests a reduced risk with degarelix due to lower event rates in standard therapy.; The evidence is inconclusive due to study limitations and focus on high-risk populations.; The evidence supports degarelix as a preferable treatment for all patients because of fewer cardiac events.,The evidence is inconclusive due to study limitations and focus on high-risk populations.,Using a single standardized questionnaire for all studies.; Ensuring consistent data collection methods across studies.; Focusing on quality of life outcomes only in high-risk participant trials.,Ensuring consistent data collection methods across studies.,dog; blue; grape,grape,"The study concludes that there is little difference, suggesting similar benefit-risk profiles.; The conclusions indicate that degarelix has significantly fewer adverse events but similar quality of life.; It concludes that standard therapy provides better outcomes for quality of life but with more adverse events.","The study concludes that there is little difference, suggesting similar benefit-risk profiles.",Newly diagnosed advanced prostate cancer; Localized prostate cancer; Hormone-refractory prostate cancer,Newly diagnosed advanced prostate cancer
59cf062758b71700019882d4,interactive_4,What are the benefits and risks of cognitive rehabilitation for people with mild-to-moderate dementia?,"Cognitive impairments affect functional ability in people with dementia. Cognitive rehabilitation (CR) is a personalised, solution-focused approach that aims to enable people with mild-to-moderate dementia to manage everyday activities and maintain as much independence as possible. To evaluate the effects of CR on everyday functioning and other outcomes for people with mild-to-moderate dementia, and on outcomes for care partners. To identify and explore factors that may be associated with the efficacy of CR. We searched the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialised Register, which contains records from MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, LILACS, and other clinical trial databases, and grey literature sources. The most recent search was completed on 19 October 2022. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing CR with control conditions and reporting relevant outcomes for the person with dementia and/or the care partner. We extracted relevant data from published manuscripts and contacted trial authors if necessary. Within each of the comparisons, we pooled data for each outcome of interest and conducted inverse-variance, random-effects meta-analyses. We evaluated the certainty of the evidence using GRADEpro GDT. We identified six eligible RCTs published in English between 2010 and 2022, which together included 1702 participants. The mean age of participants ranged from 76 to 80 and the proportion of male participants was between 29.4% and 79.3%. Most participants, in the studies where the type of dementia was reported, had a diagnosis of Alzheimers disease (AD; n = 1002, 58.9% of the whole sample, 81.2% of the participants for whom the specific diagnosis was reported). Risk of bias in the individual studies was relatively low. The exception was a high risk of bias in relation to blinding of participants and practitioners, which is not usually feasible with psychosocial interventions. Our primary outcome of everyday functioning was operationalised in the included studies as goal attainment in relation to activities targeted in the intervention. For our main comparison of CR with usual care, we pooled data for goal attainment evaluated from three perspectives (self-rating of performance, informant rating of performance, and self-rating of satisfaction with performance) at end of treatment and at medium-term follow-up (3 to 12 months). We could also pool data at these time points for 20 and 19 secondary outcomes respectively. The review findings were strongly driven by one large, high-quality RCT. We found high-certainty evidence of large positive effects of CR on all three primary outcome perspectives at the end of treatment: participant self-ratings of goal attainment (standardised mean difference (SMD) 1.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.26 to 1.66; I2 = 0%; 3 RCTs, 501 participants), informant ratings of goal attainment (SMD 1.61, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.21; I2 = 41%; 3 RCTs, 476 participants), and self-ratings of satisfaction with goal attainment (SMD 1.31, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.54; I2 = 5%; 3 RCTs, 501 participants), relative to an inactive control condition. At medium-term follow-up, we found high-certainty evidence showing a large positive effect of CR on all three primary outcome perspectives: participant self-ratings of goal attainment (SMD 1.46, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.68; I2 = 0%; 2 RCTs, 432 participants), informant ratings of goal attainment (SMD 1.25, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.72; I2 = 29%; 3 RCTs, 446 participants), and self-ratings of satisfaction with goal attainment (SMD 1.19, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.66; I2 = 28%; 2 RCTs, 432 participants), relative to an inactive control condition. For participants at the end of treatment we found high-certainty evidence showing a small positive effect of CR on self-efficacy (2 RCTs, 456 participants) and immediate recall (2 RCTs, 459 participants). For participants at medium-term follow-up we found moderate-certainty evidence showing a small positive effect of CR on auditory selective attention (2 RCTs, 386 participants), and a small negative effect on general functional ability (3 RCTs, 673 participants), and we found low-certainty evidence showing a small positive effect on sustained attention (2 RCTs, 413 participants), and a small negative effect on memory (2 RCTs, 51 participants) and anxiety (3 RCTs, 455 participants). We found moderate- and low-certainty evidence indicating that at the end of treatment CR had negligible effects on participant anxiety, quality of life, sustained attention, memory, delayed recall, and general functional ability, and at medium-term follow-up on participant self-efficacy, depression, quality of life, immediate recall, and verbal fluency. For care partners at the end of treatment we found low-certainty evidence showing a small positive effect on environmental aspects of quality of life (3 RCTs, 465 care partners), and small negative effects of CR on level of depression (2 RCTs, 32 care partners) and on psychological wellbeing (2 RCTs, 388 care partners). For care partners at medium-term follow-up we found high-certainty evidence showing a small positive effect of CR on social aspects of quality of life (3 RCTs, 436 care partners) and moderate-certainty evidence showing a small positive effect on psychological aspects of quality of life (3 RCTs, 437 care partners). We found moderate- and low-certainty evidence at the end of treatment that CR had negligible effects on care partners physical health, psychological and social aspects of quality of life, and stress, and at medium-term follow-up for the physical health aspect of care partners quality of life and psychological wellbeing. CR is helpful in enabling people with mild or moderate dementia to improve their ability to manage the everyday activities targeted in the intervention. Confidence in these findings could be strengthened if more high-quality studies contributed to the observed effects. The available evidence suggests that CR can form a valuable part of a clinical toolkit to assist people with dementia in overcoming some of the everyday barriers imposed by cognitive and functional difficulties. Future research, including process evaluation studies, could help identify avenues to maximise CR effects and achieve wider impacts on functional ability and wellbeing.","Dementia is a group of symptoms caused by changes in the brain that get worse over time. People with some types of dementia have difficulties with memory, planning, concentrating, and communicating. These and other thinking difficulties are collectively described by the umbrella term, 'cognitive impairment'. Cognitive impairment makes it harder to do daily activities and stay independent for as long as possible.
Cognitive rehabilitation is a personalised intervention. People have one-to-one sessions with a practitioner, usually in their own home. People identify everyday activities and tasks that they would like to manage better or do more independently. The practitioner suggests strategies and works with them to help achieve these improvements in the activities that are important to them. Family members are often involved as well.
We explored whether cognitive rehabilitation was better than usual treatment for: doing a chosen task or activity that matters to the person; managing daily activities; feeling confident about being able to manage things; feeling depressed or anxious; having a sense of wellbeing. We also explored whether cognitive rehabilitation was better for ensuring the wellbeing of the care partner - usually a husband, wife, or other close family member.
We searched for studies that rigorously tested the effects of cognitive rehabilitation for people with mild-to-moderate dementia. In these studies, some people had their usual treatment and others had their usual treatment plus cognitive rehabilitation. This made it possible to see whether cognitive rehabilitation was more helpful than usual treatment alone. We compared and summarised the results of the studies. We rated our confidence in the evidence the studies provided, based on the methods used and the numbers of people involved. We found six studies. They involved 1702 people with mild-to-moderate dementia, who had between 8 and 14 sessions with a cognitive rehabilitation practitioner. Alzheimers disease was the most common dementia diagnosis (59% of all participants, 82% of participants with the specific diagnosis reported).
The main findings are that, compared to people who just had their usual treatment, people who had cognitive rehabilitation got better at doing their chosen tasks or activities.
This improvement was seen by the people with dementia and by their care partners. The improvement was seen straight after cognitive rehabilitation and was still noticeable 3 to 12 months later.
Straight after cognitive rehabilitation, compared to people who just had their usual treatment, people with dementia may feel more confident about how they are managing.
There might not be any differences in the wellbeing of people with dementia and their care partners. We are not sure if there are any differences for people with dementia in managing other tasks or activities or in feeling depressed. Three to 12 months after cognitive rehabilitation, compared to usual treatment, care partners may have better psychological wellbeing.
There may not be any differences in how well people with dementia manage other tasks or activities, in how confident or depressed they feel, or in their wellbeing.
Our review included six studies, but the findings are based mostly on information from one large study. We do not know if the effects of cognitive rehabilitation last more than a year.

59cf062758b71700019882d4,interactive_4,Treatment options for people with recurrent and progressive glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly malignant brain tumour that almost always progresses or recurs after standard first-line treatment, and there is no consensus on the most effective therapy once the disease returns. This review evaluated available treatments for first and later recurrence in people previously treated with the standard Stupp protocol and included a brief economic commentary. Searches of major medical databases up to December 2019 identified 42 eligible studies (34 randomised trials and 8 non-randomised studies) involving 5236 participants. Most randomised trials had low risk of bias, while non-randomised studies had high risk of bias. Treatments included chemotherapy, re-operation, re-irradiation, and novel therapies used alone or in combination. For first recurrence, 11 treatments contributed to the overall survival network analysis and eight to the progression-free survival analysis, with lomustine (LOM/CCNU) used as the reference treatment. No included studies in the network meta-analysis evaluated surgery, re-irradiation, PCV, temozolomide (TMZ) rechallenge, or best supportive care, and quality-of-life data were sparse. Median overall survival ranged from 5.5 to 12.6 months and median progression-free survival from 1.5 to 4.2 months. No high-certainty evidence showed any treatment improved survival compared with lomustine. Bevacizumab plus lomustine probably resulted in little or no difference in survival compared with lomustine alone, though it may improve progression-free survival. Bevacizumab alone may offer little or no survival benefit, and evidence remains uncertain. Regorafenib may improve overall survival compared with lomustine but evidence certainty was low. Temozolomide plus Depatux-M (ABT414) may improve survival compared with lomustine or bevacizumab, possibly driven by the temozolomide component, but additional evidence is needed. Fotemustine may have similar effects to lomustine. Evidence for bevacizumab plus irinotecan was very uncertain, and it likely offers little benefit over bevacizumab alone. Ranking analyses placed fotemustine first, followed by bevacizumab plus lomustine, lomustine alone, bevacizumab plus irinotecan, and bevacizumab alone, though ranking does not reflect evidence certainty. Three studies examining re-operation suggested it may extend survival in carefully selected patients. One early-phase study suggested a potential role for a cannabinoid plus temozolomide. Evidence for treatment of second or later recurrence was limited; some heterogeneous studies suggested radiotherapy with or without bevacizumab may improve survival, while tumour-treating fields showed little difference compared with physician's choice. No reliable evidence was found for best supportive care. Severe adverse events were significantly more common with bevacizumab plus lomustine than with lomustine alone and were similarly high with cediranib plus lomustine. Lomustine alone had the lowest rate of severe adverse events, followed by regorafenib. Combinations that added novel agents to bevacizumab generally increased toxicity. Overall, combination treatments for first recurrence did not improve survival compared with lomustine monotherapy and were often associated with more severe adverse events. Re-operation and re-irradiation may benefit selected individuals. Evidence for later recurrences remains sparse, and more high-quality research is needed.","Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a very aggressive brain tumour that often continues to grow even after surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, and almost always comes back. Many different treatments have been tested for tumour progression or recurrence, but there is no agreement on which option is best. This review evaluated treatments for people whose GBM progressed or recurred after receiving standard initial care. A total of 42 studies involving 5236 people were included. Treatments examined included chemotherapy, re-operation, re-irradiation, and newer therapies used alone or in combination. For first recurrence, none of the treatments showed clear evidence of being better than lomustine (CCNU). Adding bevacizumab to lomustine did not improve overall survival, and most other agents either had uncertain benefits or did not improve outcomes. Several commonly used treatments such as PCV and temozolomide re-challenge were not represented in the available evidence. Limited evidence suggested that a second surgery, with or without additional therapies, may offer some survival benefit in selected individuals. For second or later recurrence, evidence was too limited for statistical analysis, but radiotherapy with or without bevacizumab might offer some benefit, though this is uncertain. Serious side effects occurred with many treatments, and combining bevacizumab with lomustine resulted in more severe adverse events than lomustine alone. Overall, lomustine appears to be the most effective chemotherapy option for first recurrence, and other combination therapies generally carried higher risks without clear benefits. A second surgery or radiotherapy may be helpful for some individuals. For later recurrences, evidence is sparse and uncertain. More research is needed, especially for commonly used treatments not evaluated in the included studies.",1022,Glioblastoma; Stupp protocol; lomustine; progression-free survival; overall survival; bevacizumab; temozolomide; Fotemustine; re-irradiation; severe adverse events,In what ways do the reviewed treatments reflect the challenges in managing GBM recurrences?,What was the main purpose of the study?,Select all of the following that are colors,Which treatment appeared most effective for first recurrence of GBM?,Describe how combination therapies for GBM first recurrence impacted outcomes.,Lack of treatments with clear survival benefits; Abundance of high-certainty evidence; Uniformity in patient response to treatments,Lack of treatments with clear survival benefits,To establish a new treatment protocol for GBM.; To evaluate treatments for GBM recurrence.; To prove the effectiveness of surgery for GBM.,To evaluate treatments for GBM recurrence.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Bevacizumab plus lomustine.; Lomustine alone.; Regorafenib.,Lomustine alone.,Combination therapies improved overall survival.; Combination therapies often increased severe adverse events.; Combination therapies provided clear benefits over lomustine.,Combination therapies often increased severe adverse events.

A thorough understanding of the current body of evidence regarding benefits and risks of this intervention is required. To assess the effectiveness and safety of convalescent plasma transfusion in the treatment of people with COVID-19; and to maintain the currency of the evidence using a living systematic review approach. To identify completed and ongoing studies, we searched the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease Research Database, MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, and the Epistemonikos COVID-19 L*OVE Platform. We searched monthly until 03 March 2022. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating convalescent plasma for COVID-19, irrespective of disease severity, age, gender or ethnicity. We excluded studies that included populations with other coronavirus diseases (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)), as well as studies evaluating standard immunoglobulin. We followed standard Cochrane methodology. To assess bias in included studies we used RoB 2. We used the GRADE approach to rate the certainty of evidence for the following outcomes: all-cause mortality at up to day 28, worsening and improvement of clinical status (for individuals with moderate to severe disease), hospital admission or death, COVID-19 symptoms resolution (for individuals with mild disease), quality of life, grade 3 or 4 adverse events, and serious adverse events. In this fourth review update version, we included 33RCTs with 24,861 participants, of whom 11,432 received convalescent plasma. Of these, nine studies are single-centre studies and 24 are multi-centre studies. Fourteen studies took place in America, eight in Europe, three in South-East Asia, two in Africa, two in western Pacific and three in eastern Mediterranean regions and one in multiple regions. We identified a further 49 ongoingstudies evaluating convalescent plasma, and 33 studies reporting as being completed. Individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and moderate to severe disease 29 RCTs investigated the use of convalescent plasma for 22,728 participants with moderate to severe disease. 23 RCTs with 22,020 participants compared convalescent plasma to placebo or standard care alone, five compared to standard plasma and one compared to human immunoglobulin. We evaluate subgroups on detection of antibodies detection, symptom onset, country income groups and several co-morbidities in the full text. Convalescent plasma versus placebo or standard care alone Convalescent plasma does not reduce all-cause mortality at up to day 28 (risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92 to 1.03; 220 per 1000; 21 RCTs, 19,021 participants; high-certainty evidence). It has little to no impact on need for invasive mechanical ventilation, or death (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.11; 296 per 1000; 6 RCTs, 14,477 participants; high-certainty evidence) and has no impact on whether participants are discharged from hospital (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.02; 665 per 1000; 6 RCTs, 12,721 participants; high-certainty evidence).

Convalescent plasma may have little to no impact on the risk of grades 3 and 4 adverse events (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.42; 212 per 1000; 6 RCTs, 2392 participants; low-certainty evidence). It has probably little to no effect on the risk of serious adverse events (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.44; 135 per 1000; 6 RCTs, 3901 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Convalescent plasma versus standard plasma We are uncertain whether convalescent plasma reduces or increases all-cause mortality at up to day 28 (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.19; 129 per 1000; 4 RCTs, 484 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether convalescent plasma reduces or increases the need for invasive mechanical ventilation, or death (RR 5.59, 95% CI 0.29 to 108.38; 311 per 1000; 1 study, 34 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and whether it reduces or increases the risk of serious adverse events (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.15; 236 per 1000; 3 RCTs, 327 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We did not identify any study reporting other key outcomes. Convalescent plasma versus human immunoglobulin Convalescent plasma may have little to no effect on all-cause mortality at up to day 28 (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.50; 464 per 1000; 1 study, 190 participants; low-certainty evidence). We did not identify any study reporting other key outcomes. Individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and mild disease We identified two RCTs reporting on 536 participants, comparing convalescent plasma to placebo or standard care alone, and two RCTs reporting on 1597 participants with mild disease, comparing convalescent plasma to standard plasma. Convalescent plasma versus placebo or standard care alone We are uncertain whether convalescent plasma reduces all-cause mortality at up to day 28 (odds ratio (OR) 0.36, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.46; 8 per 1000; 2 RCTs, 536 participants; very low-certainty evidence). It may have little to no effect on admission to hospital or death within 28 days (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.84; 117 per 1000; 1 RCT, 376 participants; low-certainty evidence), on time to COVID-19 symptom resolution (hazard ratio (HR) 1.05, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.30; 483 per 1000; 1 RCT, 376 participants; low-certainty evidence), on the risk of grades 3 and 4 adverse events (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.75 to 2.19; 144 per 1000; 1 RCT, 376 participants; low-certainty evidence) and the risk of serious adverse events (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.94; 133 per 1000; 1 RCT, 376 participants; low-certainty evidence). We did not identify any study reporting other key outcomes. Convalescent plasma versus standard plasma We are uncertain whether convalescent plasma reduces all-cause mortality at up to day 28 (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.75; 2 per 1000; 2 RCTs, 1597 participants; very low-certainty evidence). It probably reduces admission to hospital or death within 28 days (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.75; 36 per 1000; 2 RCTs, 1595 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Convalescent plasma may have little to no effect on initial symptom resolution at up to day 28 (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.27; 1 RCT, 416 participants; low-certainty evidence). We did not identify any study reporting other key outcomes. This is a living systematic review. We search monthly for new evidence and update the review when we identify relevant new evidence. For the comparison of convalescent plasma versus placebo or standard care alone, our certainty in the evidence that convalescent plasma for individuals with moderate to severe disease does not reduce mortality and has little to no impact on clinical improvement or worsening is high. It probably has little to no effect on SAEs. For individuals with mild disease, we have very-low to low certainty evidence for most primary outcomes and moderate certainty for hospital admission or death. There are 49 ongoing studies, and 33 studies reported as complete in a trials registry. Publication of ongoing studies might resolve some of the uncertainties around convalescent plasma therapy for people with asymptomatic or mild disease.","Convalescent plasma is plasma containing antibodies produced by the body as a defence against infection, taken from people who have recovered from COVID-19 and used to make treatment that can be given by a drip or injection; while generally well-tolerated, it can cause unwanted effects. We wanted to find out whether convalescent plasma is an effective treatment for people with confirmed COVID-19, looking at deaths from any cause after treatment, worsening of patients' condition measured by the number of people needing ventilator support or who died, improvement measured by hospital discharge, quality of life, and unwanted effects. We searched for studies worldwide that investigated convalescent plasma in people of any age, gender, ethnicity, and with mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19, pooled results when possible, and rated our confidence based on study methods and sizes. We found 33 studies with 24,861 participants, including 29 studies in moderate to severe COVID-19 and four in mild disease, mostly conducted in hospitals worldwide; the findings compare convalescent plasma with placebo or standard care. For people with moderate to severe COVID-19, convalescent plasma makes no difference to deaths within 28 days (about 225 in 1000 died vs 220 in 1000 given plasma), makes little to no difference in needing invasive mechanical ventilation or dying (287 in 1000 vs 296 in 1000), and makes no difference to being discharged from hospital (665 in 1000 in both groups). It probably makes no difference to serious unwanted effects (118 in 1000 vs 133 in 1000) and may result in no difference in quality of life. For people with mild COVID-19, convalescent plasma may result in no difference in deaths within 28 days (22 in 1000 on placebo/standard care vs 9 in 1000 on plasma), may result in no difference in admission to hospital or death within 28 days (112 in 1000 vs 117 in 1000), may result in no difference in the time until symptoms resolved, and may result in no difference in serious unwanted effects. The limitations of the evidence are that we are very confident in the evidence for deaths, worsening, and improvement in moderate to severe COVID-19 due to consistent high-quality studies, but confidence in other evidence for moderate, severe, and mild COVID-19 is limited because we could not identify enough consistent results; there is still little evidence on quality of life and for people with mild disease, and none for those without COVID-19 symptoms.",1108,Convalescent plasma; viral respiratory diseases; coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS); Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS); RoB 2; mechanical ventilation; quality of life; human immunoglobulin; SARS-CoV-2 infection,What inference can be drawn about the impact of convalescent plasma on deaths within 28 days for patients with moderate to severe COVID-19?,What is the estimated effectiveness of convalescent plasma in improving the quality of life for patients with moderate to severe COVID-19?,Select all of the following that are colors,What conclusion can be drawn about the unwanted effects of convalescent plasma therapy for moderate to severe COVID-19?,What hypothesis could be formulated for further studies to resolve uncertainties about convalescent plasma in asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 cases?,"Convalescent plasma significantly reduces mortality.; Convalescent plasma has no impact on mortality compared to placebo or standard care.; The evidence shows mixed results, making it inconclusive.",Convalescent plasma has no impact on mortality compared to placebo or standard care.,The plasma significantly improves quality of life.; There is little to no difference in quality of life compared to standard care.; The evidence on quality of life was robust and conclusive.,There is little to no difference in quality of life compared to standard care.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Convalescent plasma likely increases serious unwanted effects.; The therapy probably makes no difference in the occurrence of serious unwanted effects.; The therapy has a clear difference in reducing unwanted effects.,The therapy probably makes no difference in the occurrence of serious unwanted effects.,Convalescent plasma significantly enhances symptom resolution.; Further large-scale studies will clarify its impact on mild cases.; More randomised trials are unnecessary based on current evidence.,Further large-scale studies will clarify its impact on mild cases.

To our knowledge, no systematic review has been published on their efficacy and safety for acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections (RTIs) in children without chronic broncho-pulmonary disease. The objective was to assess the efficacy and safety and to establish a benefit-risk ratio of acetylcysteine and carbocysteine as symptomatic treatments for acute upper and lower RTIs in paediatric patients without chronic broncho-pulmonary disease. We searched CENTRAL (2013, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 to February week 3, 2013), EMBASE (1980 to March 2013), Micromedex (2010), Pascal (1987 to 2004) and Science Citation Index (1974 to March 2013). To study efficacy, we used randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the use of acetylcysteine or carbocysteine versus placebo, either alone or as an add-on therapy. To study safety, we used trials comparing acetylcysteine or carbocysteine versus active treatment or no treatment and case reports. In this review update two review authors (YD, MC), with help from a colleague, extracted data and assessed trial quality. We performed a subgroup analysis of children younger than two years of age. We included six trials involving 497 participants to study efficacy. They showed some benefit (e.g. reduction of cough at day seven) from mucolytic agents, although differences were of little clinical relevance. No conclusion was drawn about the subgroup of infants younger than two years because data were unavailable. Thirty-four studies, including the previous six trials involving 2064 children, were eligible to study safety. Overall safety was good but very few data were available to evaluate safety in infants younger than two years. However, 59 cases of paradoxically increased bronchorrhoea observed in infants were reported to the French pharmacovigilance system. The results have to be interpreted with caution because they are based on a limited number of participants included in studies whose methodological quality is questionable. Acetylcysteine and carbocysteine seem to have a limited efficacy and appear to be safe in children older than two years. These results should take into consideration the fact that acetylcysteine and carbocysteine are prescribed for self limiting diseases (for example, acute cough, bronchitis). Given strong concerns about safety, these drugs should only be used for acute upper and lower RTIs in the context of a RCT with regards to children younger than two years.","Acetylcysteine and carbocysteine are the most commonly prescribed drugs intended to modify the structure of bronchial secretions. This systematic review evaluated their efficacy and safety for treating acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections in children without chronic broncho-pulmonary disease, with particular attention to children younger than two years of age. Forty-nine trials met the inclusion criteria. Six trials involving 497 participants were used to assess efficacy, comparing acetylcysteine or carbocysteine with placebo. Thirty-four trials, including those six, were eligible to assess safety and involved 2064 paediatric patients. The results suggest that acetylcysteine and carbocysteine have real but limited efficacy, such as reducing cough by day seven, and appear generally safe aside from rare mild gastrointestinal side effects in children older than two years. However, these conclusions are limited by the small number of participants and questionable methodological quality. Their use should also be considered in light of the fact that these drugs are prescribed for self-limiting illnesses such as acute cough and bronchitis.

59cf062758b71700019882d4,finetuned_6,Case management approaches to home support for people with dementia,"Over 35 million people are estimated to be living with dementia in the world and the societal costs are very high. Case management is a widely used and strongly promoted complex intervention for organising and co-ordinating care at the level of the individual, with the aim of providing long-term care for people with dementia in the community as an alternative to early admission to a care home or hospital. To evaluate the effectiveness of case management approaches to home support for people with dementia, from the perspective of the different people involved (patients, carers, and staff) compared with other forms of treatment, including treatment as usual, standard community treatment and other non-case management interventions. We searched the following databases up to 31 December 2013: ALOIS, the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group, The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, Web of Science (including Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED) and Social Science Citation Index), Campbell Collaboration/SORO database and the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group. We updated this search in March 2014 but results have not yet been incorporated. We include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of case management interventions for people with dementia living in the community and their carers. We screened interventions to ensure that they focused on planning and co-ordination of care. We used standard methodological procedures as required by The Cochrane Collaboration. Two review authors independently extracted data and made 'Risk of bias' assessments using Cochrane criteria. For continuous outcomes, we used the mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) between groups along with its confidence interval (95% CI). We applied a fixed- or random-effects model as appropriate. For binary or dichotomous data, we generated the corresponding odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI. We assessed heterogeneity by the  I² statistic. We include 13 RCTs involving 9615 participants with dementia in the review. Case management interventions in studies varied. We found low to moderate overall risk of bias; 69% of studies were at high risk for performance bias. The case management group were significantly less likely to be institutionalised (admissions to residential or nursing homes) at six months (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.98, n = 5741, 6 RCTs,  I² = 0%, P = 0.02) and at 18 months (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.61, n = 363, 4 RCTs,  I² = 0%, P = 0.003). However, the effects at 10 - 12 months (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.08, n = 5990, 9 RCTs, IÃÆÃÆÃâÃÂ¯ÃÆÃâÃâÃÂ¿ÃÆÃâÃâÃÂ½ = 48%, P = 0.39) and 24 months (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.52 to 2.03, n = 201, 2 RCTs,  I² = 0%, P = 0.94) were uncertain. There was evidence from one trial of a reduction in the number of days per month in a residential home or hospital unit in the case management group at six months (MD -5.80, 95% CI -7.93 to -3.67, n = 88, 1 RCT, P < 0.0001) and at 12 months (MD -7.70, 95% CI -9.38 to -6.02, n = 88, 1 RCT, P < 0.0001). One trial reported the length of time until participants were institutionalised at 12 months and the effects were uncertain (hazard ratio (HR): 0.66, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.14, P = 0.14). There was no difference in the number of people admitted to hospital at six (4 RCTs, 439 participants), 12 (5 RCTs, 585 participants) and 18 months (5 RCTs, 613 participants). For mortality at 4 - 6, 12, 18 - 24 and 36 months, and for participants' or carers' quality of life at 4, 6, 12 and 18 months, there were no significant effects. There was some evidence of benefits in carer burden at six months (SMD -0.07, 95% CI -0.12 to -0.01, n = 4601, 4 RCTs,  I² = 26%, P = 0.03) but the effects at 12 or 18 months were uncertain. Additionally, some evidence indicated case management was more effective at reducing behaviour disturbance at 18 months (SMD -0.35, 95% CI -0.63 to -0.07, n = 206, 2 RCTs  I² = 0%, P = 0.01) but effects were uncertain at four (2 RCTs), six (4 RCTs) or 12 months (5 RCTs). The case management group showed a small significant improvement in carer depression at 18 months (SMD -0.08, 95% CI -0.16 to -0.01, n = 2888, 3 RCTs, I² = 0%, P = 0.03). Conversely, the case management group showed greater improvement in carer well-being in a single study at six months (MD -2.20 CI -4.14 to -0.26, n = 65, 1 RCT, P = 0.03) but the effects were uncertain at 12 or 18 months. There was some evidence that case management reduced the total cost of services at 12 months (SMD -0.07, 95% CI -0.12 to -0.02, n = 5276, 2 RCTs, P = 0.01) and incurred lower dollar expenditure for the total three years (MD -705.00, 95% CI -1170.31 to -239.69, n = 5170, 1 RCT, P = 0.003). Data on a number of outcomes consistently indicated that the intervention group received significantly more community services. There is some evidence that case management is beneficial at improving some outcomes at certain time points, both in the person with dementia and in their carer. However, there was considerable heterogeneity between the interventions, outcomes measured and time points across the 13 included RCTs. There was some evidence from good-quality studies to suggest that admissions to care homes and overall healthcare costs are reduced in the medium term; however, the results at longer points of follow-up were uncertain. There was not enough evidence to clearly assess whether case management could delay institutionalisation in care homes. There were uncertain results in patient depression, functional abilities and cognition. Further work should be undertaken to investigate what components of case management are associated with improvement in outcomes. Increased consistency in measures of outcome would support future meta-analysis.","Many people are affected by dementia and the numbers are expected to rise as populations age. Most types of dementia are characterised by loss of memory and impairment in other cognitive functions, accompanied by functional impairment and difficulties in performing activities of daily living. The increasing number of people with dementia means more demand for both informal and formal sources of care. The extent of support provided depends on factors such as living situation, patient's and carer's characteristics, service provision, and availability of social networks. There are also wider financial costs of care, for example carers missing work for appointments or crises, becoming part-time workers, or leaving work altogether. Developing interventions such as case management, which enhances the co-ordination between different agencies involved in community care, might offer the support necessary to cover some of the needs of people with dementia and their carers. How case management is organised and implemented varies widely, and access to this type of care is influenced by long-term care funding policies and cultural variations in different countries. Case management has been tested in people with dementia and in carers in a number of countries and healthcare systems, but it is not clear whether current evidence supports its effectiveness. We found 13 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including 9615 participants with dementia worldwide. Eleven RCTs also included carers. Studies were conducted in different countries, varied in size and healthcare systems and compared various types of case management interventions with usual care or augmented usual care. Some studies examined the benefit of case management in reducing admissions to residential or nursing homes (institutionalisation). We found benefits at six months and 18 months but not at 12 and 24 months. However, when only studies which were clearly focused upon delaying institutionalisation or prolonging the period of community care were included we found a reduction in institutionalisation at 12 months. Some studies examined the benefits of case management in terms of reduced hospital length of stay, and there was evidence to suggest that it might increase at six months. Some studies indicated that case management was more effective at reducing behaviour disturbance at 18 months, reducing carer burden and depression and improving carer well-being at six months and social support at 12 months. Case management increases the use of community services but there was some indication that overall healthcare costs may be reduced in the first year. Some studies reported that case management was no more effective than usual care in improving patient depression, functional abilities or cognition. There was not enough evidence to clearly assess whether case management could increase the length of time until people with dementia were admitted to care homes. There were some problems regarding the methods of the studies. Similarly, the different ways in which the case management interventions were provided and the differences in outcome measurements made it difficult to draw clear conclusions.",1124,dementia; case management; institutionalisation; residential or nursing homes; community services; care homes; healthcare costs; behaviour disturbance; cognitive improvement; functional abilities,What are the implications of case management interventions on healthcare costs according to the studies?,How does the variability in case management implementation affect the study's conclusions?,Select all of the following that are colors,In what manner could the study's methodology be adjusted to improve its focus on long-term outcomes?,What differences were observed in the effectiveness of case management at various follow-up points?,"They consistently reduce overall healthcare costs.; They show mixed results, with some indication of cost reduction at 12 months.; They increase healthcare costs due to the integration of multiple services.","They show mixed results, with some indication of cost reduction at 12 months.",It creates challenges in measuring consistent outcomes.; It simplifies the comparison between different healthcare systems.; It enhances the generalizability of the study's results.,It creates challenges in measuring consistent outcomes.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,By incorporating a larger number of RCTs focused on longer follow-up periods.; By restricting the study to short-term outcomes only.; By increasing the sample size without altering the follow-up duration.,By incorporating a larger number of RCTs focused on longer follow-up periods.,Significant differences in institutionalization reduction were observed only at 6 and 18 months.; All time points showed equal effectiveness in reducing institutionalization.; Every follow-up point showed a consistent level of reduced healthcare costs.,Significant differences in institutionalization reduction were observed only at 6 and 18 months.
5db0a97f127d4000117cdfa0,static_1,Vitamin and mineral supplementation for preventing dementia or delaying cognitive decline in people with mild cognitive impairment,"Vitamins and minerals have many functions in the nervous system which are important for brain health. It has been suggested that various different vitamin and mineral supplements might be useful in maintaining cognitive function and delaying the onset of dementia. In this review, we sought to examine the evidence for this in people who already had mild cognitive impairment (MCI). To evaluate the effects of vitamin and mineral supplementation on cognitive function and the incidence of dementia in people with mild cognitive impairment. We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Groups (CDCIG) specialised register, as well as MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CENTRAL, CINAHL, LILACs, Web of Science Core Collection, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO Portal/ICTRP, from inception to 25 January 2018. We included randomised or quasi-randomised, placebo-controlled trials which evaluated orally administered vitamin or mineral supplements in participants with a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment and which assessed the incidence of dementia or cognitive outcomes, or both. We were interested in studies applicable to the general population of older people and therefore excluded studies in which participants had severe vitamin or mineral deficiencies. We sought data on our primary outcomes of dementia incidence and overall cognitive function and on secondary outcomes of episodic memory, executive function, speed of processing, quality of life, functional performance, clinical global impression, adverse events, and mortality. We conducted data collection and analysis according to standard Cochrane systematic review methods. We assessed the risk of bias of included studies using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' assessment tool. We grouped vitamins and minerals according to their putative mechanism of action and, where we considered it to be clinically appropriate, we pooled data using random-effects methods. We used GRADE methods to assess the overall quality of evidence for each comparison and outcome. We included five trials with 879 participants which investigated B vitamin supplements. In four trials, the intervention was a combination of vitamins B6, B12, and folic acid; in one, it was folic acid only. Doses varied. We considered there to be some risks of performance and attrition bias and of selective outcome reporting among these trials. Our primary efficacy outcomes were the incidence of dementia and scores on measures of overall cognitive function. None of the trials reported the incidence of dementia and the evidence on overall cognitive function was of very low-quality. There was probably little or no effect of B vitamins taken for six to 24 months on episodic memory, executive function, speed of processing, or quality of life. The evidence on our other secondary clinical outcomes, including harms, was very sparse or very low-quality. There was evidence from one study that there may be a slower rate of brain atrophy over two years in participants taking B vitamins. The same study reported subgroup analyses based on the level of serum homocysteine (tHcy) at baseline and found evidence that B vitamins may improve episodic memory in those with tHcy above the median at baseline. We included one trial (n = 516) of vitamin E supplementation. Vitamin E was given as 1000 IU of alpha-tocopherol twice daily. We considered this trial to be at risk of attrition and selective reporting bias. There was probably no effect of vitamin E on the probability of progression from MCI to Alzheimer's dementia over three years (HR 1.02; 95% CI 0.74 to 1.41; n = 516; 1 study, moderate-quality evidence). There was also no evidence of an effect at intermediate time points. The available data did not allow us to conduct analyses, but the authors reported no significant effect of three years of supplementation with vitamin E on overall cognitive function, episodic memory, speed of processing, clinical global impression, functional performance, adverse events, or mortality (five deaths in each group). We considered this to be low-quality evidence. We included one trial (n = 256) of combined vitamin E and vitamin C supplementation and one trial (n = 26) of supplementation with chromium picolinate. In both cases, there was a single eligible cognitive outcome, but we considered the evidence to be very low-quality and so could not be sure of any effects. The evidence on vitamin and mineral supplements as treatments for MCI is very limited. Three years of treatment with high-dose vitamin E probably does not reduce the risk of progression to dementia, but we have no data on this outcome for other supplements. Only B vitamins have been assessed in more than one RCT. There is no evidence for beneficial effects on cognition of supplementation with B vitamins for six to 24 months. Evidence from a single study of a reduced rate of brain atrophy in participants taking vitamin B and a beneficial effect of vitamin B on episodic memory in those with higher tHcy at baseline warrants attempted replication.","This review investigated whether people with mild cognitive impairment can reduce their risk of developing dementia, or can prevent their memory or other thinking skills from deteriorating further, by taking vitamin or mineral supplements. Slight changes in memory and thinking skills are common as people get older. When these changes are worse than can be expected in normal ageing, but are not bad enough to make a person's usual activities difficult to manage, then the person is said to have mild cognitive impairment (MCI). People with MCI are at increased risk of developing dementia in the future.
Vitamins and minerals are naturally occurring substances which are needed in the diet to maintain health. They have lots of different functions in the body and many are essential to keep the brain working properly. It has been suggested that supplementing a person's normal diet with extra doses of these vitamins or minerals might help to maintain thinking skills or prevent dementia.
We found eight randomised controlled trials (RCTs), which investigated four different types of vitamin or mineral pills by comparing them to a placebo (a dummy pill). The vitamins tested were B vitamins (vitamin B6, vitamin B12 and folic acid), vitamin E, and vitamin E and C given together. The only mineral tested was chromium. The amount and quality of research evidence about vitamin and mineral supplements for treating MCI in people without nutritional deficiency is limited. At the moment, it is not possible to identify any supplements which can reduce the risk of people with MCI developing dementia or which can effectively treat their symptoms.",1129,mild cognitive impairment; dementia; B vitamins; brain atrophy; episodic memory; executive function; speed of processing; functional performance; alpha-tocopherol; homocysteine level,What conclusions can be drawn from the study regarding the efficacy of B vitamins on overall cognitive function in people with mild cognitive impairment?,How does the evidence from the review support or refute the use of vitamin E in preventing progression to Alzheimer's dementia over three years?,Select the items that are animals,What factors would need to be addressed in future research to improve the reliability of findings related to vitamin supplementation and cognitive outcomes?,What was the primary focus of the study?,B vitamins significantly improve overall cognitive function.; B vitamins have little or no effect on overall cognitive function.; B vitamins show potential for improving overall cognitive function.,B vitamins have little or no effect on overall cognitive function.,Vitamin E has no significant effect on the progression to Alzheimer's dementia.; Vitamin E significantly reduces the risk of AlzheimerÃ¢ÂÂs dementia.; Vitamin E may have a potential impact on delaying AlzheimerÃ¢ÂÂs dementia.,Vitamin E has no significant effect on the progression to Alzheimer's dementia.,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,Increased sample sizes and long-term studies.; Exclusive focus on vitamin D supplementation.; Only testing on participants with severe deficiencies.,Increased sample sizes and long-term studies.,Reducing the risk of developing dementia with supplements; Developing new vitamin supplements; Improving physical fitness in the elderly,Reducing the risk of developing dementia with supplements
5db0a97f127d4000117cdfa0,static_2,Integrated compared with non-integrated orbital implants for treating anophthalmic sockets,"Anophthalmia is the absence of one or both eyes, and it can be congenital (i.e. a birth defect) or acquired later in life. There are two main types of orbital implant: integrated, whereby the implant receives a blood supply from the body that allows for the integration of the prosthesis within the tissue; and non-integrated, where the implant remains separate. Despite the remarkable progress in anophthalmic socket reconstruction and in the development of various types of implants, there are still uncertainties about the real roles of integrated (hydroxyapatite (HA), porous polyethylene (PP), composites) and non-integrated (polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA)/acrylic and silicone) orbital implants in anophthalmic socket treatment.
To assess the effects of integrated versus non-integrated orbital implants for treating anophthalmic sockets.
We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2016, Issue 7), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to August 2016), Embase (January 1980 to August 2016), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (1982 to August 2016), the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov), and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 8 August 2016.
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of integrated and non-integrated orbital implants for treating anophthalmic sockets.
Two authors independently selected relevant trials, assessed methodological quality and extracted data.
We included three studies with a total of 284 participants (250 included in analysis). The studies were conducted in India, Iran and the Netherlands. The three studies were clinically heterogenous, comparing different materials and using different surgical techniques. None of the included studies used a peg (i.e. a fixing pin used to connect the implant to the prosthesis). In general the trials were poorly reported, and we judged them to be at unclear risk of bias. One trial compared HA using traditional enucleation versus alloplastic implantation using evisceration (N = 100). This trial was probably not masked. The second trial compared PP with scleral cap enucleation versus PMMA with either myoconjunctival or traditional enucleation (N = 150). Although participants were not masked, outcome assessors were. The last trial compared HA and acrylic using the enucleation technique (N = 34) but did not report comparative effectiveness data. In the trial comparing HA versus alloplastic implantation, there was no evidence of any difference between the two groups with respect to the proportion of successful procedures at one year (risk ratio (RR) 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95 to 1.09, N = 100, low-certainty evidence). People receiving HA had slightly worse horizontal implant mobility compared to the alloplastic group (mean difference (MD) -3.35 mm, 95% CI - 4.08 to - 2.62, very low-certainty evidence) and slightly worse vertical implant motility (MD -2.76 mm, 95% CI -3.45 to -2.07, very low-certainty evidence). As different techniques were used - enucleation versus evisceration - it is not clear whether these differences in implant motility can be attributed solely to the type of material. Investigators did not report adverse events. In the trial comparing PP versus PMMA, there was no evidence of any difference between the two groups with respect to the proportion of successful procedures at one year (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.01, N = 150, low-certainty evidence). There was very low-certainty evidence of a difference in horizontal implant motility depending on whether PP was compared to PMMA with traditional enucleation (MD 1.96 mm, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.91) or PMMA with myoconjunctival enucleation (-0.57 mm, 95% CI -1.63 to 0.49). Similarly, for vertical implant motility, there was very low-certainty evidence of a difference in the comparison of PP to PMMA traditional (MD 3.12 mm 95% CI 2.36 to 3.88) but no evidence of a difference when comparing PP to PMMA myoconjunctival (MD -0.20 mm 95% CI  -1.28 to 0.88). Four people in the PP group (total N = 50) experienced adverse events (i.e. exposures) compared to 6/100 in the PMMA groups (RR 17.82, 95% CI 0.98 to 324.67, N = 150, very low-certainty evidence). None of the studies reported socket sphere size, cosmetic effect or quality of life measures.
Current very low-certainty evidence from three small published randomised controlled trials did not provide sufficient evidence to assess the effect of integrated and non-integrated material orbital implants for treating anophthalmic sockets. This review underlines the need to conduct further well-designed trials in this field.","The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out if integrated orbital implants are better than non-integrated orbital implants for treating anophthalmic sockets. Cochrane researchers collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found three studies.
There is uncertainty as to the benefits and harms of integrated compared with non-integrated orbital implants. What was studied in the review? 'Anophthalmia' is the absence of the eye in the orbit. This can occur in childhood (because of problems with development) or it can happen during the course of life (due to an accident or other eye disease).
Doctors can put an implant in the orbit to fill the void left by the removal of the eye and this together with an external prosthesis can improve the patient's appearance. This orbital implant can be made of two types of materials - integrated or non-integrated material. If the material is integrated, then new blood vessels can grow into the implant material. If the material is non-integrated, then the orbital implant remains separate from the rest of the orbit's tissue.
The review authors looked to see if the type of implant material affected the success of the surgery or, in other words, if integrated implants can provide better results than non-integrated implants. They were also interested in how much the external prosthesis could move better after surgery - using integrated or non-integrated orbital implants. Also, the authors wanted to know if the type of orbital implant material can affect people's quality of life. Were there any adverse (harmful) effects of using integrated or non-integrated orbital implants?
The type of material used for the orbital implant may not affect the success of the surgery (low-certainty evidence). The review authors judged the evidence on prosthesis movement and adverse effects as providing very little certainty about the true effects. There was no information on quality of life.

5db0a97f127d4000117cdfa0,static_2,Long-term treatment for people with persistent depression,"Persistent depressive disorder (PDD) is defined as a depressive disorder with a minimum illness duration of two years, including four diagnostic subgroups (dysthymia, chronic major depression, recurrent major depression with incomplete remission between episodes, and double depression), and persistent forms of depression represent a substantial proportion of depressive disorders, with a lifetime prevalence ranging from 3% to 6% in the Western world; growing evidence indicates that PDD responds well to several acute interventions, such as combined psychological and pharmacological treatments, yet given the high rates of relapse and recurrences of depression following response to acute treatment, long-term continuation and maintenance therapy are of great importance, and to date there has been no evidence synthesis available on continuation and maintenance treatments of PDDs. The aim of this review was to assess the effects of pharmacological and psychological (either alone or combined) continuation and maintenance treatments for persistent depressive disorder, in comparison with each other, placebo (drug/attention placebo/non-specific treatment control), and treatment as usual (TAU), with continuation treatments defined as treatments given to currently remitted people (remission is defined as depressive symptoms dropping below case level) or to people who previously responded to an antidepressant treatment, and maintenance therapy given during recovery (defined as remission lasting longer than six months). We searched Ovid MEDLINE (1950- ), Embase (1974- ), PsycINFO (1967- ) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to 28 September 2018, with an earlier search of these databases also conducted via the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trial Register (CCMD-CTR) to 11 December 2015; in addition we searched grey literature resources, ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP to 28 September 2018, screened reference lists of included studies, and contacted the first author of included studies. We included randomized (RCTs) and non-randomized controlled trials (NRCTs) in adults with formally diagnosed PDD, receiving pharmacological, psychological, or combined continuation and maintenance interventions. Two review authors independently selected studies and extracted and analyzed data; the primary efficacy outcome was relapse/recurrence rate of depression, and the primary acceptance outcome was dropout due to any reason other than relapse/recurrence; we performed random-effects meta-analyses using risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We included 10 studies (seven RCTs, three NRCTs) involving 840 participants, with five studies investigating continuation treatments and five investigating maintenance treatments; overall, the included studies were at low-to-moderate risk of bias, with the most common source of risk of bias in NRCTs being selection of reported results, and in RCTs non-blinding of outcome assessment and other bias (especially conflict of interest due to pharmaceutical sponsoring). The most common comparison was antidepressant medication versus tablet placebo (five studies), and participants taking antidepressant medication were probably less likely to relapse or to experience a recurrent episode compared to participants in the placebo group at the end of the intervention (13.9% versus 33.8%, RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.79; participants = 383; studies = 4;  I²  = 54%, moderate quality evidence); overall dropout rates may be similar between participants in the medication and placebo group (23.0% versus 25.5%, RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.39 to 2.11; RCTs = 4; participants = 386;  I²  = 64%, low quality evidence), although sensitivity analyses showed that the primary outcome (rate of relapse/recurrence) showed no evidence of a difference between groups when only including studies with low risk of bias. None of the studies compared pharmacological or psychological treatments versus TAU. One study compared psychological therapies versus attention placebo/non-specific control, and one study compared psychotherapy with medication; the results of the studies including psychotherapy might indicate that continued or maintained psychotherapy could be a useful intervention compared to no treatment or antidepressant medication, but the body of evidence for these comparisons was too small and uncertain to draw high quality conclusions. Three studies compared combined psychological and pharmacological therapies with pharmacological therapies alone, and one study compared combined psychological and pharmacological therapies with psychotherapeutic therapies alone; however, the evidence was too small and uncertain to draw any high quality conclusions. Two studies reported data on the direct comparison of two antidepressants, but again the evidence was too small and uncertain to draw conclusions. Currently, it is uncertain whether continued or maintained pharmacotherapy (or both) with the reviewed antidepressant agents is a robust treatment for preventing relapse and recurrence in people with PDD due to moderate or high risk of bias as well as clinical heterogeneity in the analyzed studies; for all other comparisons, the body of evidence was too small to draw any final conclusions, although continued or maintained psychotherapy might be effective compared to no treatment. There is a need for more high quality trials of psychological interventions, and further studies should address health-related quality of life and adverse events more precisely, as well as assessing follow-up data.","Depressive disorders that persist for at least two years cause considerable problems; even after successful treatment, they frequently recur, and common treatments are antidepressant medicines and psychological treatments (talking therapies), or a combination of both, with long-term treatments intended to prevent the recurrence of depressive symptoms. People with persisting depression (longer than two years), friends, families, and carers, as well as general practitioners, psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, psychological therapists, and pharmacists, will be interested in this review. In adults with persistent depression who improved with acute (short-term) treatment, the review aimed to determine whether receiving continued antidepressant medicine, psychological treatment, or a combination of both is more effective in preventing recurrence of depression compared to placebo (a pretended treatment) or care as usual; whether receiving continued antidepressant medicine, psychological treatment, or a combination of both is equally accepted as receiving placebo or usual care; and whether one treatment is more effective or more accepted than another. We searched medical databases and other sources to find all relevant studies completed up to September 2018, and the studies had to compare antidepressant treatment, psychological treatment, or a combination of both, with each other, with placebo, or with care as usual for preventing recurrence of depression in adults diagnosed with persistent depression; we included 10 studies involving 840 participants. Five studies compared antidepressant medicine with placebo; one study compared psychological therapies versus attention placebo/non-specific control; one study compared psychotherapy with medication; three studies compared combined psychological and pharmacological therapies with pharmacological therapies alone; one study compared combined psychological and pharmacological therapies with psychotherapeutic therapies alone; and two studies compared two different antidepressants with each other. Overall, the included studies were at low-to-moderate risk of bias. According to GRADE, there was moderate quality evidence that participants taking medication treatment probably had less relapses/recurrences and may have lower dropouts than those taking placebo; the risk of depression returning in participants receiving a placebo (instead of antidepressant medicine) was 34%, whereas participants who remained on antidepressant medicines had a lower risk for recurrence of 13%, with continued treatment lasting between four months and two years. Antidepressants were as well accepted as placebo; however, as most of the included studies showed risk of bias and there were some inconsistent results between the different studies, it cannot be concluded with certainty whether continued or maintained pharmacotherapy (or both) is a convincing treatment for people with PDD. Additionally, as studies on the long-term effects of medication are lacking, recommendations on the necessary duration of medication treatment cannot be drawn. The benefits of psychological therapies or combined treatment remained unclear due to the small number of studies. This review cannot provide clear, certain evidence regarding whether continued antidepressant medication (compared to placebo tablet) reduces the risk of depression recurring in adults with persistent depression; however, only a few studies have been done, and further studies should especially address psychological and combined long-term treatments.",1116,Persistent depressive disorder; acute interventions; remission; continuation and maintenance therapy; psychotherapy,What might be the implications of the study's findings for the long-term management of persistent depressive disorder (PDD)?,What is the primary focus of the study?,Select all of the following that are fruits,Which treatments were compared in the study?,How are long-term treatments intended to benefit patients with persistent depression?,Continued antidepressant medication offers a definitive solution to prevent recurrence.; Psychotherapy could potentially be more effective but requires further research.; There is uncertainty regarding the efficacy of combined treatments due to limited data.,Psychotherapy could potentially be more effective but requires further research.; There is uncertainty regarding the efficacy of combined treatments due to limited data.,Assessing continuation and maintenance treatments for persistent depression; Investigating new antidepressant medications; Studying short-term interventions for depression,Assessing continuation and maintenance treatments for persistent depression,dog; blue; grape,grape,Antidepressant medications versus placebo; Psychological therapies versus attention placebo; Lifestyle interventions versus exercise,Antidepressant medications versus placebo; Psychological therapies versus attention placebo,Preventing recurrence of depressive symptoms; Eliminating depressive symptoms completely; Providing immediate relief from symptoms,Preventing recurrence of depressive symptoms

It is associated with high healthcare costs, partly driven by frequent hospital readmissions. Disease management interventions may help to manage people with heart failure in a more proactive, preventative way than drug therapy alone. This is the second update of a review published in 2005 and updated in 2012.
To compare the effects of different disease management interventions for heart failure (which are not purely educational in focus), with usual care, in terms of death, hospital readmissions, quality of life and cost-related outcomes.
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL for this review update on 9 January 2018 and two clinical trials registries on 4 July 2018. We applied no language restrictions.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with at least six months' follow-up, comparing disease management interventions to usual care for adults who had been admitted to hospital at least once with a diagnosis of heart failure. There were three main types of intervention: case management; clinic-based interventions; multidisciplinary interventions.
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Outcomes of interest were mortality due to heart failure, mortality due to any cause, hospital readmission for heart failure, hospital readmission for any cause, adverse effects, quality of life, costs and cost-effectiveness.
We found 22 new RCTs, so now include 47 RCTs (10,869 participants). Twenty-eight were case management interventions, seven were clinic-based models, nine were multidisciplinary interventions, and three could not be categorised as any of these. The included studies were predominantly in an older population, with most studies reporting a mean age of between 67 and 80 years. Seven RCTs were in upper-middle-income countries, the rest were in high-income countries. Only two multidisciplinary-intervention RCTs reported mortality due to heart failure. Pooled analysis gave a risk ratio (RR) of 0.46 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23 to 0.95), but the very low-quality evidence means we are uncertain of the effect on mortality due to heart failure. Based on this limited evidence, the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) is 12 (95% CI 9 to 126). Twenty-six case management RCTs reported all-cause mortality, with low-quality evidence indicating that these may reduce all-cause mortality (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.90; NNTB 25, 95% CI 17 to 54). We pooled all seven clinic-based studies, with low-quality evidence suggesting they may make little to no difference to all-cause mortality. Pooled analysis of eight multidisciplinary studies gave moderate-quality evidence that these probably reduce all-cause mortality (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.83; NNTB 17, 95% CI 12 to 32). We pooled data on heart failure readmissions from 12 case management studies. Moderate-quality evidence suggests that they probably reduce heart failure readmissions (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.78; NNTB 8, 95% CI 6 to 13). We were able to pool only two clinic-based studies, and the moderate-quality evidence suggested that there is probably little or no difference in heart failure readmissions between clinic-based interventions and usual care (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.18). Pooled analysis of five multidisciplinary interventions gave low-quality evidence that these may reduce the risk of heart failure readmissions (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.92; NNTB 11, 95% CI 7 to 44). Meta-analysis of 14 RCTs gave moderate-quality evidence that case management probably slightly reduces all-cause readmissions (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.01); a decrease from 491 to 451 in 1000 people (95% CI 407 to 495). Pooling four clinic-based RCTs gave low-quality and somewhat heterogeneous evidence that these may result in little or no difference in all-cause readmissions (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.12). Low-quality evidence from five RCTs indicated that multidisciplinary interventions may slightly reduce all-cause readmissions (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.01); a decrease from 450 to 383 in 1000 people (95% CI 320 to 455). Neither case management nor clinic-based intervention RCTs reported adverse effects. Two multidisciplinary interventions reported that no adverse events occurred. GRADE assessment of moderate quality suggested that there may be little or no difference in adverse effects between multidisciplinary interventions and usual care. Quality of life was generally poorly reported, with high attrition. Low-quality evidence means we are uncertain about the effect of case management and multidisciplinary interventions on quality of life. Four clinic-based studies reported quality of life but we could not pool them due to differences in reporting. Low-quality evidence indicates that clinic-based interventions may result in little or no difference in quality of life. Four case management programmes had cost-effectiveness analyses, and seven reported cost data. Low-quality evidence indicates that these may reduce costs and may be cost-effective. Two clinic-based studies reported cost savings. Low-quality evidence indicates that clinic-based interventions may reduce costs slightly. Low-quality data from one multidisciplinary intervention suggested this may be cost-effective from a societal perspective but less so from a health-services perspective.
We found limited evidence for the effect of disease management programmes on mortality due to heart failure, with few studies reporting this outcome. Case management may reduce all-cause mortality, and multidisciplinary interventions probably also reduce all-cause mortality, but clinic-based interventions had little or no effect on all-cause mortality. Readmissions due to heart failure or any cause were probably reduced by case-management interventions. Clinic-based interventions probably make little or no difference to heart failure readmissions and may result in little or no difference in readmissions for any cause. Multidisciplinary interventions may reduce the risk of readmission for heart failure or for any cause. There was a lack of evidence for adverse effects, and conclusions on quality of life remain uncertain due to poor-quality data. Variations in study location and time of occurrence hamper attempts to review costs and cost-effectiveness. The potential to improve quality of life is an important consideration but remains poorly reported. Improved reporting in future trials would strengthen the evidence for this patient-relevant outcome.","We investigated the effects of disease management programmes on death from heart failure or from any cause, hospital readmissions for heart failure or for any cause, adverse effects, quality of life and cost-effectiveness, in adults who had been admitted to hospital at least once for heart failure. Heart failure affects a person's quality of life, is a frequent cause of hospital admission and has a high risk of death. Traditional drug therapy is the main treatment, but people may benefit from additional support from disease management programmes that aim to provide ongoing support rather than crisis management. Such programmes may be run by specialist nurses, as clinic-based interventions, or by multidisciplinary teams. Community-based support of this kind could help to keep people out of hospital by improving day-to-day symptom management and providing an early warning system for changes requiring medical attention. We conducted a comprehensive search for all studies investigating heart failure-specific disease management interventions for adults who had been admitted to hospital at least once for heart failure (evidence current to 9 January 2018). We included 47 studies, with a total of 10,869 participants. Twenty-eight studies were case management interventions, seven were clinic-based models, nine were multidisciplinary interventions and three could not be categorised as any of these. The average age of the people in most of the studies was between 67 and 80 years old, although 10 studies had younger participants on average, and one included mostly very elderly people. Most trials were in Europe and North America, but others took place in China, Taiwan, Iran and Japan. We found limited evidence for an effect on mortality due to heart failure, as few studies reported this outcome. There was some evidence that case management may reduce all-cause mortality, and multidisciplinary interventions probably do, but clinic-based studies appeared to have little or no effect on this. Readmissions due to heart failure and due to any cause were probably reduced by case management interventions. Clinic-based interventions probably make little or no difference to heart failure readmissions and may result in little or no difference in readmissions for any cause. Multidisciplinary interventions may reduce the risk of readmission for heart failure or any cause. Only two studies mentioned adverse events, both stating that none occurred. Many studies measured quality of life, but it is difficult to draw conclusions for any effect because they tended to report this in different ways and did not report it for all their participants. Data on costs and cost-effectiveness were limited, but indicated a slight benefit of disease management programmes, mostly due to reduced hospital readmission costs. The quality of evidence was very low for mortality due to heart failure, low to moderate for all-cause mortality, low to moderate for heart failure readmissions, and all-cause readmissions, moderate for adverse events (where available), low to very low for quality of life and low to moderate for costs. The quality of evidence is important as it impacts on how certain we can be in the effect of the intervention on the outcomes we are interested in. For example, if the evidence is of very low quality, we cannot be certain of the intervention's effect.",1033,Disease management interventions; Heart failure; Hospital readmissions; All-cause mortality; Case management interventions; Multidisciplinary interventions; Clinic-based interventions; Quality of life; Adverse effects; Mortality due to heart failure,How do case management interventions compare with clinic-based interventions in terms of reducing all-cause mortality?,What were the primary motivations for exploring disease management programs for heart failure?,Select all of the following that are colors,How does the study describe the effect of multidisciplinary interventions on all-cause mortality?,Identify the populations studied in the trials included in the research.,Case management may reduce all-cause mortality.; Clinic-based interventions showed significant reductions in all-cause mortality.; Both interventions had the same effect on all-cause mortality.,Case management may reduce all-cause mortality.,To provide ongoing support rather than crisis management; To replace traditional drug therapy entirely; To reduce hospital readmissions and improve quality of life,To provide ongoing support rather than crisis management; To reduce hospital readmissions and improve quality of life,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,They probably reduce all-cause mortality; They have no impact on all-cause mortality; They increase all-cause mortality,They probably reduce all-cause mortality,Adults admitted to hospital at least once for heart failure; Children with congenital heart conditions; Elderly patients in nursing homes,Adults admitted to hospital at least once for heart failure
5db0a97f127d4000117cdfa0,interactive_4,Psychosocial interventions for the prevention of disability following traumatic physical injury,"Traumatic physical injury can result in many disabling sequelae including physical and mental health problems and impaired social functioning.
To assess the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions in the prevention of physical, mental and social disability following traumatic physical injury.
The search was not restricted by date, language or publication status. We searched the following electronic databases; Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 1), MEDLINE (Ovid SP), EMBASE (Ovid SP), PsycINFO (Ovid SP), Controlled Trials metaRegister (www.controlled-trials.com), AMED (Allied & Complementary Medicine), ISI Web of Science: Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI), PubMed. We also screened the reference lists of all selected papers and contacted authors of relevant studies. The latest search for trials was in February 2008.
Randomised controlled trials that consider one or more defined psychosocial interventions for the prevention of physical disability, mental health problems or reduced social functioning as a result of traumatic physical injury. We excluded studies that included patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Two authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of search results, reviewed the full text of potentially relevant studies, independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. We included five studies, involving 756 participants. Three studies assessed the effect of brief psychological therapies, one assessed the impact of a self-help booklet, and one the effect of collaborative care. The disparate nature of the trials covering different patient populations, interventions and outcomes meant that it was not possible to pool data meaningfully across studies. There was no evidence of a protective effect of brief psychological therapy or educational booklets on preventing disability. There was evidence from one trial of a reduction in both post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depressive symptoms one month after injury in those who received a collaborative care intervention combined with a brief psycho-educational intervention, however this was not retained at follow up. Overall mental health status was the only disability outcome affected by any intervention. In three trials the psychosocial intervention had a detrimental effect on the mental health status of patients. This review provides no convincing evidence of the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for the prevention of disability following traumatic physical injury. Taken together, our findings cannot be considered as supporting the provision of psychosocial interventions to prevent aspects of disability arising from physical injury. However, these conclusions are based on a small number of disparate trials with small to moderate sample sizes and are therefore necessarily cautious. More research, using larger sample sizes, and similar interventions and patient populations to enable pooling of results, is needed before these findings can be confirmed.","Traumatic physical injury such as that resulting from road traffic accidents, falls and fires can cause high levels of subsequent disability in the person affected. This may include physical disability as a result of the initial injury and subsequent complications, mental health problems such as depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a result of the trauma of the event which caused the injury and the resulting physical and social problems, and social problems such as loss of social life and unemployment. It is therefore important to evaluate interventions which seek to prevent these adverse secondary outcomes. Psychosocial interventions, which include psychological therapies such as interpersonal counselling and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), and social interventions such as befriending, social support and self-help advice, delivered soon after the injury, may help to prevent these problems.
This review identified five randomised controlled trials, involving 756 participants, which evaluated psychosocial interventions for the prevention of disability following traumatic injury. No convincing evidence was found supporting the efficacy of these interventions. In particular, self-help booklets and interpersonal therapies had no effect on preventing disability. There was some evidence that a more complex intervention involving collaborative care reduced symptoms of depression and PTSD in the short but not the medium term. There was evidence from three trials that psychosocial interventions had a detrimental effect on mental health. Taken together, our findings cannot be taken as supporting the provision of psychosocial interventions to prevent aspects of disability arising from physical injury. These results suggest that future interventions should focus on screening patients at risk of poor outcomes and only treating those who develop subsequent problems. However, the strength of these conclusions is limited by the small size and varied nature of many of the trials, which means that their results cannot be pooled.",1060,psychosocial interventions; traumatic physical injury; disabling sequelae; physical disability; mental health problems; social functioning; collaborative care; post-traumatic stress disorder; depressive symptoms; psycho-educational intervention,What types of disabilities can traumatic physical injury cause?,Identify the primary purpose of evaluating psychosocial interventions in the context of traumatic injuries.,Select all of the following that are colors,Which psychosocial intervention showed short-term efficacy in reducing depressive symptoms?,Explain the overall finding regarding the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions after a traumatic injury.,Physical and mental health problems; Improved social interactions; Increased employment opportunities,Physical and mental health problems,To prevent adverse secondary outcomes; To reduce the cost of medical treatments; To enhance physical strength,To prevent adverse secondary outcomes,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Collaborative care intervention; Self-help booklet; Interpersonal therapy,Collaborative care intervention,No convincing evidence supports their efficacy; Effective in preventing all types of disability; Significantly improved physical recovery,No convincing evidence supports their efficacy
5db0a97f127d4000117cdfa0,interactive_4,Thienopyridine derivatives versus aspirin for preventing stroke and other serious vascular events in high vascular risk patients,"Aspirin is the most widely studied and prescribed antiplatelet agent for preventing serious vascular events, reducing the odds of such events among high vascular risk patients by about a quarter. Thienopyridine derivatives inhibit platelet activation by a different mechanism and so may be more effective. To determine the effectiveness and safety of thienopyridine derivatives (ticlopidine and clopidogrel) versus aspirin for preventing serious vascular events (stroke, myocardial infarction (MI) or vascular death) in patients at high risk, and specifically in patients with a previous TIA or ischaemic stroke. We searched the trials registers of the Stroke, Heart and Peripheral Vascular Diseases Cochrane Review Groups (last searched July 2008), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2008), MEDLINE (1966 to August 2008) and EMBASE (1980 to August 2008). We also searched reference lists of relevant papers, and contacted other researchers and the pharmaceutical company Sanofi-BMS (December 2008). All unconfounded, double blind, randomised trials directly comparing a thienopyridine derivative with aspirin in high vascular risk patients. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. We sought additional data from the principal investigators of the largest trials. We included 10 trials involving 26,865 high vascular risk patients. The trials were generally of high quality. Aspirin was compared with ticlopidine in nine trials (7633 patients) and with clopidogrel in one trial (19,185 patients). Compared with aspirin, allocation to a thienopyridine produced a modest, just statistically significant, reduction in the odds of a serious vascular event (11.6% versus 12.5%; odds ratio (OR) 0.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85 to 0.99), corresponding to the avoidance of 10 (95% CI 0 to 20) serious vascular events per 1000 patients treated for about two years. However, the wide confidence interval includes the possibility of negligible additional benefit. Compared with aspirin, thienopyridines significantly reduced gastrointestinal adverse effects. However, thienopyridines increased the odds of skin rash and diarrhoea, ticlopidine more than clopidogrel. Allocation to ticlopidine, but not clopidogrel, significantly increased the odds of neutropenia. In patients with TIA/ischaemic stroke, the results were similar to those for all patients combined. The thienopyridine derivatives are at least as effective as aspirin in preventing serious vascular events in patients at high risk, and possibly somewhat more so. However, the size of any additional benefit is uncertain and could be negligible. Clopidogrel has a more favourable adverse effects profile than ticlopidine and so is the thienopyridine of choice. It should be used as an alternative to aspirin in patients genuinely intolerant of or allergic to aspirin.","Most strokes and heart attacks are caused by a blood clot blocking the blood supply to part of the brain (to cause stroke) or to the heart (to cause a heart attack). Aspirin prevents blood clots forming, and it can reduce the risk of a further heart attack or stroke in people who have had a stroke or heart attack or other symptoms of vascular disease. Clopidogrel and ticlopidine are two similar drugs called thienopyridines which prevent clots in a different way to aspirin. This review of 10 trials comparing either clopidogrel or ticlopidine with aspirin in about 27,000 people found that clopidogrel and ticlopidine were at least as effective as aspirin for the prevention of stroke and heart attacks, and might be slightly more effective. In terms of adverse effects, compared with aspirin, clopidogrel and ticlopidine caused less stomach upset and less bleeding from the gut, but more diarrhoea and skin rash. Ticlopidine produced more of these last two adverse effects than clopidogrel when compared with aspirin. Ticlopidine can also cause suppression of the bone marrow production of blood cells, which can be a serious complication. Clopidogrel is therefore the thienopyridine of choice since it is safer and better tolerated. However, since it is substantially more expensive than aspirin and not clearly more effective, it should generally only be used instead of aspirin in patients who are unable to take aspirin.",1071,Antiplatelet agent; Thienopyridine derivatives; Platelet activation; Vascular events; Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA); Ticlopidine; Clopidogrel; Gastrointestinal adverse effects; Neutropenia; Adverse effects profile,What is the primary purpose of aspirin in patients with previous stroke or heart attack?,Which of the following describes the main comparison in the study?,Select all of the following that are colors,"According to the summary, what were the two main adverse effects more common with thienopyridines?",Which thienopyridine is recommended as an alternative to aspirin based on its safety profile?,To prevent blood clots from forming; To cure strokes and heart attacks; To increase bone marrow production,To prevent blood clots from forming,Comparing thienopyridines with aspirin; Comparing aspirin with placebos; Comparing ticlopidine with clopidogrel,Comparing thienopyridines with aspirin,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Diarrhoea and skin rash; Heart attack and stroke; Neutropenia and bone pain,Diarrhoea and skin rash,Clopidogrel; Ticlopidine; Aspirin,Clopidogrel
5db0a97f127d4000117cdfa0,finetuned_5,Treatments to reduce body temperature to 35C in people who are in hospital after a traumatic brain injury,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and disability, with an estimated 5.5 million people experiencing severe TBI worldwide every year. Observational clinical studies suggest a link between raised body temperature and unfavourable outcomes, though findings are inconsistent. Preclinical models indicate that reducing temperature to 35C to 37.5C may improve biological outcomes compared to deeper cooling (33C). It remains unknown whether reducing body temperature to 35C in people admitted to hospital with TBI is beneficial, neutral, or harmful. This review updates a previous version published in 2014. We aimed to assess the effects of pharmacological or physical interventions designed to reduce body temperature to 35C in adults and children hospitalised after TBI. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, PubMed, clinical trial registers, grey literature, reference lists, and forward citations up to 28 November 2019. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving participants of any age admitted after TBI and receiving interventions intended to lower body temperature within the target range, including medications (paracetamol, NSAIDs) or physical cooling methods (surface cooling devices, bedside fans, cooled intravenous fluids). Eligible comparators were placebo or usual care. Two authors independently assessed studies, extracted data, and evaluated risk of bias, using GRADE to assess certainty of evidence. Only one RCT with 41 adult participants, conducted in two Australian intensive care units, met the criteria. Participants received intravenous paracetamol (1 g every four hours for 72 hours) or a matched placebo. We were uncertain whether paracetamol influenced 28-day mortality (risk ratio 2.86, 95% CI 0.32 to 25.24). The certainty of evidence was very low due to imprecision (small sample size) and selective reporting concerns, although other risks of bias were low. The study did not report the primary outcome of poor outcome at follow-up (death or dependency) or any secondary outcomes of interest, including intracranial or extracranial haemorrhage, abnormal intracranial pressure, or pneumonia or other serious infections. We found one additional completed trial of a physical intervention (advanced fever control using a surface cooling device versus standard fever control in 12 participants), but it was published only as an abstract with insufficient details for inclusion; it is listed as awaiting classification pending further information. Four ongoing trials may contribute data to future updates if they report relevant outcomes and provide separate results for participants with TBI when mixed populations are included. In conclusion, one small study contributed very low-certainty evidence on mortality. Overall uncertainty is driven by extremely limited research on interventions aimed at reducing body temperature to 35C after TBI. More research evaluating both pharmacological and physical interventions is needed. Future studies should include outcomes important to patients, such as side effects (e.g., nausea, vomiting) and discomfort caused by cooling therapies.","Traumatic brain injury occurs when direct force to the headsuch as from a road traffic accident or a fall causes damage to the brain. It is a major global health problem, affecting about 5.5 million people each year. Injury occurs in two stages: first at the moment of impact, and then over the following hours to weeks as secondary damage develops. Treatment aims to limit this secondary damage. Some evidence suggests that people with normal body temperature after injury may have better outcomes than those with elevated temperatures. This review examined whether medicines or non-drug physical cooling methods that reduce body temperature to between 35C improve outcomes for adults or children hospitalized after traumatic brain injury. We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs)the most reliable type of evidence up to 28 November 2019. Only one small RCT with 41 participants was found. It compared intravenous paracetamol, given for 72 hours, with an intravenous salt solution made to look identical. No published trials assessed other medicines or physical cooling methods such as cooling blankets, ice, fans, or cooled fluids. One very small study of physical cooling was identified but lacked enough information for inclusion, and four ongoing studies may provide future evidence. Some of these include mixed types of brain injury, and we will only be able to use them if they report traumatic brain injury results separately. We were uncertain whether paracetamol reduced deaths within 28 days because the study was very small and did not originally plan to report mortality. It also did not report any of our key outcomes, such as poor functional outcome (death or dependency), serious bleeding inside or outside the brain, raised intracranial pressure, pneumonia, or other infections. Although the study methods were generally sound, the lack of pre-specified reporting increased the risk of bias. With only one small study, the certainty of the evidence was very low, meaning the true effects may be very different from what was reported. Overall, we remain uncertain whether medicines or physical cooling treatments that lower body temperature to 35C benefit people in hospital after traumatic brain injury. More and larger studies are needed, and future updates will assess side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and discomfort, which we hope ongoing and future research will report.",1056,Traumatic brain injury; pharmacological interventions; physical cooling methods; certainty of evidence; imprecision; intracranial pressure; extracranial haemorrhage; pneumonia; advanced fever control,What were the motivations for the study's focus on cooling treatments for TBI?,Which factors contributed to the uncertainty of the study results on paracetamol?,Select all of the following that are colors,"Based on the study, what can be concluded about the use of cooling methods in reducing TBI mortality rates?",Explain the main goal of the study in your own words.,Elevated body temperatures suggest potentially worse outcomes for TBI patients.; Normal body temperature is universally accepted to improve brain injury outcomes.; Cooling treatments have been consistently proven in other unrelated medical contexts.,Elevated body temperatures suggest potentially worse outcomes for TBI patients.,The study used a too short duration of treatment.; The small sample size and lack of pre-planned mortality reporting.; The study confirmed that all key outcomes were reported comprehensively.,The small sample size and lack of pre-planned mortality reporting.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,The study provides strong evidence that cooling methods reduce mortality.; Cooling methods' impact on mortality is uncertain due to the study's limited scope.; Mortality rates increase significantly with the use of cooling methods.,Cooling methods' impact on mortality is uncertain due to the study's limited scope.,To determine if cooling to 35-37.5Â°C improves outcomes after TBI; To establish the best surgical intervention for TBI; To identify genetic markers of TBI,To determine if cooling to 35-37.5Â°C improves outcomes after TBI
5db0a97f127d4000117cdfa0,finetuned_6,Exercise for type 2 diabetes mellitus,"Exercise is generally recommended for people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, some studies evaluate an exercise intervention including diet or behaviour modification or both, and the effects of diet and exercise are not differentiated. Some exercise studies involve low participant numbers, lacking power to show significant differences which may appear in larger trials.
To assess the effects of exercise in type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Trials were identified through the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and manual searches of bibliographies.
All randomised controlled trials comparing any type of well-documented aerobic, fitness or progressive resistance training exercise with no exercise in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Two authors independently selected trials, assessed trial quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information. Any information on adverse effects was collected from the trials.
Fourteen randomised controlled trials comparing exercise against no exercise in type 2 diabetes were identified involving 377 participants. Trials ranged from eight weeks to twelve months duration. Compared with the control, the exercise intervention significantly improved glycaemic control as indicated by a decrease in glycated haemoglobin levels of 0.6% (-0.6 % HbA1c, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.9 to -0.3; P < 0.05). This result is both statistically and clinically significant. There was no significant difference between groups in whole body mass, probably due to an increase in fat free mass (muscle) with exercise, as reported in one trial (6.3 kg, 95% CI 0.0 to 12.6). There was a reduction in visceral adipose tissue with exercise (-45.5 cm2, 95% CI -63.8 to -27.3), and subcutaneous adipose tissue also decreased. No study reported adverse effects in the exercise group or diabetic complications. The exercise intervention significantly increased insulin response (131 AUC, 95% CI 20 to 242) (one trial), and decreased plasma triglycerides (-0.25 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.48 to -0.02). No significant difference was found between groups in quality of life (one trial), plasma cholesterol or blood pressure.
The meta-analysis shows that exercise significantly improves glycaemic control and reduces visceral adipose tissue and plasma triglycerides, but not plasma cholesterol, in people with type 2 diabetes, even without weight loss.","Exercise, dietary changes and medications are frequently used in the management of type 2 diabetes. However, it is difficult to determine the independent effect of exercise from some trials because exercise has been combined with dietary modifications or medications, or compared with a control which includes another form of intervention. The review authors aimed to determine the effect of exercise on blood sugar control in type 2 diabetes.This review found that exercise improves blood sugar control and that this effect is evident even without weight loss. Furthermore, exercise decreases body fat content, thus the failure to lose weight with exercise programmes is probably explained by the conversion of fat to muscle. Exercise improved the body's reaction to insulin and decreased blood lipids. Quality of life was only assessed in one study, which found no difference between the two groups. No significant difference was found between groups in blood levels of cholesterol or blood pressure. A total of 14 randomised controlled trials were assessed. These included 377 participants and compared groups that differed only with respect to an exercise programme intervention. The duration of the interventions in the studies ranged from eight weeks to one year. Two studies reported follow-up information, one at six months after the end of the six month exercise intervention and one at twelve months post-intervention. Generally, the studies were well-conducted, but blinding of outcome assessors was not reported and although all studies reported that randomisation was performed, few gave details of the method. No adverse effects with exercise were reported. The effect of exercise on diabetic complications was not assessed in any of the studies.
The relatively short duration of trials prevented the reporting of any significant long term complications or mortality. Another limitation was the small number of participants included in the analyses for adiposity, blood pressure, cholesterol, body's muscle and quality of life.",1001,glycaemic control; glycated haemoglobin; type 2 diabetes mellitus; visceral adipose tissue; plasma triglycerides; exercise intervention; subcutaneous adipose tissue; insulin response; HbA1c; fat free mass,How might researchers justify the clinical relevance of the findings despite no noted weight loss in participants?,What was the main aim of the review authors?,Select all of the following that are fruits,Which outcome did exercise improve in type 2 diabetes management?,What was a significant effect of exercise identified in the trials?,Improvements in insulin response and decreased body fat; Lack of adverse effects from exercise interventions; Extended duration of exercise interventions,Improvements in insulin response and decreased body fat,To determine the effect of exercise on blood sugar control in type 2 diabetes.; To compare dietary and exercise interventions.; To analyze medication effects on type 2 diabetes.,To determine the effect of exercise on blood sugar control in type 2 diabetes.,dog; blue; grape,grape,Blood sugar control; Blood cholesterol levels; Blood pressure,Blood sugar control,Decreased body fat content; Increased overall body weight; Higher energy expenditure,Decreased body fat content
5db0a97f127d4000117cdfa0,finetuned_6,"Education, incentive, and engineering-based interventions to promotethe use of seat belts","Over 1.3 million people die each year as a result of traffic collisions and hundreds of thousands of others are permanently and seriouslyinjured. Most of these deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries, where mortality rates can be up to 10 times higher than those ofsome high-income countries. Seat belts are designed to accomplish two key functions: to prevent the occupant from being ejected fromthe vehicle by the force of impact, and to extend the time that the decelerating force is applied to a person. Seat belts also spread the area ofimpact both to larger and less vulnerable parts of the body. Since the 1950s, seat belts have been factory-fitted to most vehicles, and todayaround 90% of high-income countries have adopted seat belt legislation that makes it mandatory for some, if not all, vehicle occupants towear seat belts. However, the simple passing of laws is not sufficient to ensure seat belt use, and, while the enforcement of seat belt lawsdoes increase seat belt use, other interventions have been developed to encourage voluntary  and hence sustainable behaviour change. To evaluate the benefits of behavioural-change interventions (educational-based, incentive-based, engineering-based, or a combination,but not enforcement-based) that promote the use of seat belts, and to determine which types of interventions are most effective. On 9 August 2022, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), OvidSP Embase, OvidSP MEDLINE, 14other databases, and clinical trials registers. We also screened reference lists and conference proceedings, searched websites of relevantorganisations, and contacted road safety experts. The search was performed with no restrictions in terms of language and date ofpublication. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), both individually randomised and cluster-randomised, that evaluated education,engineering, incentive-based interventions (or combinations) that promoted seat belt use. Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of RCTs, evaluated the risk of bias, and extracted data. We performed a narrativesynthesis based on effect direction due to the heterogeneity observed between RCTs and reported the synthesis in accordance with reporting guidelines for systematic reviews without meta-analysis, as appropriate. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using theGRADE approach. We analysed data on the primary outcome, frequency of wearing a seat belt. None of the included RCTs reported theother primary outcome, crash-related injury rate or the secondary outcome, crash-related mortality rates of interest in this review. We included 15 completed RCTs (12 individual, parallel-group, and three cluster) that enroled 12,081 participants, published between1990 and 2022. Four trials were published between 2019 and 2022, and the remaining trials were published 10 or more years ago. Wealso identified four ongoing RCTs. Thirteen RCTs were conducted in the USA. Trials recruited participants from various sites (worksites,schools, emergency departments, a residential retirement community, and primary care settings) and different age groups (adults,late adolescents, early adolescents, and dyads). Thirteen trials investigated educational interventions, one of which used education inaddition to incentives (one of the intervention arms) measured through participant self-reports (12) and observation (one), and two trialsinvestigated engineering-based interventions measured through in-vehicle data monitor systems at various follow-up periods (six weeksto 36 months). We grouped RCTs according to types of education-based interventions: behavioural education-based, health risk appraisal (HRA), andother education-based interventions. The evidence suggests that behavioural education-based (four trials) interventions may promoteseat belt use and HRA interventions (one trial) likely promote seat belt use in the short term (six weeks to nine months). Four of the sixtrials that investigated behavioural education-based interventions found that the intervention compared to no or another interventionmay promote seat belt use. These effects were measured through participant self-report and at various time points (six-week to 12-monthfollow-up) (low-certainty evidence). One of the three trials investigating HRA only or with additional intervention versus no or anotherintervention showed observed effects likely to promote seat belt use (moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence suggests that engineering-based interventions using vehicle monitoring systems (with in-vehicle alerts and with or withoutnotifications/feedback) may promote the use of seat belts. One trial showed that engineering interventions (in-vehicle alerts and feedback)may promote seat belt use while the other showed unclear effects in two of the three intervention groups (low-certainty evidence). Bothtrials had small sample sizes and high baseline seat belt use. The evidence suggests that behavioural education-based interventions may promote seat belt use and HRA (including incentives) with orwithout additional interventions likely promote seat belt use. Likewise, for engineering-based interventions using in-vehicle data monitorsystems with in-vehicle alerts, with or without notifications/feedback the evidence suggests the interventions may promote the use ofseat belts. Well-designed RCTs are needed to further investigate the effectiveness of education and engineering-based interventions. High-qualitytrials that examine the potential benefits of incentives to promote seat belt use, either alone or in combination with other interventions, aswell as trials to investigate other types of interventions (such as technology, media/publicity, enforcement, insurance schemes, employerprogrammes, etc.) to promote the use of seat belts, are needed. Evidence from low- and middle-income economies is required to improvethe generalisability of the data. In addition, research focused on determining which interventions or types of interventions are mosteffective in different population groups is needed.","Why is wearing a seat belt important? Many people, mostly children and young adults, die each year as a result of road traffic injuries suggesting it to be a leading cause of death with around 75% of traffic-related deaths occurring among young males. Many others are permanently and seriously injured. Seat belts are designed to protect occupants from being thrown out of the vehicle by the force of impact, and spread the impact across less vulnerable parts of the body to lessen the damage. Passing laws mandating seat belt use is not sufficient to encourage seat belt use on its own. We investigated the effectiveness of education, incentive, or engineering-based interventions, but not law enforcement, to encourage seat belt use and determine which types of interventions are most effective. Educational-based interventions are structured programmes teaching drivers and passengers the importance of using seat belts. Engineering-based interventions are design changes to the vehicle structure that promote the wearing of seat belts, such as seat belt alarms, while incentives include rewards schemes. We searched for studies that randomly allocated people travelling in passenger or commercial vehicles to interventions aiming to improve seat belt use. We excluded people travelling in farming or agricultural vehicles since these are not deemed commercial vehicles. Two review authors independently evaluated studies to judge inclusion in the review. We recorded information about the study design, setting, participants, interventions, and outcomes. In terms of outcome, we looked at the frequency of wearing a seat belt as well as crash-related injuries and deaths. Because of the differences between the included studies, we provided a written account and assessed how much each result could be trusted using the ratings high, moderate, low, or very low quality, depending on our confidence in the reliability of the results. We summarised the findings and compared study results. We found 15 studies enrolling 12,081 participants and four ongoing studies. Thirteen studies were conducted in the USA and enrolled participants from various sites (worksites, schools, emergency departments, a residential retirement community, and primary care settings) and of different age groups (adults, late and early adolescents, and dyads of child/adolescent and parent/legal guardian). Twelve studies looked at educational interventions alone, one at education and incentives, and two at engineering-based interventions. All included studies reported on the frequency of wearing a seat belt; however, most studies (12) reported this outcome through participant self-reporting. The remaining studies reported the frequency of wearing a seat belt through in-vehicle data monitoring systems (two studies) and observation (one study). None of the included studies reported crash-related injuries and deaths. Some evidence suggests that education-based and engineering-based interventions may promote seat belt use; however, we cannot be confident in the current evidence. For education-based interventions, evidence suggests that behavioural-based (motivational interviews, behavioural change counselling, and behavioural messages) and HRA (alone or with educational information plus incentive) interventions may improve seat belt use in early adolescents, late adolescents, and adults. The evidence suggests that engineering-based interventions may promote seat belt use in early adolescents and adults. More research is needed to better understand the effectiveness of education- and engineering-based interventions on seat belt use. In addition, high-quality research is needed to investigate the benefit of incentives alone or in combination with other interventions as well as research to investigate other types of interventions, different combinations of interventions, settings (such as low- and middle-income countries), and populations. Only two studies looked at engineering-based interventions to improve seat belt use and both studies enrolled a small number of participants making it challenging to conclude that these interventions are beneficial. Trials investigating educational interventions to improve seat belt use vary in terms of the type of intervention, quality, number and types of people in the study, etc. Studies included children, adolescents, and adults; however, the most effective intervention for each population group remains unclear. Our confidence in the evidence was low or moderate, mainly due to the outcome (wearing seat belts) being measured through participant self-reporting. Self-reported outcomes are open to being influenced by participants answering in a manner they believe to be desirable or by participants' limited recollection of the event being studied.

The aim of this review was to assess the effects of conservative (non-surgical) interventions for treating hyperextension injuries of the PIP joints. We searched multiple databases and trial registers up to early 2012. Randomised and quasi-randomised studies comparing immobilisation, protected mobilisation, or unrestricted mobilisation in people with non-surgically managed PIP hyperextension injuries were eligible. Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data, but no pooling was possible. Three trials with 366 participants were identified; all were over 15 years old and had methodological weaknesses with unclear or high risk of bias. None reported self-assessed function. One trial compared unrestricted mobility with immobilisation, one compared protected mobilisation with immobilisation, and one compared immobilisation for one week versus three weeks. None found statistically significant differences between groups in poor outcomes, pain, or range of movement at six months, and for the unrestricted-mobility versus immobilisation comparison, no differences were found even at three years. Overall, evidence from trials is insufficient to guide decisions on whether immobilisation is needed, and if so, for how long or to what extent, when treating PIP hyperextension injuries.","Injury to the ligaments of the middle joint (proximal interphalangeal joint) of a finger may occur as a result of the finger being forced backwards. This is known as a hyperextension injury. Characteristically, this occurs in sporting accidents, such as where a football strikes an outstretched hand. These injuries are common and typically affect people of working age. Usually, these patients are treated without surgery using a combination of support (splinting/strapping to the adjacent finger) and exercise advice. Use of the hand is commonly encouraged but restricted to some degree by the severity of the injury. By examining the evidence from randomised controlled trials, this review aimed to assess which treatment for hyperextension injuries of the proximal interphalangeal joints of the fingers results in the best outcome for patients. The outcomes examined included function (including return to work), pain and joint movement.
Three small studies including a total of 366 patients met the inclusion criteria for the review. The studies, which were all over 15 years old, were prone to bias. None of the studies reported any self assessment of function by participants. One study compared unrestricted mobility with immobilisation. One trial compared protected mobilisation (using a removable support in combination with exercise) with immobilisation. The remaining study compared immobilisation for one week versus three weeks. None of these trials found important differences between their intervention groups in various measures of poor outcome, pain and range of movement at six months follow-up.

663ae3f35b81791c40865be5,static_2,Medicines to prevent breast cancer in women at above-average risk of developing breast cancer,"Breast cancer is the most frequently occurring malignancy and the second cause of death for cancer in women. Cancer prevention agents (CPAs) are a promising approach to reduce the burden of breast cancer. Currently, two main types of CPAs are available: selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs, such as tamoxifen and raloxifene) and aromatase inhibitors (AIs, such as exemestane and anastrozole).
To assess the efficacy and acceptability of single CPAs for the prevention of primary breast cancer, in unaffected women, at an above-average risk of developing breast cancer. Using a network meta-analysis, to rank single CPAs, based on their efficacy and acceptability (an endpoint that is defined as the inverse of CPA-related toxicity).
We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), and ClinicalTrials.gov on 17 August 2018. We handsearched reference lists to identify additional relevant studies.
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that enrolled women without a personal history of breast cancer but with an above-average risk of developing a tumor. Women had to be treated with a CPA and followed up to record the occurrence of breast cancer and adverse events.
Two review authors independently extracted data and conducted risk of bias assessments of the included studies, and assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. Outcome data included incidence of breast carcinoma (both invasive and in situ carcinoma) and adverse events (both overall and severe toxicity). We performed a conventional meta-analysis (for direct comparisons of a single CPA with placebo or a different CPA) and network meta-analysis (for indirect comparisons).
We included six studies enrolling 50,927 women randomized to receive one CPA (SERMs: tamoxifen or raloxifene, or AIs: exemestane or anastrozole) or placebo. Three studies compared tamoxifen and placebo, two studies compared AIs (exemestane or anastrozole) versus placebo, and one study compared tamoxifen versus raloxifene. The risk of bias was low for all RCTs. For the tamoxifen versus placebo comparison, tamoxifen likely resulted in a lower risk of developing breast cancer compared to placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 0.76; 3 studies, 22,832 women; moderate-certainty evidence). In terms of adverse events, tamoxifen likely increased the risk of severe toxicity compared to placebo (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.47; 2 studies, 20,361 women; moderate-certainty evidence). In particular, women randomized to receive tamoxifen experienced a higher incidence of both endometrial carcinoma (RR 2.26, 95% CI 1.52 to 3.38; high-certainty evidence) and thromboembolism (RR 2.10, 95% CI 1.14 to 3.89; high-certainty evidence) compared to women who received placebo. For the AIs versus placebo comparison, AIs (exemestane or anastrozole) reduced the risk of breast cancer by 53% (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.63; 2 studies, 8424 women; high-certainty evidence). In terms of adverse events, AIs increased the risk of severe toxicity by 18% (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.28; 2 studies, 8352 women; high-certainty evidence). These differences were sustained especially by endocrine (e.g. hot flashes), gastrointestinal (e.g. diarrhea), and musculoskeletal (e.g. arthralgia) adverse events, while there were no differences in endometrial cancer or thromboembolism rates between AIs and placebo. For the tamoxifen versus raloxifene comparison, raloxifene probably performed worse than tamoxifen in terms of breast cancer incidence reduction (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.43; 1 study, 19,490 women; moderate-certainty evidence), but its use was associated with lower toxicity rates (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.95; 1 study, 19,490 women; moderate-certainty evidence), particularly relating to incidence of endometrial cancer and thromboembolism. An indirect comparison of treatment effects allowed us to compare the SERMs and AIs in this review. In terms of efficacy, AIs (exemestane or anastrozole) may have reduced breast cancer incidence slightly compared to tamoxifen (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.98; 5 RCTs, 31,256 women); however, the certainty of evidence was low. A lack of model convergence did not allow us to analyze toxicity data.
For women with an above-average risk of developing breast cancer, CPAs can reduce the incidence of this disease. AIs appear to be more effective than SERMs (tamoxifen) in reducing the risk of developing breast cancer. AIs are not associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer and thromboembolic events. However, long-term data on toxicities from tamoxifen are available while the follow-up toxicity data on unaffected women taking AIs is relatively short. Additional data from direct comparisons are needed to fully address the issues of breast cancer prevention by risk-reducing medications, with special regards to acceptability (i.e. the benefit/harm ratio).","Breast cancer is the most frequent type of cancer and the second cause of death by cancer in women. Therefore, any strategy which can reduce its burden is eagerly awaited. Cancer prevention agents (CPAs) are medicines that might fulfil this need. Currently, two main types of CPAs are available to combat breast cancer: selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs, such as tamoxifen and raloxifene) and aromatase inhibitors (such as exemestane and anastrozole). Women without personal history of breast cancer, but with above-average risk of developing this disease (that is, with a lifetime risk greater than 17%) represent the usual target population for CPAs.
This Cochrane Review aimed to summarize the evidence on the efficacy and toxicity of CPAs for the prevention of primary breast cancer.
The review authors found six studies enrolling 50,927 women to receive one CPA or placebo (a pretend treatment, e.g. a sugar pill). Three studies involving 23,013 women compared tamoxifen and placebo, two studies involving 8424 women compared aromatase inhibitors (exemestane or anastrozole) and placebo, and one study involving 19,490 women that compared tamoxifen and raloxifene.
Based on the three studies that compared tamoxifen to placebo, tamoxifen probably reduced the risk of developing breast cancer by 32% compared to placebo. However, tamoxifen was associated with a 28% increased risk of severe side effects compared to placebo based on two studies involving 20,361 women. In particular, women taking tamoxifen experienced higher incidence of endometrial cancer and thromboembolism than women having no medicine.
For women who received either an aromatase inhibitor (exemestane or anastrozole) or placebo, aromatase inhibitors reduced the risk of breast cancer by 53% compared to placebo. Data from two studies involving 8352 women indicated that aromatase inhibitors increased the risk of severe side effects by 18% compared to placebo. These differences were sustained especially by endocrine (hormonal; e.g. hot flashes), gastrointestinal (e.g. diarrhea), and musculoskeletal (e.g. joint pain) side effects, whereas there were no differences in either endometrial cancer or thromboembolism rates.
For women who received either tamoxifen or raloxifene, raloxifene probably performed worse than tamoxifen in terms of breast cancer incidence reduction, but its use was associated with a 13% reduction of toxicity rates especially endometrial cancer and thromboembolism.
A specialized method named a 'network meta-analysis' allowed us to compare medications never directly compared to each other in a study. Based on this network meta-analysis, aromatase inhibitors may have led to a 23% additional risk reduction of developing breast cancer compared to tamoxifen. However, the reliability of the evidence was low meaning that further research is likely to have an impact on our confidence in this result.

663ae3f35b81791c40865be5,static_2,Is favipiravir useful in treating people with COVID-19?,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to challenge the health workforce and societies worldwide. Favipiravir was suggested by some experts to be effective and safe to use in COVID-19. Although this drug has been evaluated in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), it is still unclear if it has a definite role in the treatment of COVID-19. The aim of this Cochrane Review was to assess the effects of favipiravir compared to no treatment, supportive treatment, or other experimental antiviral treatment in people with acute COVID-19. Researchers searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, MEDLINE, Embase, the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease, and three other databases up to 18 July 2023 for RCTs evaluating the efficacy of favipiravir in treating people with COVID-19. Using standard Cochrane methodological procedures and the GRADE approach, they included 25 trials that randomized 5750 adults (most under 60 years of age) across multiple countries, with most participants hospitalized with mild to moderate disease (89%). Twenty-two trials compared favipiravir to placebo or standard of care, two used lopinavir/ritonavir, and one used umifenovir; most regimens began with 1600 mg or 1800 mg twice daily on day one, followed by 600 mg to 800 mg twice daily for five to 14 days. The evidence remains very uncertain regarding whether favipiravir reduces all-cause mortality at 28 to 30 days or in-hospital (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.46; 11 trials, 3459 participants), or whether it reduces progression to invasive mechanical ventilation (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.09; 8 trials, 1383 participants). Favipiravir may make little to no difference in the need for hospital admission among ambulatory patients (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.46; 4 trials, 670 participants), and the evidence is very uncertain regarding time to clinical improvement (HR 1.13, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.83; 4 trials, 721 participants). It may also make little to no difference in progression to oxygen therapy (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.75; 2 trials, 543 participants). Favipiravir may lead to an increased incidence of adverse events overall (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.54; 18 trials, 4699 participants), but may result in little to no difference in serious adverse events attributable to the drug (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.42; 12 trials, 3317 participants). Overall, low- to very low-certainty evidence means that it is not known whether favipiravir is efficacious in people with COVID-19 illness of any severity or admission status, and while treatment may increase general adverse events, it may not increase serious adverse events.","What is favipiravir? Favipiravir is a medicine that can fight viruses. It is usually taken by mouth. Originally used for treating other viral infections, favipiravir has been suggested as a potential treatment for COVID-19 as it prevents the reproduction of the virus. Medical regulators have approved favipiravir for emergency use to treat people with COVID-19. What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out if favipiravir was better than no treatment, supportive treatment, or any other experimental antiviral treatment for people with COVID-19, in terms of death, need for a breathing machine (mechanical ventilation), and other outcomes. We also wanted to find out if favipiravir was associated with any unwanted effects. What did we do? We searched for studies that compared favipiravir with no treatment, supportive treatment, or other antiviral treatment in people with COVID-19 disease. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. What did we find? We found 25 relevant studies involving 5750 people. The studies were conducted in 13 different countries: Bahrain, Brazil, China, India, Iran, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, the UK, and the USA. Most people were under 60 years old and had mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms. What are the main results of our review?  We do not know if favipiravir reduces the number of people who die from COVID-19 when compared to dummy treatment, standard of care, or other antiviral medicines. The evidence supporting this is not very strong (derived from 11 studies involving 3459 people). It is also very unclear if favipiravir reduces the need for people to be put on ventilators compared to a dummy treatment or any other antiviral treatments (derived from 8 studies involving 1383 people). In people with mild symptoms, using favipiravir may not reduce the likelihood of needing hospitalization, but more research is needed to be sure (derived from 4 studies involving 670 people). Favipiravir has an unclear effect on the time it takes for people to improve, as defined by a reduction in their illness severity (derived from 4 studies involving 721 people).  Favipiravir seems to make very little difference in reducing the need for treatment with oxygen, compared to a dummy treatment or other antiviral treatment (derived from 2 studies involving 543 people). Favipiravir might lead to mild side effects (derived from 18 studies involving 4699 people) but doesn't seem to cause major or severe side effects (derived from 12 studies involving 3317 people). What are the limitations of the evidence? Our confidence in the evidence for using favipiravir is limited because people in the studies had different disease severities and the studies were of varying sizes and had inconsistent results.",1107,COVID-19 pandemic; SARS-CoV-2; favipiravir; all-cause mortality; invasive mechanical ventilation; ambulatory patients; oxygen therapy; adverse events; serious adverse events; lopinavir/ritonavir,"In evaluating the study outcomes, how should the inconsistent results influence future clinical guidelines regarding favipiravir?",Which methodological approaches from this review could be enhanced to better support favipiravir efficacy conclusions in future studies?,Select all of the following that are fruits,"Based on the plain-language summary, how could the clarity of favipiravir's effects on mechanical ventilation be improved?",Which outcome did the research hope to clarify regarding favipiravir's effect?,Inconsistent results suggest caution in widespread use without further research.; Inconsistencies indicate immediate adoption into treatment protocols.; They show consistent efficacy across all outcomes.,Inconsistent results suggest caution in widespread use without further research.,Only include studies with the most positive outcomes.; Increase uniformity in disease severity among participants.; Focus exclusively on small-scale trials to ensure manageability.,Increase uniformity in disease severity among participants.,dog; blue; grape,grape,By increasing the number of studies focusing on severe cases.; By completely excluding severe cases from trials.; By reducing the number of studies included in the analysis.,By increasing the number of studies focusing on severe cases.,Need for mechanical ventilation; Cure for COVID-19; Prevention of new infections,Need for mechanical ventilation
663ae3f35b81791c40865be5,interactive_3,D-dimer for excluding pulmonary embolism in hospital outpatient and accident and emergency populations,"Pulmonary embolism (PE) occurs when a blood clot travels through the bloodstream and becomes lodged in the arteries of the lungs, blocking blood flow. People are more likely to develop PE if they have cancer, have recently undergone surgery, have been immobile for long periods, or are pregnant. Symptoms can vary but often include sudden shortness of breath, chest pain, and rapid breathing. Because these symptoms are common and can be caused by many conditions, accurate and efficient testing is important. D-dimers are small protein fragments released into the blood when the body breaks down a blood clot. The D-dimer test is widely used because it is quick, simple, inexpensive, and helps rule out venous thromboembolism (VTE), including PE. A normal D-dimer level makes the presence of a new blood clot very unlikely, helping avoid the need for more expensive or invasive imaging tests. This review assessed how well the D-dimer test can rule out acute PE in adults seen in outpatient clinics or emergency departments. All patients in the included studies had their pre-test probability (PTP) of PE determined using a clinical prediction rule (CPR), and none were already taking anticoagulants. The review included cross-sectional studies that compared D-dimer testing with established imaging standards such as ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scans, CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA), selective pulmonary angiography, or magnetic resonance pulmonary angiography (MRPA). D-dimer methods included quantitative, semi-quantitative, and qualitative assays. Four studies involving 1585 participants met the inclusion criteria. None were judged to be at high risk of bias, although some methodological details were unclear. Across all studies, D-dimer tests showed consistently high sensitivity meaning they correctly identified most people with PE with sensitivity ranging from 80% to 100%. However, specificity was low (23% to 63%), resulting in many false-positive results, especially among adults over 65 years old. This means that while a normal D-dimer level strongly suggests the absence of PE, an elevated D-dimer level is common and not specific to PE, often prompting further testing. Overall, the evidence shows that a negative D-dimer result is a reliable way to rule out PE in patients who have a low pre-test probability. One study suggested that the test may be less helpful in older adults because D-dimer levels tend to rise naturally with age, but there is currently no direct evidence supporting the use of higher diagnostic thresholds for people over 65. More research is needed to determine whether age-adjusted thresholds improve accuracy without increasing risk.","To investigate the ability of the D-dimer test to rule out a diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients treated in hospital outpatient and accident and emergency (A&E) departments.
Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a serious, potentially fatal condition that occurs when a blood clot becomes lodged in the blood vessels of the lungs. When people arrive to hospital A&E departments reporting difficulty breathing, breathlessness and chest pain, several explanations are possible but a quick diagnosis is needed. Tests that are available to detect blood clots in the lungs can be invasive and time-consuming, can carry a radiation burden and may be costly. Quick, easy-to-use and inexpensive tests that can be used to rule out the diagnosis would be very valuable.
One such test is the D-dimer test, which is so named because it detects small pieces of protein in the blood, which are called D-dimer. When someone with symptoms of breathlessness and chest pain arrives to the hospital A&E department, the staff conducts an examination and asks questions about the patient's medical history and lifestyle. This helps them to calculate a score for the patient's risk that symptoms are due to a PE.
If the score shows that they are at high risk of a blood clot in the lungs, patients undergo diagnostic scanning immediately (or are treated while test results are awaited). A D-dimer test can be ordered for people in low or moderate (or unlikely) risk groups; a negative D-dimer result might rule out the diagnosis of PE without the need for imaging.
This review considered all evidence provided by studies that assess the ability of D-dimer to rule out PE in people attending hospital outpatient and A&E departments.
We assessed all available reports from a wide search of databases of medical literature. Two review authors independently assessed studies that met the review criteria, including use of a study design called a cross-sectional study; inclusion of people with symptoms of PE who attended hospital outpatient and A&E departments; use of a risk score and then a D-dimer test; and comparison of results of the D-dimer test against the results of the very best available tests - ventilation/perfusion scanning (V/Q scanning), pulmonary angiography, computerised tomography pulmonary angiography, and magnetic resonance pulmonary angiography.
The flow of patients and the timing of D-dimer and reference standard tests were of greatest methodological concern; no study authors provided a flow diagram to show the flow of patients throughout their study, and only one study clearly reported the time between administration of index and reference standard tests. In the remaining three studies, timing between conduct of the index test and completion of the reference standard was not clearly reported, leading to an unclear classification of bias.
Limited evidence from the studies included in this review suggests that quantitative D-dimer tests used in emergency departments have few false-negatives but very high levels of false-positive results, with a high level of sensitivity consistently evident across all age groups. This makes the test useful as a rule-out test but means that a positive result requires diagnostic imaging.",1051,Pulmonary embolism; D-dimer; pre-test probability; ventilation/perfusion scans; CT pulmonary angiography; selective pulmonary angiography; magnetic resonance pulmonary angiography; sensitivity; specificity,How do the motivations for conducting the D-dimer test studies reflect the challenges faced in diagnosing pulmonary embolism in emergency settings?,How can the high sensitivity but low specificity of the D-dimer test be organized into a diagnostic approach for ruling out PE?,Select all of the following that are colors,How is sensitivity of the D-dimer test described across different age groups?,What is the primary reason for conducting further diagnostic imaging after a positive D-dimer test result?,The studies aim to reduce the need for invasive and costly tests in emergency settings.; The studies aim to establish a higher diagnostic threshold for older adults.; The studies aim to exclusively use quantitative methods for D-dimer testing.,The studies aim to reduce the need for invasive and costly tests in emergency settings.,"Use the D-dimer test to rule out PE in low-risk patients, followed by imaging for positive results.; Apply the D-dimer test only after imaging has been completed.; Ignore the D-dimer test results unless the patient is under 40 years of age.","Use the D-dimer test to rule out PE in low-risk patients, followed by imaging for positive results.",blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,High sensitivity across all age groups; Low sensitivity in young adults; Inconsistent sensitivity,High sensitivity across all age groups,The D-dimer test has high levels of false positives; To confirm the presence of cancer; To estimate lung capacity,The D-dimer test has high levels of false positives
663ae3f35b81791c40865be5,interactive_4,Does galantamine help people with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease and people with mild cognitive impairment?,"Dementia leads to progressive cognitive decline, and represents a significant health and societal burden. Its prevalence is growing, with Alzheimer's disease as the leading cause. There is no cure for Alzheimer's disease, but there are regulatory-approved pharmacological interventions, such as galantamine, for symptomatic relief.  To assess the clinical effects, including adverse effects, of galantamine in people with probable or possible Alzheimer's disease or mild cognitive impairment, and to investigate potential moderators of effect. We systematically searched the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialised Register on 14 December 2022 using the term 'galantamine'. The Register contains records of clinical trials identified from major electronic databases (including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase), trial registries, grey literature sources, and conference proceedings. We manually searched reference lists and collected information from US Food and Drug Administration documents and unpublished trial reports. We imposed no language restrictions. We included double-blind, parallel-group, randomised controlled trials comparing oral galantamine with placebo for a treatment duration exceeding four weeks in people with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease or with mild cognitive impairment. Working independently, two review authors selected studies for inclusion, assessed their quality, and extracted data. Outcomes of interest included cognitive function, change in global function, activities of daily living, functional disability, behavioural function, and adverse events. We used a fixed-effect model for meta-analytic synthesis, and presented results as Peto odds ratios (OR) or weighted mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals. We used Cochrane's original risk of bias tool (RoB 1) to assess the risk of bias in the included studies. We included 21 studies with a total of 10,990 participants. The average age of participants was 74 years, and 37% were male. The studies' durations ranged from eight weeks to two years, with 24 weeks being the most common duration. One newly included study assessed the effects of galantamine at two years, and another newly included study involved participants with severe Alzheimer's disease. Nineteen studies with 10,497 participants contributed data to the meta-analysis. All studies had low to unclear risk of bias for randomisation, allocation concealment, and blinding. We judged four studies to be at high risk of bias due to attrition and two due to selective outcome reporting. Galantamine for dementia due to Alzheimer's disease We summarise only the results for galantamine given at 8 to 12 mg twice daily (total galantamine 16 mg to 24 mg/day), assessed at six months. See the full review for results of other dosing regimens and assessment time points. There is high-certainty evidence that, compared to placebo, galantamine improves: cognitive function, as assessed with the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-cog) (MD-2.86, 95% CI -3.29 to -2.43; 6 studies, 3049 participants; minimum clinically important effect (MCID) = 2.6- to 4-point change); functional disability, as assessed with the Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD) scale (MD 2.12, 95% CI 0.75 to 3.49; 3 studies, 1275 participants); and behavioural function, as assessed with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) (MD -1.63, 95% CI -3.07 to -0.20; 2 studies, 1043 participants) at six months. Galantamine may improve global function at six months, as assessed with the Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change plus Caregiver Input (CIBIC-plus) (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.36 to 1.84; 6 studies, 3002 participants; low-certainty evidence). Participants who received galantamine were more likely than placebo-treated participants to discontinue prematurely (22.7% versus 17.2%) (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.68; 6 studies, 3336 participants; high-certainty evidence), and experience nausea (20.9% versus 8.4%) (OR 2.89, 95% CI 2.40 to 3.49; 7 studies, 3616 participants; high-certainty evidence) during the studies. Galantamine reduced death rates at six months: 1.3% of participants in the galantamine groups had died compared to 2.3% in the placebo groups (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.96; 6 studies, 3493 participants; high-certainty evidence). Galantamine for mild cognitive impairment We summarise results, assessed at two years, from two studies that gave participants galantamine at 8 to 12 mg twice daily (total galantamine 16 mg to 24 mg/day). Compared to placebo, galantamine may not improve cognitive function, as assessed with the expanded ADAS-cog for mild cognitive impairment (MD -0.21, 95% CI -0.78 to 0.37; 2 studies, 1901 participants; low-certainty evidence) or activities of daily living, assessed with the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living scale for mild cognitive impairment (MD 0.30, 95% CI -0.26 to 0.86; 2 studies, 1901 participants; low-certainty evidence). Participants who received galantamine were probably more likely to discontinue prematurely than placebo-treated participants (40.7% versus 28.6%) (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.42 to 2.05; 2 studies, 2057 participants) and to experience nausea (29.4% versus 10.7%) (OR 3.49, 95% CI 2.75 to 4.44; 2 studies, 2057 participants), both with moderate-certainty evidence. Galantamine may not reduce death rates at 24 months compared to placebo (0.5% versus 0.1%) (OR 5.03, 95% CI 0.87 to 29.10; 2 studies, 2057 participants; low-certainty evidence). Results from subgroup analysis and meta-regression suggest that an imbalance in discontinuation rates between galantamine and placebo groups, together with the use of the 'last observation carried forward' approach to outcome assessment, may potentially bias cognitive outcomes in favour of galantamine. Compared to placebo, galantamine (when given at a total dose of 16 mg to 24 mg/day) slows the decline in cognitive function, functional ability, and behaviour at six months in people with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. Galantamine probably also slows declines in global function at six months. The changes observed in cognition, assessed with the ADAS-cog scale, were clinically meaningful. Gastrointestinal-related adverse events are the primary concerns associated with galantamine use in people with dementia, which may limit its tolerability. Although death rates were generally low, participants in the galantamine groups had a reduced risk of death compared to those in the placebo groups. There is no evidence to support the use of galantamine in people with mild cognitive impairment.","Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia among older people that causes problems with memory, thinking, and behaviour. The disease worsens over time to the extent that it affects a person's ability to carry out day-to-day tasks. For people with mild cognitive impairment, symptoms affecting thinking and memory are mild and usually not serious enough to interfere with daily life and activities. Currently, there is no cure for Alzheimer's disease, but medications that can help with symptoms are available. Galantamine is one of the three cholinesterase inhibitor medications approved by the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Galantamine works by increasing the levels of a chemical in the brain, acetylcholine, that transmits signals, which may help with symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. There are no medications currently approved by regulatory bodies as treatments for mild cognitive impairment. We wanted to know whether galantamine is effective and helpful in improving the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment, in terms of memory, ability to carry out self-care, and behaviour. We also wanted to find out if galantamine causes any unwanted effects. We searched for studies that compared galantamine given by mouth to placebo (which does not contain any active ingredients but is given in the same way as the active medication) in people with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, or with mild cognitive impairment. We chose studies in which people were assigned randomly (like a flip of a coin) to receive galantamine or placebo for at least 4 weeks. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 21 studies that involved 10,990 people with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, or with mild cognitive impairment. Their average age was 74 years. Treatment durations ranged from 8 weeks to 2 years. Most studies included people with dementia due to mild or moderate Alzheimer's disease; one study involved people with severe Alzheimer's disease. Three studies included people with mild cognitive impairment. Pharmaceutical companies (Janssen / Johnson & Johnson) sponsored 16 of the 21 included studies. After 6 months of treatment, participants with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease who received galantamine had better memory, ability to do self-care activities, and behaviour than those who received placebo. Importantly, the memory improvements we observed were considered clinically meaningful according to standards set by experts. This same group of participants probably had better overall improvement than those who received placebo. In people with mild cognitive impairment, galantamine, compared to placebo, may make little to no difference in improving memory or the ability to do self-care activities. However, participants who received galantamine probably had a lower risk of progression to dementia after 2 years of treatment. Compared to those taking placebo, people on galantamine were three times more likely to experience gastrointestinal side effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea). The number of deaths was low, and there was no evidence that galantamine caused more deaths than placebo. Many people in the studies (ranging from 17% to 40%) stopped taking their assigned medication early, more so in the galantamine groups than the placebo groups. This is a limitation which may favour galantamine.",1126,Dementia; Alzheimer's disease; galantamine; symptomatic relief; cognitive function; adverse effects; mild cognitive impairment,What were the primary motivations for conducting this study on galantamine as mentioned in the summary?,"In evaluating the results of the study, what were the main findings regarding galantamine's effect on mild cognitive impairment?",Select all of the following that are fruits,What conclusions can be drawn about the clinical significance of memory improvements with galantamine in Alzheimer's patients?,What potential limitations in the study process might influence the perceived benefits of galantamine according to the summary?,To find a cure for Alzheimer's disease.; To assess galantamine's effectiveness on symptoms of Alzheimer's and mild cognitive impairment.; To determine the best dosage for preventing AlzheimerÃ¢ÂÂs disease.,To assess galantamine's effectiveness on symptoms of Alzheimer's and mild cognitive impairment.,Galantamine substantially improved memory and self-care ability.; Galantamine had little to no effect on memory and self-care abilities.; Galantamine completely prevented progression to more severe conditions.,Galantamine had little to no effect on memory and self-care abilities.,dog; blue; grape,grape,The memory improvements were minor and not clinically important.; Galantamine led to clinically meaningful improvements in memory.; Improvements were only observed in younger participants.,Galantamine led to clinically meaningful improvements in memory.,The high dropout rate among participants receiving galantamine.; The exclusion of younger patients from the studies.; Over-recruitment of participants from a single demographic.,The high dropout rate among participants receiving galantamine.
663ae3f35b81791c40865be5,interactive_4,Does treatment with GLP-1 receptor agonists prevent complications for people with chronic kidney disease and diabetes?,"Approximately 40% of people with diabetes develop kidney failure and experience an accelerated risk of cardiovascular complications. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are glucose-lowering agents that manage glucose and weight control.
We assessed the benefits and harms of GLP-1 receptor agonists in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes.
The Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies was searched to 10 September 2024 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.
Randomised controlled studies were eligible if participants with diabetes and CKD were randomly allocated to a GLP-1 receptor agonist, placebo, standard care or a second glucose-lowering agent. CKD included all stages (from 1 to 5).
Three authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias using the risk of bias assessment tool 2. Pooled analyses using summary estimates of effects were obtained using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and/or hazard ratio (HR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. The primary outcomes included death (all-cause and cardiovascular), 3- and 4-point major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), kidney failure, composite kidney outcome, and severe hypoglycaemia. The secondary outcomes included non-fatal or fatal myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke, non-fatal peripheral arterial events, heart failure, hospitalisation due to heart failure, estimated glomerular filtration rate or creatinine clearance, doubling of serum creatinine, urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio, albuminuria progression, vascular access outcomes, body weight, body mass index, fatigue, life participation, peritoneal dialysis infection, peritoneal dialysis failure, adverse events, serious adverse events, withdrawal due to adverse events, HbA1c, sudden death, acute MI, ischaemic stroke, and coronary revascularisation. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.
Forty-two studies involving 48,148 participants were included. All studies were conducted on people with type 2 diabetes, and no studies were carried out on children. The median study age was 66 years. The median study follow-up was 26 weeks. Six studies were conducted in people with CKD stages 1-2, 11 studies in people with CKD stages 3-5, one study in people on dialysis, and the remaining studies included people with both CKD stages 1-2 and 3-5. Risks of bias in the included studies for all the primary outcomes in studies that compared GLP-1 receptor agonists to placebo were low in most methodological domains, except one study that was assessed at high risk of bias due to missing outcome data for death (all-cause and cardiovascular). The overall risk of bias for all-cause and cardiovascular death in studies that reported the treatment effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists compared to standard care, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors or sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors were assessed as unclear or at high risk of bias due to deviations from intended interventions or missing data. For GLP-1 receptor agonists compared to insulin or another GLP-1 receptor agonist, the risk of bias for all-cause and cardiovascular death was low or unclear. Compared to placebo, GLP-1 receptor agonists probably reduced the risk of all-cause death (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.98; I²= 23%; 8 studies, 17,861 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), but may have little or no effect on cardiovascular death (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.05; I²= 42%; 7 studies, 17,801 participants; low-certainty evidence). Compared to placebo, GLP-1 receptor agonists probably decreased 3-point MACE (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.98; I² = 65%; 4 studies, 19,825 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and 4-point MACE compared to placebo (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.89; 1 study, 2,158 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Based on absolute risks of clinical outcomes, it is likely that GLP-1 receptor agonists prevent all-cause death in 52 people with CKD stages 1-2 and 116 in CKD stages 3-5, cardiovascular death in 34 people with CKD stages 1-2 and 71 in CKD stages 3-5, while 95 CKD stages 1-2 and 153 in CKD stages 3-5 might experience a major cardiovascular event for every 1000 people treated over 1 year. Compared to placebo, GLP-1 receptor agonists probably had little or no effect on kidney failure, defined as starting dialysis or kidney transplant (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.13; I²= 0%; 3 studies, 4,134 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), or on composite kidney outcomes (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.02; I²= 0%; 2 studies, 16,849 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Compared to placebo, GLP-1 receptor agonists may have little or no effect on the risk of severe hypoglycaemia (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.25; I² = 44%; 4 studies, 6,292 participants; low-certainty evidence). The effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists compared to standard care or other hypoglycaemic agents were uncertain. No studies evaluated treatment on risks of fatigue, life participation, amputation or fracture.
GLP-1 receptor agonists probably reduced all-cause death but may have little or no effect on cardiovascular death in people with CKD and diabetes. GLP-1 receptor agonists probably lower major cardiovascular events, probably have little or no effect on kidney failure and composite kidney outcomes, and may have little or no effect on the risk of severe hypoglycaemia in people with CKD and diabetes.","Chronic kidney disease (CKD) (a long-term condition where the kidneys do not work effectively) and diabetes (a lifelong condition that causes a person's blood sugar level to become too high) are chronic conditions that bring on many challenges for people, particularly when they have to manage both at the same time. Diabetes can accelerate the development of kidney disease and is the leading cause of kidney failure (a condition where the kidneys no longer function well enough to keep a person alive). GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1) are medicines that lower blood glucose levels and may also have beneficial effects on high blood pressure and obesity, and decrease the chances of death, heart attack, stroke and kidney failure (a condition where the kidneys no longer function well enough to keep a person alive).
We wanted to find out if GLP-1 improves diabetes control and kidney function, decreases heart-related complications such as heart attacks and stroke, and decreases the risk of kidney failure in people with both CKD and diabetes.
We searched for all trials that assessed the benefits and harms of GLP-1 for treating people with both CKD and diabetes. We compared GLP-1 with placebo (dummy medicine), usual care, and other glucose-lowering medicines (for example, insulin).
We included 42 studies that randomised 48,148 adults (18 years or older) with CKD and diabetes. None of the studies included children. The number of people ranged from 7 to 14,691, and the age ranged from 51 to 71 years. On average, the duration of the studies was six months. Twenty-one studies compared GLP-1 to placebo, 16 compared GLP-1 to a variety of glucose-lowering medicines, and five compared GLP-1 to standard care. Twenty-eight studies were multinational.
Compared to placebo, GLP-1 probably reduces the overall risk of dying due to any cause but may have little or no effect on the chances of dying from a heart-related problem. When major heart-related events were investigated together (death due to a heart attack, nonfatal heart attack and nonfatal stroke), GLP-1 probably reduces the risk of these combined events occurring. GLP-1 probably makes little or no difference to kidney failure and may make little or no difference to abnormally low blood glucose levels.
The effect of GLP-1 compared to usual care and other glucose-lowering medicines is unclear.
We are moderately confident that GLP-1 reduces the risk of dying due to any cause, reduces major heart-related events, and makes little or no difference to kidney failure. We are less confident in its effect on death from a heart-related problem or abnormally low blood sugar levels.

663ae3f35b81791c40865be5,finetuned_5,"Does cardiovascular training relieve cancer-related fatigue before, during, or after anticancer therapy?","To evaluate the effects of cardiovascular training on cancer-related fatigue (CRF), quality of life (QoL), adverse events, anxiety, and depression in people with cancer, with regard to their stage of anticancer therapy (before, during, or after), up to 12 weeks, up to six months, or longer, postintervention.
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov and World Health Organization ICTRP to identify studies that are included in the review. The latest search date was October 2023.
Moderate-certainty evidence shows that cardiovascular training by people with cancer during their anticancer therapy slightly reduces short-term CRF and results in little to no difference in short-term QoL. We do not know whether cardiovascular training increases or decreases medium-term CRF/QoL, and long-term CRF/QoL. There is very low-certainty evidence (due to heterogeneous definitions, reporting and measurement) evaluating whether the training increases or decreases adverse events. In people with cancer who perform cardiovascular training after anticancer therapy, we are uncertain about the effects on short-term CRF/QoL, long-term CRF/QoL, and adverse events. We identified a lack of evidence concerning cardiovascular training before anticancer therapy and on safety outcomes. The 36 ongoing and 12 completed, but unpublished, studies could help close this gap, and could contribute to improving the effect estimates and certainty.
This Cochrane review was funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research of Germany, grant number: FKZ 01KG2017.","What is cancer-related fatigue? Cancer-related fatigue is an extreme feeling of tiredness over a long period of time. It can be caused by cancer treatment or the cancer itself. It is the most common symptom among people with cancer. It cannot be relieved by rest, and it affects the body and mind. What is cardiovascular training? Cardiovascular training is any activity that uses the large muscle groups of the buttocks and thighs, and increases heart and breathing rate. Examples are walking, running, cycling, and swimming. Why is cardiovascular training possibly effective for cancer-related fatigue? Cancer-related fatigue is linked to the body's response to cytokines, which regulate how tissues and organs increase in size (called cell growth). Cancer or cancer therapy may produce proteins called pro-inflammatory cytokines, which cause or worsen inflammation (the body's response to an injury or illness). Cardiovascular training can help reduce inflammation. What did we want to find out? We wanted to know whether cardiovascular training reduces cancer-related fatigue compared to no training. We explored the effects at short (up to 12 weeks), medium (up to six months), and long term (longer than six months). We also looked at quality of life, unwanted effects, anxiety, and depression. What did we do? We searched for studies that investigated cardiovascular training before, during, or after anticancer therapy compared to no training. These studies needed to evaluate cancer-related fatigue or quality of life, or both. The cardiovascular training needed at least five exercise sessions and had to be provided face-to-face, either in person or by video. We excluded studies with fewer than 20 people per group or studies only available in short-summary form. What did we find? We found 23 studies with 2135 people, mostly women with breast cancer. Most studies were conducted in high-income countries. A total of 1101 people received cardiovascular training and 1034 received no training. We also found 36 ongoing studies and 12 completed but unpublished studies. Main results: There were no studies comparing cardiovascular training before anticancer therapy with no training. We included 10 studies of cardiovascular training during anticancer therapy but could use only eight in our analyses. For cardiovascular training after anticancer therapy versus no training, we found 13 studies but could use only nine. Cardiovascular training during anticancer therapy probably reduces short-term cancer-related fatigue slightly (6 studies, 593 people) and probably results in little to no difference in short-term quality of life (6 studies, 612 people). It is unclear whether cardiovascular training affects medium- or long-term fatigue, quality of life, or unwanted effects. For cardiovascular training after anticancer therapy, we do not know whether it increases or decreases short- or long-term fatigue, quality of life, or unwanted effects, and no data were available for medium-term effects. What are the limitations of the evidence? We are moderately confident in the evidence on short-term fatigue and quality of life during anticancer therapy. Our confidence in all other results is very low because the studies were fewer, smaller, or had design limitations such as lack of blinding. There was no evidence for cardiovascular training before anticancer therapy or for medium-term effects after therapy.",1015,cardiovascular training; cancer-related fatigue (CRF); quality of life (QoL); adverse events; anticancer therapy,How does the study differentiate the impact of cardiovascular training on cancer-related fatigue based on the timing of the training in relation to anticancer therapy?,What critical gaps in the research were identified regarding the effects of cardiovascular training on cancer-related fatigue and quality of life?,Select all of the following that are fruits,What is cancer-related fatigue?,"According to the summary, what effect does cardiovascular training during anticancer therapy have on short-term quality of life?","By comparing cardiovascular training outcomes before, during, and after anticancer therapy.; By evaluating different types of cardiovascular exercises separately.; By focusing only on the exercise intensity.","By comparing cardiovascular training outcomes before, during, and after anticancer therapy.",Lack of studies on training before anticancer therapy and unclear medium- and long-term effects.; Inadequate comparison between different cancer types.; Failure to include age as a significant variable.,Lack of studies on training before anticancer therapy and unclear medium- and long-term effects.,dog; blue; grape,grape,An extreme feeling of tiredness over a long period of time.; A short-lasting tiredness that can be relieved by rest.; A feeling of tiredness that only affects the mind.,An extreme feeling of tiredness over a long period of time.,It results in little to no difference.; It significantly improves quality of life.; It worsens quality of life.,It results in little to no difference.
663ae3f35b81791c40865be5,finetuned_6,Immunosuppressive treatment for adults with idiopathic membranous nephropathy,"Primary membranous nephropathy (PMN) is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults, and without treatment about one-third of patients experience spontaneous remission, one-third have persistent proteinuria, and one-third progress to end?stage kidney disease (ESKD) within 10 years. Immunosuppressive therapy is used to protect kidney function in patients who do not improve with supportive treatment or who present with severe nephrotic syndrome, but the relative safety and effectiveness of different treatments have been unclear. This updated review included 65 studies involving 3807 adults with PMN and found that, compared with placebo or no immunosuppression, immunosuppressive therapy probably reduces the risk of progressing to ESKD, increases the likelihood of complete or partial remission, and lowers the number of people whose serum creatinine doubles, though it probably makes little or no difference to mortality. However, immunosuppressive therapy may increase relapse after remission and may increase temporary or permanent treatment discontinuation due to adverse effects, while its effects on infection and malignancy remain uncertain. Oral alkylating agents with or without steroids may reduce the risk of ESKD and may increase remission rates but also may lead to more treatment?related adverse events, and their effects on relapse, creatinine progression, infection, and malignancy remain uncertain. Evidence for calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus or cyclosporine), with or without steroids, was very uncertain, including whether they affect remission, relapse, ESKD, or adverse events. When calcineurin inhibitors were compared to alkylating agents, they appeared similarly effective for achieving remission but may result in higher relapse rates, though the overall certainty of evidence was low to moderate. Other treatments such as azathioprine, mizoribine, adrenocorticotropic hormone, traditional Chinese medicines, and rituximab had insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions. Overall, immunosuppressive therapy appears more effective than non-immunosuppressive management for inducing remission and reducing progression to ESKD, but this must be weighed against higher risks of adverse effects, and the evidence base remains limited by small sample sizes, high risk of bias, and inadequate follow-up. Alkylating agents combined with corticosteroids show both short- and long-term benefits but also higher toxicity, calcineurin inhibitors show similar efficacy but uncertain long-term safety, and biologics such as rituximab require further large, high-quality trials to determine their role.","Primary membranous nephropathy (PMN) is an autoimmune disease, where the body's immune system attacks the kidneys. The term ""primary"" is used to describe membranous nephropathy that is not caused by another disease in the body. PMN is a leading cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults. Nephrotic syndrome is a condition, where the membrane of the kidney is damaged and becomes permeable for proteins. Primary membranous nephropathy is diagnosed through findings in a kidney biopsy and the presence of nephrotic syndrome. PMN is not harmful in about one-third of patients, who will have a spontaneous ""complete remission"", which means that the disease will resolve by itself. However, about another one third will experience spontaneous remission but will have some protein in the urine that continues with normal kidney function. These patients usually only require supportive treatments that do not interact with the immune system. Without treatment, about 15% to 50% of patients progress to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) within 10 years. In some patients, PMN can be severe or continues to get worse even after using 6 months of supportive treatments. In these patients, extra treatment that dampens the activity of the immune system may be used to reduce damage to the kidney. It is not clear which of these treatment(s) is the most helpful and what side effects can occur. Therefore, the duration and intensity of immunosuppressive treatment need to be balanced against possible side effects. There are different classes of drugs used in immunosuppressive therapy. These drugs may or may not be combined with corticosteroids (drugs based on the body's stress response hormone cortisol). We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant specialised register up to 1 April 2021. We have combined studies to compare different treatment regimens with immunosuppressive therapy to assess which treatments help to treat patients with PMN and nephrotic syndrome with the least side effects. This review identified sixty-five studies with 3807 patients. Different types of immunosuppressive treatment include alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil), calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus and cyclosporine), antimetabolites (mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine), biologicals (e.g. rituximab) and adrenocorticotropic hormone. These drugs may or may not be combined with corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone), which also suppresses the immune system. After combining the results of available studies together, we found that compared with no treatment, supportive treatment or steroids alone, the use of immunosuppressive treatment probably reduced the number of patients who progressed to ESKD by about 40% and increased the number of patients that achieved complete remission. However, immunosuppressive treatment may lead to more adverse events, which can cause treatment to be stopped or lead to the patients needing to go to hospital. The different drugs that can be used in the immunosuppressive treatment were also examined in our review. We found that alkylating agents probably increases complete remission but may lead to more adverse events. We are uncertain whether alkylating agents increase infection or cancer. Based on the currently available evidence, the effectiveness of using calcineurin inhibitors is still unclear, but there is low certainty of the evidence, that CNI may lead to similar remission rates compared to alkylating agents.
Furthermore, other treatment options such as mycophenolate mofetil, adrenocorticotropic hormone, rituximab and others have only been examined in a few studies. There is not enough data to draw final conclusions on the use of these treatments in adults with PMN and nephrotic syndrome. The treatment of patients with PMN and nephrotic syndrome with immunosuppressive therapy compared to no treatment or supportive therapy alone probably protects the kidney but may increase side effects. A combination of immunosuppressive therapy with steroids may decrease disease activity and the use of alkylating agent combined with steroids probably has the short-term and long-term benefits of limiting damage to the kidney. Other therapies such as calcineurin inhibitors, mycophenolate mofetil, rituximab and adrenocorticotropic hormone have less certainty regarding their safety and effectiveness from these studies.",1086,Primary membranous nephropathy; nephrotic syndrome; immunosuppressive therapy; end-stage kidney disease; proteinuria; spontaneous remission; serum creatinine; alkylating agents; calcineurin inhibitors; rituximab,What is primary membranous nephropathy (PMN) primarily characterized by?,"In the context of PMN, what does spontaneous remission imply?",Select all of the following that are fruits,Which type of PMN patients might require immunosuppressive therapy?,What is a primary goal of immunosuppressive therapy in PMN treatment?,An autoimmune attack on the kidneys; A viral infection affecting the kidneys; A genetic disorder affecting the kidneys,An autoimmune attack on the kidneys,The disease resolves by itself; Immediate need for immunosuppressive therapy; Progression to end-stage kidney disease,The disease resolves by itself,dog; blue; grape,grape,Patients with spontaneous complete remission; Patients with severe or worsening PMN; All patients with nephrotic syndrome,Patients with severe or worsening PMN,To reduce the progression to end-stage kidney disease; To increase proteinuria; To eliminate the need for biopsy,To reduce the progression to end-stage kidney disease
663ae3f35b81791c40865be5,finetuned_6,Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation for adults after heart valve surgery,"The impact of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) following heart valve surgery is uncertain. We conducted an update of this systematic review and a meta-analysis to assess randomised controlled trial evidence for the use of exercise-based CR following heart valve surgery. To assess the benefits and harms of exercise-based CR compared with no exercise training in adults following heart valve surgery or repair, including both percutaneous and surgical procedures, we considered CR programmes consisting of exercise training with or without another intervention (such as an intervention with a psycho-educational component). We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials (CENTRAL), in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE (Ovid); Embase (Ovid); the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; EBSCO); PsycINFO (Ovid); Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS; Bireme); and Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science (CPCI-S) on the Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics) on 10 January 2020. We searched for ongoing trials from ClinicalTrials.gov, Clinical-trials.com, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform on 15 May 2020. We included randomised controlled trials that compared exercise-based CR interventions with no exercise training. Trial participants comprised adults aged 18 years or older who had undergone heart valve surgery for heart valve disease (from any cause) and had received heart valve replacement or heart valve repair. Both percutaneous and surgical procedures were included. Two review authors independently extracted data. We assessed the risk of systematic errors ('bias') by evaluating risk domains using the 'Risk of bias' (RoB2) tool. We assessed clinical and statistical heterogeneity. We performed meta-analyses using both fixed-effect and random-effects models. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence for primary outcomes (all-cause mortality, all-cause hospitalisation, and health-related quality of life). We included six trials with a total of 364 participants who have had open or percutaneous heart valve surgery. For this updated review, we identified four additional trials (216 participants). One trial had an overall low risk of bias, and we classified the remaining five trials as having some concerns. Follow-up ranged across included trials from 3 to 24 months. Based on data at longest follow-up, a total of nine participants died: 4 CR versus 5 control (relative risk (RR) 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 2.68; 2 trials, 131 participants; GRADE quality of evidence very low). No trials reported on cardiovascular mortality. One trial reported one cardiac-related hospitalisation in the CR group and none in the control group (RR 2.72, 95% CI 0.11 to 65.56; 1 trial, 122 participants; GRADE quality of evidence very low). We are uncertain about health-related quality of life at completion of the intervention in CR compared to control (Short Form (SF)-12/36 mental component: mean difference (MD) 1.28, 95% CI -1.60 to 4.16; 2 trials, 150 participants; GRADE quality of evidence very low; and SF-12/36 physical component: MD 2.99, 95% CI -5.24 to 11.21; 2 trials, 150 participants; GRADE quality of evidence very low), or at longest follow-up (SF-12/36 mental component: MD -1.45, 95% CI -4.70 to 1.80; 2 trials, 139 participants; GRADE quality of evidence very low; and SF-12/36 physical component: MD -0.87, 95% CI -3.57 to 1.83; 2 trials, 139 participants; GRADE quality of evidence very low). Due to lack of evidence and the very low quality of available evidence, this updated review is uncertain about the impact of exercise-CR in this population in terms of mortality, hospitalisation, and health-related quality of life. High-quality (low risk of bias) evidence on the impact of CR is needed to inform clinical guidelines and routine practice.","Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) that includes exercise training has been recommended as treatment for people after heart valve surgery. However, the strength of this evidence is uncertain. This updated review aimed to assess the benefits and harms of exercise-based CR for adults who have undergone heart valve surgery or repair.

We searched for studies examining the effects of exercise-based CR compared with no exercise ('control') after heart valve surgery for adults (18 years or older) with heart valve disease (from any cause).

5e27868c5cbbcc0b3599574b,static_1,Exercise-based rehabilitation for coronary heart disease,"Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the most common cause of death globally. However, with falling CHD mortality rates, an increasing number of people living with CHD may need support to manage their symptoms and prognosis. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) aims to improve the health and outcomes of people with CHD. This is an update of a Cochrane Review previously published in 2016. To assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of exercise-based CR (exercise training alone or in combination with psychosocial or educational interventions) compared with 'no exercise' control, on mortality, morbidity and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in people with CHD. We updated searches from the previous Cochrane Review, by searching CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two other databases in September 2020. We also searched two clinical trials registers in June 2021. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of exercise-based interventions with at least six months follow-up, compared with 'no exercise' control. The study population comprised adult men and women who have had a myocardial infarction (MI), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), or have angina pectoris, or coronary artery disease. We screened all identified references, extracted data and assessed risk of bias according to Cochrane methods. We stratified meta-analysis by duration of follow-up: short-term (6 to 12 months); medium-term (> 12 to 36 months); and long-term (> 3 years), and used meta-regression to explore potential treatment effect modifiers. We used GRADE for primary outcomes at 6 to 12 months (the most common follow-up time point). This review included 85 trials which randomised 23,430 people with CHD. This latest update identified 22 new trials (7795 participants). The population included predominantly post-MI and post-revascularisation patients, with a mean age ranging from 47 to 77 years. In the last decade, the median percentage of women with CHD has increased from 11% to 17%, but females still account for a similarly small percentage of participants recruited overall (< 15%). Twenty-one of the included trials were performed in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Overall trial reporting was poor, although there was evidence of an improvement in quality over the last decade. The median longest follow-up time was 12 months (range 6 months to 19 years). At short-term follow-up (6 to 12 months), exercise-based CR likely results in a slight reduction in all-cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 1.04; 25 trials; moderate certainty evidence), a large reduction in MI (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.93; 22 trials; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 75, 95% CI 47 to 298; high certainty evidence), and a large reduction in all-cause hospitalisation (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.77; 14 trials; NNTB 12, 95% CI 9 to 21; moderate certainty evidence). Exercise-based CR likely results in little to no difference in risk of cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.14; 15 trials; moderate certainty evidence), CABG (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.27; 20 trials; high certainty evidence), and PCI (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.19; 13 trials; moderate certainty evidence) up to 12 months' follow-up. We are uncertain about the effects of exercise-based CR on cardiovascular hospitalisation, with a wide confidence interval including considerable benefit as well as harm (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.59; low certainty evidence). There was evidence of substantial heterogeneity across trials for cardiovascular hospitalisations ( I²= 53%), and of small study bias for all-cause hospitalisation, but not for all other outcomes. At medium-term follow-up, although there may be little to no difference in all-cause mortality (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.02; 15 trials), MI (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.27; 12 trials), PCI (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.35; 6 trials), CABG (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.23; 9 trials), and all-cause hospitalisation (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.03; 9 trials), a large reduction in cardiovascular mortality was found (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.93; 5 trials). Evidence is uncertain for difference in risk of cardiovascular hospitalisation (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.12; 3 trials). At long-term follow-up, although there may be little to no difference in all-cause mortality (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.10), exercise-based CR may result in a large reduction in cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.78; 8 trials) and MI (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.90; 10 trials). Evidence is uncertain for CABG (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.27; 4 trials), and PCI (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.20; 3 trials). Meta-regression showed benefits in outcomes were independent of CHD case mix, type of CR, exercise dose, follow-up length, publication year, CR setting, study location, sample size or risk of bias. There was evidence that exercise-based CR may slightly increase HRQoL across several subscales (SF-36 mental component, physical functioning, physical performance, general health, vitality, social functioning and mental health scores) up to 12 months' follow-up; however, these may not be clinically important differences. The eight trial-based economic evaluation studies showed exercise-based CR to be a potentially cost-effective use of resources in terms of gain in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). This updated Cochrane Review supports the conclusions of the previous version, that exercise-based CR provides important benefits to people with CHD, including reduced risk of MI, a likely small reduction in all-cause mortality, and a large reduction in all-cause hospitalisation, along with associated healthcare costs, and improved HRQoL up to 12 months' follow-up. Over longer-term follow-up, benefits may include reductions in cardiovascular mortality and MI. In the last decade, trials were more likely to include females, and be undertaken in LMICs, increasing the generalisability of findings. Well-designed, adequately-reported RCTs of CR in people with CHD more representative of usual clinical practice are still needed. Trials should explicitly report clinical outcomes, including mortality and hospital admissions, and include validated HRQoL outcome measures, especially over longer-term follow-up, and assess costs and cost-effectiveness.","Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the single most common cause of death globally. However, with falling CHD mortality rates, an increasing number of people live with CHD and may need support to manage their symptoms (such as angina, shortness of breath with physical activity, and fatigue) and reduce the chances of future problems, such as heart attacks. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (exercise training alone or in combination with psychological or educational interventions) aims to improve the health and outcomes of people with CHD. We searched the scientific literature for randomised controlled trials (experiments that randomly allocate participants to one of two or more treatment groups) looking at the effectiveness of exercise-based treatments compared with no exercise in people of all ages with CHD. The evidence is current to September 2020. This latest update identified an additional 22 trials (7795 participants). We included a total of 85 trials that studied 23,430 people with CHD, predominantly heart attack survivors and those who had undergone heart bypass surgery or angioplasty (a procedure which widens narrowed or obstructed arteries or veins). Thirty-eight (45%) of the trials involved exercise-only interventions and 47 (55%) involved interventions with exercise plus other components. The type of exercise most often included was stationary cycling, walking or circuit training. Twenty-one (25%) of the interventions were delivered in the participants' homes. The findings of this update are consistent with the previous (2016) version of this Cochrane Review, and show important benefits of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation that include a reduction in the risk of death due to any cause, heart attack, and hospital admission, and improvements in health-related quality of life, compared with not undertaking exercise. A small body of economic evidence was identified, indicating exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation to be cost-effective. Many of the studies identified in this current update were undertaken in low- and middle-income countries, which increases the generalisability of our results to these settings where levels of CHD are high and continue to increase. Although the reporting of methods has improved in recent trials, lack of reporting key methodological aspects made it difficult to assess the overall methodological quality and risk of possible bias of the evidence.",1031,Coronary heart disease; cardiac rehabilitation; myocardial infarction; coronary artery bypass graft; percutaneous coronary intervention; angina pectoris; health-related quality of life; quality-adjusted life years; psychosocial interventions; revascularisation,How do the latest findings on exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation enhance the understanding of its benefits for people with CHD?,What is the primary aim of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) in people with CHD?,Select the items that are animals,How does exercise-based CR affect the risk of hospital admission for those with CHD?,What type of exercise is most commonly included in exercise-based CR?,They demonstrate a reduction in cardiovascular mortality over long-term follow-up.; They highlight the lack of effectiveness in reducing hospital admissions.; They confirm improvements in health-related quality of life within 12 months.,They demonstrate a reduction in cardiovascular mortality over long-term follow-up.; They confirm improvements in health-related quality of life within 12 months.,To improve health and outcomes; To increase hospital admissions; To eliminate the need for medication,To improve health and outcomes,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,Reduces hospital admission risk; Increases hospital admission risk; Has no impact on hospital admission risk,Reduces hospital admission risk,Swimming; Stationary cycling; Weightlifting,Stationary cycling
5e27868c5cbbcc0b3599574b,static_2,Medicines to prevent breast cancer in women at above-average risk of developing breast cancer,"Breast cancer is the most frequently occurring malignancy and the second cause of death for cancer in women. Cancer prevention agents (CPAs) are a promising approach to reduce the burden of breast cancer. Currently, two main types of CPAs are available: selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs, such as tamoxifen and raloxifene) and aromatase inhibitors (AIs, such as exemestane and anastrozole).
To assess the efficacy and acceptability of single CPAs for the prevention of primary breast cancer, in unaffected women, at an above-average risk of developing breast cancer. Using a network meta-analysis, to rank single CPAs, based on their efficacy and acceptability (an endpoint that is defined as the inverse of CPA-related toxicity).
We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), and ClinicalTrials.gov on 17 August 2018. We handsearched reference lists to identify additional relevant studies.
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that enrolled women without a personal history of breast cancer but with an above-average risk of developing a tumor. Women had to be treated with a CPA and followed up to record the occurrence of breast cancer and adverse events.
Two review authors independently extracted data and conducted risk of bias assessments of the included studies, and assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. Outcome data included incidence of breast carcinoma (both invasive and in situ carcinoma) and adverse events (both overall and severe toxicity). We performed a conventional meta-analysis (for direct comparisons of a single CPA with placebo or a different CPA) and network meta-analysis (for indirect comparisons).
We included six studies enrolling 50,927 women randomized to receive one CPA (SERMs: tamoxifen or raloxifene, or AIs: exemestane or anastrozole) or placebo. Three studies compared tamoxifen and placebo, two studies compared AIs (exemestane or anastrozole) versus placebo, and one study compared tamoxifen versus raloxifene. The risk of bias was low for all RCTs. For the tamoxifen versus placebo comparison, tamoxifen likely resulted in a lower risk of developing breast cancer compared to placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 0.76; 3 studies, 22,832 women; moderate-certainty evidence). In terms of adverse events, tamoxifen likely increased the risk of severe toxicity compared to placebo (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.47; 2 studies, 20,361 women; moderate-certainty evidence). In particular, women randomized to receive tamoxifen experienced a higher incidence of both endometrial carcinoma (RR 2.26, 95% CI 1.52 to 3.38; high-certainty evidence) and thromboembolism (RR 2.10, 95% CI 1.14 to 3.89; high-certainty evidence) compared to women who received placebo. For the AIs versus placebo comparison, AIs (exemestane or anastrozole) reduced the risk of breast cancer by 53% (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.63; 2 studies, 8424 women; high-certainty evidence). In terms of adverse events, AIs increased the risk of severe toxicity by 18% (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.28; 2 studies, 8352 women; high-certainty evidence). These differences were sustained especially by endocrine (e.g. hot flashes), gastrointestinal (e.g. diarrhea), and musculoskeletal (e.g. arthralgia) adverse events, while there were no differences in endometrial cancer or thromboembolism rates between AIs and placebo. For the tamoxifen versus raloxifene comparison, raloxifene probably performed worse than tamoxifen in terms of breast cancer incidence reduction (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.43; 1 study, 19,490 women; moderate-certainty evidence), but its use was associated with lower toxicity rates (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.95; 1 study, 19,490 women; moderate-certainty evidence), particularly relating to incidence of endometrial cancer and thromboembolism. An indirect comparison of treatment effects allowed us to compare the SERMs and AIs in this review. In terms of efficacy, AIs (exemestane or anastrozole) may have reduced breast cancer incidence slightly compared to tamoxifen (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.98; 5 RCTs, 31,256 women); however, the certainty of evidence was low. A lack of model convergence did not allow us to analyze toxicity data.
For women with an above-average risk of developing breast cancer, CPAs can reduce the incidence of this disease. AIs appear to be more effective than SERMs (tamoxifen) in reducing the risk of developing breast cancer. AIs are not associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer and thromboembolic events. However, long-term data on toxicities from tamoxifen are available while the follow-up toxicity data on unaffected women taking AIs is relatively short. Additional data from direct comparisons are needed to fully address the issues of breast cancer prevention by risk-reducing medications, with special regards to acceptability (i.e. the benefit/harm ratio).","Breast cancer is the most frequent type of cancer and the second cause of death by cancer in women. Therefore, any strategy which can reduce its burden is eagerly awaited. Cancer prevention agents (CPAs) are medicines that might fulfil this need. Currently, two main types of CPAs are available to combat breast cancer: selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs, such as tamoxifen and raloxifene) and aromatase inhibitors (such as exemestane and anastrozole). Women without personal history of breast cancer, but with above-average risk of developing this disease (that is, with a lifetime risk greater than 17%) represent the usual target population for CPAs.
This Cochrane Review aimed to summarize the evidence on the efficacy and toxicity of CPAs for the prevention of primary breast cancer.
The review authors found six studies enrolling 50,927 women to receive one CPA or placebo (a pretend treatment, e.g. a sugar pill). Three studies involving 23,013 women compared tamoxifen and placebo, two studies involving 8424 women compared aromatase inhibitors (exemestane or anastrozole) and placebo, and one study involving 19,490 women that compared tamoxifen and raloxifene.
Based on the three studies that compared tamoxifen to placebo, tamoxifen probably reduced the risk of developing breast cancer by 32% compared to placebo. However, tamoxifen was associated with a 28% increased risk of severe side effects compared to placebo based on two studies involving 20,361 women. In particular, women taking tamoxifen experienced higher incidence of endometrial cancer and thromboembolism than women having no medicine.
For women who received either an aromatase inhibitor (exemestane or anastrozole) or placebo, aromatase inhibitors reduced the risk of breast cancer by 53% compared to placebo. Data from two studies involving 8352 women indicated that aromatase inhibitors increased the risk of severe side effects by 18% compared to placebo. These differences were sustained especially by endocrine (hormonal; e.g. hot flashes), gastrointestinal (e.g. diarrhea), and musculoskeletal (e.g. joint pain) side effects, whereas there were no differences in either endometrial cancer or thromboembolism rates.
For women who received either tamoxifen or raloxifene, raloxifene probably performed worse than tamoxifen in terms of breast cancer incidence reduction, but its use was associated with a 13% reduction of toxicity rates especially endometrial cancer and thromboembolism.
A specialized method named a 'network meta-analysis' allowed us to compare medications never directly compared to each other in a study. Based on this network meta-analysis, aromatase inhibitors may have led to a 23% additional risk reduction of developing breast cancer compared to tamoxifen. However, the reliability of the evidence was low meaning that further research is likely to have an impact on our confidence in this result.

Whether diet, physical activity or both can prevent or delay T2DM and its associated complications in at-risk people is unknown. To assess the effects of diet, physical activity or both on the prevention or delay of T2DM and its associated complications in people at increased risk of developing T2DM.
This is an update of the Cochrane Review published in 2008. We searched the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP Search Portal and reference lists of systematic reviews, articles and health technology assessment reports. The date of the last search of all databases was January 2017. We continuously used a MEDLINE email alert service to identify newly published studies using the same search strategy as described for MEDLINE up to September 2017. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a duration of two years or more. We used standard Cochrane methodology for data collection and analysis. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence using GRADE. We included 12 RCTs randomising 5238 people. One trial contributed 41% of all participants. The duration of the interventions varied from two to six years. We judged none of the included trials at low risk of bias for all 'Risk of bias' domains. Eleven trials compared diet plus physical activity with standard or no treatment. Nine RCTs included participants with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), one RCT included participants with IGT, impaired fasting blood glucose (IFG) or both, and one RCT included people with fasting glucose levels between 5.3 to 6.9 mmol/L. A total of 12 deaths occurred in 2049 participants in the diet plus physical activity groups compared with 10 in 2050 participants in the comparator groups (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.50; 95% prediction interval 0.44 to 2.88; 4099 participants, 10 trials; very low-quality evidence). The definition of T2DM incidence varied among the included trials. Altogether 315 of 2122 diet plus physical activity participants (14.8%) developed T2DM compared with 614 of 2389 comparator participants (25.7%) (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.64; 95% prediction interval 0.50 to 0.65; 4511 participants, 11 trials; moderate-quality evidence). Two trials reported serious adverse events. In one trial no adverse events occurred. In the other trial one of 51 diet plus physical activity participants compared with none of 51 comparator participants experienced a serious adverse event (low-quality evidence). Cardiovascular mortality was rarely reported (four of 1626 diet plus physical activity participants and four of 1637 comparator participants (the RR ranged between 0.94 and 3.16; 3263 participants, 7 trials; very low-quality evidence). Only one trial reported that no non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke had occurred (low-quality evidence). Two trials reported that none of the participants had experienced hypoglycaemia. One trial investigated health-related quality of life in 2144 participants and noted that a minimal important difference between intervention groups was not reached (very low-quality evidence). Three trials evaluated costs of the interventions in 2755 participants. The largest trial of these reported an analysis of costs from the health system perspective and society perspective reflecting USD 31,500 and USD 51,600 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) with diet plus physical activity, respectively (low-quality evidence). There were no data on blindness or end-stage renal disease. One trial compared a diet-only intervention with a physical-activity intervention or standard treatment. The participants had IGT. Three of 130 participants in the diet group compared with none of the 141 participants in the physical activity group died (very low-quality evidence). None of the participants died because of cardiovascular disease (very low-quality evidence). Altogether 57 of 130 diet participants (43.8%) compared with 58 of 141 physical activity participants (41.1%) group developed T2DM (very low-quality evidence). No adverse events were recorded (very low-quality evidence). There were no data on non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, blindness, end-stage renal disease, health-related quality of life or socioeconomic effects. Two trials compared physical activity with standard treatment in 397 participants. One trial included participants with IGT, the other trial included participants with IGT, IFG or both. One trial reported that none of the 141 physical activity participants compared with three of 133 control participants died. The other trial reported that three of 84 physical activity participants and one of 39 control participants died (very low-quality evidence). In one trial T2DM developed in 58 of 141 physical activity participants (41.1%) compared with 90 of 133 control participants (67.7%). In the other trial 10 of 84 physical activity participants (11.9%) compared with seven of 39 control participants (18%) developed T2DM (very low-quality evidence). Serious adverse events were rarely reported (one trial noted no events, one trial described events in three of 66 physical activity participants compared with one of 39 control participants - very low-quality evidence). Only one trial reported on cardiovascular mortality (none of 274 participants died - very low-quality evidence). Non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke were rarely observed in the one trial randomising 123 participants (very low-quality evidence). One trial reported that none of the participants in the trial experienced hypoglycaemia. One trial investigating health-related quality of life in 123 participants showed no substantial differences between intervention groups (very low-quality evidence). There were no data on blindness or socioeconomic effects. There is no firm evidence that diet alone or physical activity alone compared to standard treatment influences the risk of T2DM and especially its associated complications in people at increased risk of developing T2DM. However, diet plus physical activity reduces or delays the incidence of T2DM in people with IGT. Data are lacking for the effect of diet plus physical activity for people with intermediate hyperglycaemia defined by other glycaemic variables. Most RCTs did not investigate patient-important outcomes.","People with moderately elevated blood glucose (often referred to as 'prediabetes') are said to be at an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. It is currently recommended that all people with increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes should adjust their eating habits and physical activity levels. We wanted to find out whether these changes in diet, physical activity or both could prevent or delay type 2 diabetes in people at increased risk. We also wanted to know the effects on patient-important outcomes, such as complications of diabetes (e.g. kidney and eye disease, heart attack, stroke), death from any cause, health-related quality of life (a measure of a person's satisfaction with their life and health) and side-effects. Participants had to have blood glucose levels higher than considered normal, but below the glucose levels that are used to diagnose type 2 diabetes mellitus. We found 12 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) with 5238 participants. The duration of the treatments varied from two years to six years. Most trials included people defined as being at increased risk of type 2 diabetes based on glucose levels measured two hours after ingestion of 75 g of glucose (i.e. 'impaired glucose tolerance' (IGT) after an oral glucose tolerance test). This evidence is up to date as of January 2017. We used a MEDLINE email alert service to identify newly published studies up to September 2017. One study compared diet only with physical activity only. Fifty-seven of 130 participants (44%) in the diet-only group compared with 58 of 141 participants (41%) in the physical activity-only group developed type 2 diabetes. Two studies compared physical activity with standard treatment; in one study 58 of 141 participants (41%) in the physical activity group compared with 90 of 133 participants (68%) in the control group developed type 2 diabetes; in the other study 10 of 84 participants (12%) in the physical activity group compared with seven out of 39 participants (18%) in the control group developed type 2 diabetes. Eleven studies compared diet plus physical activity with standard or no treatment. Diet plus physical activity decreased the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, which occurred in 315 of 2122 participants (15%) in the diet plus physical activity group compared with 614 of 2389 participants (26%) in the standard treatment group. We detected neither an advantage nor a disadvantage of diet, physical activity or both with regard to heart attacks or strokes. Our included studies did not report on complications of diabetes such as kidney or eye disease. The effects on health-related quality of life were inconclusive. Very few participants died in the course of the studies and side-effects were also rare. Future long-term studies should investigate more patient-important outcomes like complications of diabetes, because we do not know for sure whether prediabetes is just a condition arbitrarily defined by a laboratory measurement or is, in fact, a real risk factor for type 2 diabetes mellitus and whether treatment of this condition translates into better patient-important outcomes. All included trials had deficiencies in the way that they were conducted or how key items were reported. For diet plus physical activity compared with standard treatment, we found rather good evidence that the development of new type 2 diabetes was reduced or delayed. For the other comparisons the number of participants was small, resulting in a high risk of random errors (play of chance).",1011,Type 2 diabetes mellitus; randomised controlled trials; impaired glucose tolerance; fasting blood glucose; serious adverse events; cardiovascular mortality; myocardial infarction; non-fatal stroke; hypoglycaemia; health-related quality of life,In what ways could the lack of reported diabetes complications data affect the interpretation of study results?,What was the primary objective of the study?,Select all of the following that are fruits,Describe the effect of diet plus physical activity on developing type 2 diabetes compared with standard treatment.,Identify the outcomes that were not conclusively affected by the interventions.,It may limit understanding of the full benefits of interventions.; It confirms the absence of any complications from diabetes.; It enhances the credibility of the studies by focusing only on T2DM incidence.,It may limit understanding of the full benefits of interventions.,Investigate whether diet and physical activity prevent type 2 diabetes.; Compare different types of medications for type 2 diabetes.; Evaluate the prevalence of type 2 diabetes worldwide.,Investigate whether diet and physical activity prevent type 2 diabetes.,dog; blue; grape,grape,It decreased the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.; It increased the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.; It had no effect on the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.,It decreased the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.,Health-related quality of life.; Blood glucose levels.; Body mass index.,Health-related quality of life.
5e27868c5cbbcc0b3599574b,interactive_3,L-ornithine L-aspartate for people with chronic liver disease and hepatic encephalopathy (poor brain functioning),"Hepatic encephalopathy is a common complication of cirrhosis and has high associated morbidity and mortality. The condition is classified as overt if it is clinically apparent or minimal if only evident though psychometric testing. The exact pathogenesis of this syndrome is unknown although ammonia is thought to play a key role. L-ornithine L-aspartate has ammonia-lowering properties and may, therefore, benefit people with cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy.
To evaluate the beneficial and harmful effects of L-ornithine L-aspartate versus placebo, no intervention, or other active interventions in people with cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy.
We undertook electronic searches of The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS and Science Citation Index Expanded to December 2017 and manual searches of meetings and conference proceedings; checks of bibliographies; and corresponded with investigators and pharmaceutical companies.
We included randomised clinical trials, irrespective of publication status, language, or blinding. We included participants with cirrhosis who had minimal or overt hepatic encephalopathy or who were at risk for developing hepatic encephalopathy. We compared: L-ornithine L-aspartate versus placebo or no intervention; and L-ornithine L-aspartate versus other active agents such as non-absorbable disaccharides, antibiotics, probiotics, or branched-chain amino acids.
Two review authors, working independently, retrieved data from published reports and correspondence with investigators and pharmaceutical companies. The primary outcomes were mortality, hepatic encephalopathy, and serious adverse events. We undertook meta-analyses and presented the results as risk ratios (RR) and mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed bias control using the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group domains; we evaluated the risk of publication bias and other small trial effects in regression analyses; conducted subgroup and sensitivity analyses; and performed Trial Sequential Analyses. We determined the quality of the evidence using GRADE.
We identified 36 randomised clinical trials, involving at least 2377 registered participants, which fulfilled our inclusion criteria including 10 unpublished randomised clinical trials. However, we were only able to access outcome data from 29 trials involving 1891 participants. Five of the included trials assessed prevention, while 31 trials assessed treatment. Five trials were at low risk of bias in the overall assessment of mortality; one trial was at low risk of bias in the assessment of the remaining outcomes. L-ornithine L-aspartate had a beneficial effect on mortality compared with placebo or no intervention when including all trials (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.72; I2= 0%; 19 trials; 1489 participants; very low quality evidence), but not when the analysis was restricted to the trials at low risk of bias (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.06 to 3.58; 4 trials; 244 participants). It had a beneficial effect on hepatic encephalopathy compared with placebo or no intervention when including all trials (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.83; 22 trials; 1375 participants; I2= 62%; very low quality evidence), but not in the one trial at low risk of bias (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.07; 63 participants). The analysis of serious adverse events showed a potential benefit of L-ornithine L-aspartate when including all randomised clinical trials (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.90; 1 trial; 1489 participants; I2= 0%; very low quality evidence), but not in the one trial at low risk of bias for this outcome (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.15 to 4.65; 63 participants). The Trial Sequential Analyses of mortality, hepatic encephalopathy, and serious adverse events found insufficient evidence to support or refute beneficial effects. Subgroup analyses showed no difference in outcomes in the trials evaluating evaluating the prevention or treatment of either overt or minimal hepatic encephalopathy or trials evaluating oral versus intravenous administration We were unable to undertake a meta-analysis of the three trials involving 288 participants evaluating health-related quality of life. Overall, we found no difference between L-ornithine L-aspartate and placebo or no intervention in non-serious adverse events (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.77; 14 trials; 1076 participants; I2= 40%). In comparison with lactulose, L-ornithine L-aspartate had no effect on mortality (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.11 to 4.17; 4 trials; 175 participants; I2= 0%); hepatic encephalopathy (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.57); serious adverse events (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.22 to 2.11); or non-serious adverse events (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.18). In comparison with probiotics, L-ornithine L-aspartate had no effect on mortality (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.11 to 9.51); serious adverse events (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.23 to 4.88); or changes in blood ammonia concentrations from baseline (RR -2.30 95% CI -6.08 to 1.48), but it had a possible beneficial effect on hepatic encephalopathy (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.90). Finally, in comparison with rifaximin, L-ornithine L-aspartate had no effect on mortality (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.03; 2 trials; 105 participants); hepatic encephalopathy (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.96); serious adverse events (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.42), or non-serious adverse events (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.42).
The results of this review suggest a possible beneficial effect of L-ornithine L-aspartate on mortality, hepatic encephalopathy, and serious adverse events in comparisons with placebo or no-intervention, but, because the quality of the evidence is very low, we are very uncertain about these findings. There was very low quality evidence of a possible beneficial effect of L-ornithine L-aspartate on hepatic encephalopathy, when compared with probiotics, but no other benefits were demonstrated in comparison with other active agents. Additional access to data from completed, but unpublished trials, and new randomised placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trials are needed.","Cirrhosis is a chronic disorder of the liver. People with this condition commonly develop hepatic encephalopathy, a complication that results in poor brain functioning. Some people with cirrhosis develop obvious clinical features of disturbed brain functioning, such as difficulties with speech, balance and daily functioning; they are said to have overt hepatic encephalopathy; the changes may be short-lived, may recur, or may persist for long periods. Other people with cirrhosis may show no obvious clinical changes but some aspects of their brain function, such as attention and the ability to perform complex tasks are found to be impaired when tested; they are said to have minimal hepatic encephalopathy. The reason why people develop hepatic encephalopathy is complex, but the accumulation in the blood of toxins from the gut, particularly of a compound called ammonia, plays a key role. L-ornithine L-aspartate lowers blood ammonia levels and so may have beneficial effects in people with hepatic encephalopathy or help stop them developing it.
We investigated the use of L-ornithine L-aspartate given either by mouth (oral) or into a vein in an fluid drip (intravenous) for the prevention and treatment of hepatic encephalopathy by reviewing clinical trials in which people with cirrhosis were randomly allocated to treatment with L-ornithine L-aspartate, to an inactive dummy (called placebo), to no treatment, or to another medicine for this condition such as lactulose, probiotics and rifaximin. We included participants with cirrhosis who had overt or minimal hepatic encephalopathy or who were at risk for developing this complication.
December 2017.
Six of the 36 randomised clinical trials we included received no funding or any other support from pharmaceutical companies. Seventeen trials received financial support from pharmaceutical companies and a further three received L-ornithine L-aspartate or inactive placebo free of charge; there was no information on funding in the remaining 10 trials.
We included 33 randomised clinical trials comparing L-ornithine L-aspartate with inactive placebo or no intervention and six randomised clinical trials comparing L-ornithine L-aspartate with other anti-encephalopathy treatments; some trials included more than one comparison. Five of the included trials tested L-ornithine L-aspartate for the prevention of hepatic encephalopathy while 30 trials tested its use as treatment for people with acute, chronic, or minimal hepatic encephalopathy. The length of treatment varied from three to 35 days in the trials testing the intravenous preparation (average eight days) and from seven to 180 days in those testing the oral preparation (average 30 days).
The evidence we found was very weak, and so we are not confident that L-ornithine L-aspartate is of use for preventing or treating hepatic encephalopathy in people with cirrhosis. Many studies were unpublished and so had not been carefully vetted, and many of the published trials received support from the pharmaceutical industry which introduces an element of bias. Accordingly, more information is needed before the value of L-ornithine L-aspartate for preventing and treating hepatic encephalopathy can be determined.",1094,Hepatic encephalopathy; cirrhosis; L-ornithine L-aspartate; ammonia-lowering properties; serious adverse events; non-absorbable disaccharides; probiotics; branched-chain amino acids; health-related quality of life; lactulose,How might the studyÃ¢ÂÂs conclusion about the effect of L-ornithine L-aspartate on mortality be critiqued?,Evaluate the potential impact of publication bias on the studyÃ¢ÂÂs results regarding serious adverse events.,Select the items that are animals,How might the trial design be improved to ensure more reliable outcomes in future studies on L-ornithine L-aspartate for hepatic encephalopathy?,What could be deduced about the weight of evidence from trials that were funded by pharmaceutical companies compared to those that were not?,"The conclusion may be overstated due to the very low quality of evidence.; The sample size was too large, creating unnecessary complexity.; The variations in treatment duration could result in inconsistencies.",The conclusion may be overstated due to the very low quality of evidence.; The variations in treatment duration could result in inconsistencies.,Publication bias may have led to an underestimation of adverse events.; Publication bias likely had no effect on the analysis of adverse events.; Publication bias would primarily affect the reporting of positive outcomes.,Publication bias may have led to an underestimation of adverse events.; Publication bias would primarily affect the reporting of positive outcomes.,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,Incorporate a larger number of double-blind trials to reduce bias.; Limit studies to a single administration method to simplify results.; Ensure all funding sources are disclosed to reduce potential bias.,Incorporate a larger number of double-blind trials to reduce bias.; Ensure all funding sources are disclosed to reduce potential bias.,"There might be an increased likelihood of positive outcomes in funded trials.; Funded trials are likely to have fewer participants, affecting outcomes.; Results from funded trials need cautious interpretation due to potential bias.",There might be an increased likelihood of positive outcomes in funded trials.; Results from funded trials need cautious interpretation due to potential bias.
5e27868c5cbbcc0b3599574b,interactive_4,Bisphosphonates and denosumab for breast cancer,"Bone is the most common site of metastatic disease associated with breast cancer (BC). Bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, and novel targeted therapies such as denosumab inhibit other key bone metabolism pathways. We have studied these agents in both early breast cancer and advanced breast cancer settings. This is an update of the review originally published in 2002 and subsequently updated in 2005 and 2012.
To assess the effects of bisphosphonates and other bone agents in addition to anti-cancer treatment: (i) in women with early breast cancer (EBC); (ii) in women with advanced breast cancer without bone metastases (ABC); and (iii) in women with metastatic breast cancer and bone metastases (BCBM).
In this review update, we searched Cochrane Breast Cancer's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov on 19 September 2016.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing: (a) one treatment with a bisphosphonate/bone-acting agent with the same treatment without a bisphosphonate/bone-acting agent; (b) treatment with one bisphosphonate versus treatment with a different bisphosphonate; (c) treatment with a bisphosphonate versus another bone-acting agent of a different mechanism of action (e.g. denosumab); and (d) immediate treatment with a bisphosphonate/bone-acting agent versus delayed treatment of the same bisphosphonate/bone-acting agent.
Two review authors independently extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and quality of the evidence. The primary outcome measure was bone metastases for EBC and ABC, and a skeletal-related event (SRE) for BCBM. We derived risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and the meta-analyses used random-effects models. Secondary outcomes included overall survival and disease-free survival for EBC; we derived hazard ratios (HRs) for these time-to-event outcomes where possible. We collected toxicity and quality-of-life information. GRADE was used to assess the quality of evidence for the most important outcomes in each treatment setting.
We included 44 RCTs involving 37,302 women. In women with EBC, bisphosphonates were associated with a reduced risk of bone metastases compared to placebo/no bisphosphonate (RR 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75 to 0.99; P = 0.03, 11 studies; 15,005 women; moderate-quality evidence with no significant heterogeneity). Bisphosphonates provided an overall survival benefit with time-to-event data (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.99; P = 0.04; 9 studies; 13,949 women; high-quality evidence with evidence of heterogeneity). Subgroup analysis by menopausal status showed a survival benefit from bisphosphonates in postmenopausal women (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.90; P = 0.001; 4 studies; 6048 women; high-quality evidence with no evidence of heterogeneity) but no survival benefit for premenopausal women (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.22; P = 0.78; 2 studies; 3501 women; high-quality evidence with no heterogeneity). There was evidence of no effect of bisphosphonates on disease-free survival (HR 0.94, 95% 0.87 to 1.02; P = 0.13; 7 studies; 12,578 women; high-quality evidence with significant heterogeneity present) however subgroup analyses showed a disease-free survival benefit from bisphosphonates in postmenopausal women only (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.91; P < 0.001; 7 studies; 8314 women; high-quality evidence with no heterogeneity). Bisphosphonates did not significantly reduce the incidence of fractures when compared to placebo/no bisphosphonates (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.08, P = 0.13, 6 studies, 7602 women; moderate-quality evidence due to wide confidence intervals). We await mature overall survival and disease-free survival results for denosumab trials. In women with ABC without clinically evident bone metastases, there was no evidence of an effect of bisphosphonates on bone metastases (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.43; P = 0.86; 3 studies; 330 women; moderate-quality evidence with no heterogeneity) or overall survival (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.09; P = 0.28; 3 studies; 330 women; high-quality evidence with no heterogeneity) compared to placebo/no bisphosphonates however the confidence intervals were wide. One study reported a trend towards an extended period of time without a SRE with bisphosphonate compared to placebo (low-quality evidence). One study reported quality of life and there was no apparent difference in scores between bisphosphonate and placebo (moderate-quality evidence). In women with BCBM, bisphosphonates reduced the SRE risk by 14% (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.95; P = 0.003; 9 studies; 2810 women; high-quality evidence with evidence of heterogeneity) compared with placebo/no bisphosphonates. This benefit persisted when administering either intravenous or oral bisphosphonates versus placebo. Bisphosphonates delayed the median time to a SRE with a median ratio of 1.43 (95% CI 1.29 to 1.58; P < 0.00001; 9 studies; 2891 women; high-quality evidence with no heterogeneity) and reduced bone pain (in 6 out of 11 studies; moderate-quality evidence) compared to placebo/no bisphosphonate. Treatment with bisphosphonates did not appear to affect overall survival (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.11; P = 0.85; 7 studies; 1935 women; moderate-quality evidence with significant heterogeneity). Quality-of-life scores were slightly better with bisphosphonates than placebo at comparable time points (in three out of five studies; moderate-quality evidence) however scores decreased during the course of the studies. Denosumab reduced the risk of developing a SRE compared with bisphosphonates by 22% (RR 0.78, 0.72 to 0.85; P < 0.001; 3 studies, 2345 women). One study reported data on overall survival and observed no difference in survival between denosumab and bisphosphonate. Reported toxicities across all settings were generally mild. Osteonecrosis of the jaw was rare, occurring less than 0.5% in the adjuvant setting (high-quality evidence).
For women with EBC, bisphosphonates reduce the risk of bone metastases and provide an overall survival benefit compared to placebo or no bisphosphonates. There is preliminary evidence suggestive that bisphosphonates provide an overall survival and disease-free survival benefit in postmenopausal women only when compared to placebo or no bisphosphonate. This was not a planned subgroup for these early trials, and we await the completion of new large clinical trials assessing benefit for postmenopausal women. For women with BCBM, bisphosphonates reduce the risk of developing SREs, delay the median time to an SRE, and appear to reduce bone pain compared to placebo or no bisphosphonate.","Breast cancer may spread and recur in the bones. This may cause fractures, pain and high calcium in the bloodstream (known as complications).
Medicines for osteoporosis may prevent these complications and may help cure cancer by reducing cancer growth in the bone. These medicines are called 'bisphosphonates'. A newer type is called  denosumab. Bisphosphonates or denosumab are given in addition to other cancer treatment medications. These may be given along with chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, or radiotherapy.
The goal of bisphosphonates and denosumab differs based on the women's breast cancer status.
We asked three main questions:
1. For women with early breast cancer (EBC) , can bisphosphonates or denosumab reduce the risk of the cancer spreading to the bone? Will adding this medicine to anticancer treatments allow women to live longer (improve survival)?
2. For women with advanced breast cancer which does not appear to involve the bone (ABC) , can bisphosphonates reduce the risk of the cancer spreading to the bone and improve survival? Will bisphosphonates reduce complications and improve quality of life?
3. For women with metastatic breast cancer that has spread to the bone (BCBM), can bisphosphonates or denosumab reduce the risk of complication, and improve quality of life and survival?
We found 44 studies involving 37,302 participants. We included studies published by September 2016.
For women with EBC, we included 17 studies with 26,129 participants. The women's health was monitored for at least 12 months from the start of the study. Some studies monitored women for 10 years.
The studies tested different types of bisphosphonate drugs and denosumab, and different doses of these drugs. Some studies compared the drugs to no treatment. Some studies used oral medications. Other studies gave the medicine as an injection into a vein or under the skin.
Bisphosphonates probably lowered the risk of cancer spreading to the bone.
Bisphosphonates were found to improve survival, but the benefit in the whole group of women was small. Postmenopausal women had a benefit from bisphosphonates with improved survival and reduced risk of cancer returning. Premenopausal women did not have improved survival or reduced risk of the cancer returning. New studies that test bisphosphonates by the women's menopausal status are awaited.
We await the reporting of data on survival and other important outcomes from denosumab trials.
For women with ABC that had not spread to the bone, we included three studies enrolling 330 participants. All three studies compared oral bisphosphonates to no treatment.
Bisphosphonates did not reduce the risk of cancer spreading to the bone or improve survival. Very little information was available on complications and quality of life from only one study.
For women with BCBM, we included 24 studies enrolling 10,853 participants. Their health was monitored for at least 12 months. Some women were followed for 24 months. Most studies compared bisphosphonates to receiving no medication.
Bisphosphonates reduced complications (fractures and bone pain). Bisphosphonates did not appear to increase the length of time women survived. Quality of life scores were slightly better for women receiving bisphosphonates compared to similar women having no bisphosphonates.
Denosumab reduced the risk of complications compared to bisphosphonates in the three studies that collected these data. There was no benefit in survival from denosumab in the one study that collected data.
Side effects were uncommon and mild. There was a rare risk of damage to the jaw bone (osteonecrosis of the jaw).
Overall, most of the evidence was moderate to high-quality.

5e27868c5cbbcc0b3599574b,interactive_4,Donepezil for people with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia in older people. One approach to symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease is to enhance cholinergic neurotransmission in the brain by blocking the action of the enzyme responsible for the breakdown of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. This can be done by a group of drugs known as cholinesterase inhibitors. Donepezil is a cholinesterase inhibitor. This review is an updated version of a review first published in 1998. To assess the clinical efficacy and safety of donepezil in people with mild, moderate or severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease; to compare the efficacy and safety of different doses of donepezil; and to assess the effect of donepezil on healthcare resource use and costs. We searched Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvements Specialized Register, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and a number of other sources on 20 May 2017 to ensure that the search was as comprehensive and up-to-date as possible. In addition, we contacted members of the Donepezil Study Group and Eisai Inc. We included all double-blind, randomised controlled trials in which treatment with donepezil was administered to people with mild, moderate or severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease for 12 weeks or more and its effects compared with those of placebo in a parallel group of patients, or where two different doses of donepezil were compared. One reviewer (JSB) extracted data on cognitive function, activities of daily living, behavioural symptoms, global clinical state, quality of life, adverse events, deaths and healthcare resource costs. Where appropriate and possible, we estimated pooled treatment effects. We used GRADE methods to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome. Thirty studies involving 8257 participants met the inclusion criteria of the review, of which 28 studies reported results in sufficient detail for the meta-analyses. Most studies were of six months' duration or less. Only one small trial lasted 52 weeks. The studies tested mainly donepezil capsules at a dose of 5 mg/day or 10 mg/day. Two studies tested a slow-release oral formulation that delivered 23 mg/day. Participants in 21 studies had mild to moderate disease, in five studies moderate to severe, and in four severe disease. Seventeen studies were industry funded or sponsored, four studies were funded independently of industry and for nine studies there was no information on source of funding. Our main analysis compared the safety and efficacy of donepezil 10 mg/day with placebo at 24 to 26 weeks of treatment. Thirteen studies contributed data from 3396 participants to this analysis. Eleven of these studies were multicentre studies. Seven studies recruited patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease, two with moderate to severe, and four with severe Alzheimer's disease, with a mean age of about 75 years. Almost all evidence was of moderate quality, downgraded due to study limitations. After 26 weeks of treatment, donepezil compared with placebo was associated with better outcomes for cognitive function measured with the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-Cog, range 0 to 70) (mean difference (MD) -2.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.31 to -2.02, 1130 participants, 5 studies), the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score (MD 1.05, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.37, 1757 participants, 7 studies) and the Severe Impairment Battery (SIB, range 0 to 100) (MD 5.92, 95% CI 4.53 to 7.31, 1348 participants, 5 studies). Donepezil was also associated with better function measured with the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study activities of daily living score for severe Alzheimer's disease (ADCS-ADL-sev) (MD 1.03, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.85, 733 participants, 3 studies). A higher proportion of participants treated with donepezil experienced improvement on the clinician-rated global impression of change scale (odds ratio (OR) 1.92, 95% CI 1.54 to 2.39, 1674 participants, 6 studies). There was no difference between donepezil and placebo for behavioural symptoms measured by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) (MD -1.62, 95% CI -3.43 to 0.19, 1035 participants, 4 studies) or by the Behavioural Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease (BEHAVE-AD) scale (MD 0.4, 95% CI -1.28 to 2.08, 194 participants, 1 study). There was also no difference between donepezil and placebo for Quality of Life (QoL) (MD -2.79, 95% CI -8.15 to 2.56, 815 participants, 2 studies). Participants receiving donepezil were more likely to withdraw from the studies before the end of treatment (24% versus 20%, OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.50, 2846 participants, 12 studies) or to experience an adverse event during the studies (72% vs 65%, OR 1.59, 95% 1.31 to 1.95, 2500 participants, 10 studies). There was no evidence of a difference between donepezil and placebo for patient total healthcare resource utilisation. Three studies compared donepezil 10 mg/day to donepezil 5 mg/day over 26 weeks. The 5 mg dose was associated with slightly worse cognitive function on the ADAS-Cog, but not on the MMSE or SIB, with slightly better QoL and with fewer adverse events and withdrawals from treatment. Two studies compared donepezil 10 mg/day to donepezil 23 mg/day. There were no differences on efficacy outcomes, but fewer participants on 10 mg/day experienced adverse events or withdrew from treatment. There is moderate-quality evidence that people with mild, moderate or severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease treated for periods of 12 or 24 weeks with donepezil experience small benefits in cognitive function, activities of daily living and clinician-rated global clinical state. There is some evidence that use of donepezil is neither more nor less expensive compared with placebo when assessing total healthcare resource costs. Benefits on 23 mg/day were no greater than on 10 mg/day, and benefits on the 10 mg/day dose were marginally larger than on the 5 mg/day dose, but the rates of withdrawal and of adverse events before end of treatment were higher the higher the dose.","Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia. As the disease progresses, people lose the ability to remember, communicate, think clearly and perform the activities of daily living. Their behaviour may also change. In severe Alzheimer's disease people lose the ability to care for themselves. The most commonly used treatment for Alzheimer's disease are medicines known as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Donepezil is one of these medicines. It is taken as a pill once a day. In Alzheimer's disease, one of the changes in the brain is a reduced number of nerve cells called cholinergic neurones. These are nerve cells that signal to other cells using a chemical called acetylcholine. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as donepezil, work by preventing acetylcholine from being broken down. This may improve the symptoms of dementia. However, acetylcholine is also found elsewhere in the body and so drugs of this type may have unwanted effects. In this review we examined evidence about benefits and harms from studies that compared donepezil, taken for at least 12 weeks, to placebo (a dummy pill), or that compared different doses of donepezil. The studies had to be double-blind and randomised, that is, the decision whether people taking part got donepezil or placebo had to be made randomly and neither they nor the researchers should have known which treatment they were getting while the trial was going on. This was to make the comparison as unbiased, or fair, as possible. We searched for studies up to May 2017. We assessed the quality of all the studies we included. When it was sensible to do so, we analysed the results of studies together to get an overall result. In general, we thought that the quality of the evidence was moderate. The main factor reducing our confidence was concern that the results of some studies might have been biased by the way they were done. We cannot be sure that the results apply to treatment longer than six months. After six months of treatment, there are benefits of donepezil that are large enough to measure in studies. It is associated with side effects that are mainly mild, but that may cause people to stop treatment. Being able to stabilise cognitive performance or ability to maintain activities of daily living may be important clinically. In terms of total healthcare costs the use of donepezil appears cost neutral. However, there does not appear to be an effect on quality of life. More data are still required from longer-term clinical studies examining measures of disease progression or time to needing full time care.",1127,Alzheimer's disease; dementia; cholinergic neurotransmission; cholinesterase inhibitors; donepezil; acetylcholine,What motivations likely influenced the research focus on the efficacy and safety of donepezil in Alzheimer's treatment?,"In evaluating the effects of different doses of donepezil, what criteria were used to assess its impact?",Select all of the following that are colors,What are the potential limitations in interpreting the study's findings about donepezil's efficacy?,Judge the appropriateness of using donepezil as a treatment in patients with severe Alzheimer's disease based on study outcomes.,The prevalence of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors as a treatment for Alzheimer's.; Need to determine the cost-effectiveness of donepezil compared to other medications.; The potential for donepezil to replace all other Alzheimer's treatments.,The prevalence of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors as a treatment for Alzheimer's.; Need to determine the cost-effectiveness of donepezil compared to other medications.,Cognitive function improvements.; Comparison of behavioral changes between groups.; Differences in patient weight gain.,Cognitive function improvements.; Comparison of behavioral changes between groups.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Evidence based mainly on short-term studies.; Conflict of interest due to industry funding.; Absence of control groups in trials.,Evidence based mainly on short-term studies.; Conflict of interest due to industry funding.,Appropriate due to measurable benefits in cognitive stability.; Inappropriate due to significant adverse effects.; Inappropriate because it leads to rapid disease progression.,Appropriate due to measurable benefits in cognitive stability.
5e27868c5cbbcc0b3599574b,finetuned_5,What are the benefits and risks of eye drops that widen the pupil as an additional treatment for inflammation after a blow to the eye?,"Traumatic eye complaints account for 3% of all hospital emergency department visits. The most common traumatic injury to the eye is blunt trauma, which accounts for 30% of these visits. Blunt trauma frequently leads to traumatic iridocyclitis, thus causing anterior uveitis. Iridocyclitis frequently causes tearing, photophobia, eye pain, and vision loss. These symptoms are a result of the inflammatory processes and ciliary spasms to iris muscles and sphincter. The inflammatory process is usually managed with topical corticosteroids, while the ciliary spasm is blunted by dilating the pupils with topical mydriatic agents, an adjuvant therapy. However, the effectiveness of mydriatic agents has not been quantified in terms of reduction of ocular pain and visual acuity loss.
To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of topical mydriatics as adjunctive therapy to topical corticosteroids for traumatic iridocyclitis.
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register (2019, issue 6); Ovid MEDLINE; Embase.com; Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) Plus; PubMed; ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic search for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 12 June 2019.
We planned to include randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared topical mydriatic agents in conjunction with topical corticosteroid therapy versus topical corticosteroids alone, in participants with traumatic iridocyclitis.
Two review authors (JH, MK) independently screened titles and abstracts, then full-text reports, against eligibility criteria. We planned to have two authors independently extract data from included studies. We resolved differences in opinion by discussion.
There were no eligible RCTs that compared the interventions of interest in people with traumatic iridocyclitis.
We did not find any evidence from RCTs about the efficacy of topical mydriatic agents as an adjunctive therapy with topical corticosteroids for treating traumatic iridocyclitis. In the absence of these types of studies, we cannot draw any firm conclusions. Controlled trials that compare the combined use of topical mydriatic agents and corticosteroid drops against standard corticosteroid drops alone, in people with traumatic iridocyclitis are required. These may provide evidence about the efficacy and risk of topical mydriatic drops as adjuvant therapy for traumatic iridocyclitis.","Hospital emergency departments often treat people with eye injuries. There are two main types of eye injuries: blunt trauma injuries, when an object or force strikes the eye, commonly caused by motor vehicle accidents, sports- or work-related accidents, or fights; and penetrating trauma injuries, when a sharp object or an object traveling at high speed (for example, pellets from air-powered guns) pierces the eye. Blunt trauma is the more common type of injury. People who experience these injuries often develop traumatic iridocyclitis, an inflammation of the iris (the colored part of the eye surrounding the pupil) and the ciliary body (the muscles and tissues around the iris). Traumatic iridocyclitis can develop after both major and minor blunt trauma and can affect both children and adults. Symptoms include eye pain and sensitivity to light. If the inflammation is missed or not treated properly, it can lead to vision loss. The standard treatment for traumatic iridocyclitis is anti-inflammatory eye drops (corticosteroids). Eye drops that widen the pupil (mydriatics) are often added to reduce pain and discomfort and to shorten the duration of symptoms. We aimed to determine whether using mydriatics alongside corticosteroids is more beneficial or causes more unwanted effects than using corticosteroids alone. Specifically, we wanted to know if mydriatics relieve pain and inflammation and improve vision, and whether they cause complications such as chronic pain or serious harm to vision, including blindness. Our team searched the medical literature for randomized controlled trials the most reliable type of study on people of any age with traumatic iridocyclitis that compared mydriatics plus corticosteroids against corticosteroids alone. We found no randomized controlled trials addressing this question. Therefore, we do not know whether adding mydriatics to corticosteroids is helpful or harmful compared with corticosteroids alone. More research is needed, including well-designed trials, to understand the benefits and risks of using mydriatics as an additional treatment for traumatic iridocyclitis.",1053,Topical mydriatic agents; Topical corticosteroids; Traumatic iridocyclitis; Blunt trauma; Anterior uveitis; Ciliary spasms; Photophobia; Inflammatory processes; Adjunctive therapy; Ocular pain,How might the lack of randomized controlled trials affect the implementation of mydriatic agents in clinical practice for traumatic iridocyclitis?,What is the intended benefit of adding mydriatics to corticosteroid treatment for traumatic iridocyclitis?,Select the items that are animals,Describe the condition known as traumatic iridocyclitis.,What standard treatment is used for traumatic iridocyclitis?,"Clinicians may hesitate to use mydriatics due to unclear benefits and risks.; Clinicians can confidently prescribe mydriatics, assuming they're safe.; Clinicians should replace corticosteroids with mydriatics alone.",Clinicians may hesitate to use mydriatics due to unclear benefits and risks.,To relieve pain and improve vision; To reduce allergic reactions; To prevent infection,To relieve pain and improve vision,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,An inflammation of the iris and ciliary body; A breakdown of the retina; A swelling of the cornea,An inflammation of the iris and ciliary body,Anti-inflammatory eye drops (corticosteroids); Antibiotic ointments; Laser eye surgery,Anti-inflammatory eye drops (corticosteroids)
5e27868c5cbbcc0b3599574b,finetuned_6,Collaborative care for people with depression and anxiety,"Common mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety, are estimated to affect up to 15% of the UK population at any one time, and health care systems worldwide need to implement interventions to reduce the impact and burden of these conditions; collaborative care is a complex intervention based on chronic disease management models that may be effective in the management of these common mental health problems. To assess the effectiveness of collaborative care for patients with depression or anxiety, we searched databases to February 2012, including The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group (CCDAN) trials registers (CCDANCTR-References and CCDANCTR-Studies) which include relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from MEDLINE (1950 to present), EMBASE (1974 to present), PsycINFO (1967 to present) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, all years), as well as the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal (ICTRP), ClinicalTrials.gov, and CINAHL (to November 2010 only), and we screened the reference lists of reports of all included studies and published systematic reviews for reports of additional studies. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of collaborative care for participants of all ages with depression or anxiety were included; two independent researchers extracted data using a standardised data extraction sheet, made 'Risk of bias' assessments using criteria from The Cochrane Collaboration, combined continuous measures of outcome using standardised mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), combined dichotomous measures using risk ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs, and conducted sensitivity analyses to test robustness. We included seventy-nine RCTs (including 90 relevant comparisons) involving 24,308 participants in the review, and studies varied in terms of risk of bias. The results of primary analyses demonstrated significantly greater improvement in depression outcomes for adults with depression treated with the collaborative care model in the short-term (SMD -0.34, 95% CI -0.41 to -0.27; RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.43), medium-term (SMD -0.28, 95% CI -0.41 to -0.15; RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.48), and long-term (SMD -0.35, 95% CI -0.46 to -0.24; RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.41); however, these significant benefits were not demonstrated into the very long-term (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.27). The results also demonstrated significantly greater improvement in anxiety outcomes for adults with anxiety treated with the collaborative care model in the short-term (SMD -0.30, 95% CI -0.44 to -0.17; RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.87), medium-term (SMD -0.33, 95% CI -0.47 to -0.19; RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.69), and long-term (SMD -0.20, 95% CI -0.34 to -0.06; RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.42); no comparisons examined the effects of the intervention on anxiety outcomes in the very long-term. There was evidence of benefit in secondary outcomes including medication use, mental health quality of life, and patient satisfaction, although there was less evidence of benefit in physical quality of life. Collaborative care is associated with significant improvement in depression and anxiety outcomes compared with usual care, and represents a useful addition to clinical pathways for adult patients with depression and anxiety.","Many people suffer from depression and anxiety, and these problems can make people feel sad, scared and even suicidal, and can affect their work, their relationships and their quality of life; depression and anxiety can occur because of personal, financial, social or health problems. Collaborative care is an innovative way of treating depression and anxiety and involves a number of health professionals working with a patient to help them overcome their problems; it often involves a medical doctor, a case manager (with training in depression and anxiety), and a mental health specialist such as a psychiatrist, with the case manager having regular contact with the person and organising care together with the medical doctor and specialist, and offering help with medication or access to a talking therapy to help the patient get better. Collaborative care has been tested with patients in a number of countries and health care systems, but it is not clear whether it should be recommended for people with depression or anxiety. In this review we found 79 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (90 comparisons) including 24,308 patients worldwide, comparing collaborative care with routine care or alternative treatments (such as consultation-liaison) for depression and anxiety; there were problems with the methods in some of the studies, for example, the methods used to allocate patients to collaborative care or routine care were not always free from bias, and many patients did not complete follow-up or provide information about their outcomes. Most of the studies focused on depression and the evidence suggests that collaborative care is better than routine care in improving depression for up to two years; a smaller number of studies examined the effect of collaborative care on anxiety and the evidence suggests that collaborative care is also better than usual care in improving anxiety for up to two years. Collaborative care increases the number of patients using medication in line with current guidance, and can improve mental health related quality of life, and patients with depression and anxiety treated with collaborative care are also more satisfied with their treatment.",1114,collaborative care; chronic disease management models; mental health problems; depression outcomes; anxiety outcomes; medication use; mental health quality of life; patient satisfaction; physical quality of life; clinical pathways,Why is there uncertainty about recommending collaborative care for depression and anxiety?,In what ways can collaborative care enhance the treatment of depression and anxiety?,Select the items that are animals,What are the common issues targeted by collaborative care?,How does collaborative care compare with routine care in managing depression?,The impact on very long-term outcomes is unclear.; The intervention is clearly less effective than routine care.; The number of health professionals involved makes it impractical.,The impact on very long-term outcomes is unclear.,By increasing the use of medication in line with guidelines.; By improving long-term physical quality of life.; By reducing the need for professional involvement.,By increasing the use of medication in line with guidelines.,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,Depression and anxiety; Cardiovascular diseases; Infectious diseases,Depression and anxiety,Collaborative care is better at improving depression outcomes; Routine care is more effective; Both have similar effects,Collaborative care is better at improving depression outcomes
5e27868c5cbbcc0b3599574b,finetuned_6,Does personalised advice via computer or mobile devices reduce heavy drinking?,"Excessive alcohol use contributes significantly to physical and psychological illness, injury and death, and a wide array of social harm in all age groups. A proven strategy for reducing excessive alcohol consumption levels is to offer a brief conversation-based intervention in primary care settings, but more recent technological innovations have enabled people to interact directly via computer, mobile device or smartphone with digital interventions designed to address problem alcohol consumption. To assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of digital interventions for reducing hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption, alcohol-related problems, or both, in people living in the community, specifically: (i) Are digital interventions more effective and cost-effective than no intervention (or minimal input) controls? (ii) Are digital interventions at least equally effective as face-to-face brief alcohol interventions? (iii) What are the effective component behaviour change techniques (BCTs) of such interventions and their mechanisms of action? (iv) What theories or models have been used in the development and/or evaluation of the intervention? Secondary objectives were (i) to assess whether outcomes differ between trials where the digital intervention targets participants attending health, social care, education or other community-based settings and those where it is offered remotely via the internet or mobile phone platforms; (ii) to specify interventions according to their mode of delivery (e.g. functionality features) and assess the impact of mode of delivery on outcomes. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ERIC, HTA and Web of Knowledge databases; ClinicalTrials.com and WHO ICTRP trials registers and relevant websites to April 2017. We also checked the reference lists of included trials and relevant systematic reviews. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effectiveness of digital interventions compared with no intervention or with face-to-face interventions for reducing hazardous or harmful alcohol consumption in people living in the community and reported a measure of alcohol consumption. We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. We included 57 studies which randomised a total of 34,390 participants. The main sources of bias were from attrition and participant blinding (36% and 21% of studies respectively, high risk of bias). Forty one studies (42 comparisons, 19,241 participants) provided data for the primary meta-analysis, which demonstrated that participants using a digital intervention drank approximately 23 g alcohol weekly (95% CI 15 to 30) (about 3 UK units) less than participants who received no or minimal interventions at end of follow up (moderate-quality evidence). Fifteen studies (16 comparisons, 10,862 participants) demonstrated that participants who engaged with digital interventions had less than one drinking day per month fewer than no intervention controls (moderate-quality evidence), 15 studies (3587 participants) showed about one binge drinking session less per month in the intervention group compared to no intervention controls (moderate-quality evidence), and in 15 studies (9791 participants) intervention participants drank one unit per occasion less than no intervention control participants (moderate-quality evidence). Only five small studies (390 participants) compared digital and face-to-face interventions. There was no difference in alcohol consumption at end of follow up (MD 0.52 g/week, 95% CI -24.59 to 25.63; low-quality evidence). Thus, digital alcohol interventions produced broadly similar outcomes in these studies. No studies reported whether any adverse effects resulted from the interventions. A median of nine BCTs were used in experimental arms (range = 1 to 22). 'B' is an estimate of effect (MD in quantity of drinking, expressed in g/week) per unit increase in the BCT, and is a way to report whether individual BCTs are linked to the effect of the intervention. The BCTs of goal setting (B -43.94, 95% CI -78.59 to -9.30), problem solving (B -48.03, 95% CI -77.79 to -18.27), information about antecedents (B -74.20, 95% CI -117.72 to -30.68), behaviour substitution (B -123.71, 95% CI -184.63 to -62.80) and credible source (B -39.89, 95% CI -72.66 to -7.11) were significantly associated with reduced alcohol consumption in unadjusted models. In a multivariable model that included BCTs with B > 23 in the unadjusted model, the BCTs of behaviour substitution (B -95.12, 95% CI -162.90 to -27.34), problem solving (B -45.92, 95% CI -90.97 to -0.87), and credible source (B -32.09, 95% CI -60.64 to -3.55) were associated with reduced alcohol consumption. The most frequently mentioned theories or models in the included studies were Motivational Interviewing Theory (7/20), Transtheoretical Model (6/20) and Social Norms Theory (6/20). Over half of the interventions (n = 21, 51%) made no mention of theory. Only two studies used theory to select participants or tailor the intervention. There was no evidence of an association between reporting theory use and intervention effectiveness. There is moderate-quality evidence that digital interventions may lower alcohol consumption, with an average reduction of up to three (UK) standard drinks per week compared to control participants. Substantial heterogeneity and risk of performance and publication bias may mean the reduction was lower. Low-quality evidence from fewer studies suggested there may be little or no difference in impact on alcohol consumption between digital and face-to-face interventions. The BCTs of behaviour substitution, problem solving and credible source were associated with the effectiveness of digital interventions to reduce alcohol consumption and warrant further investigation in an experimental context. Reporting of theory use was very limited and often unclear when present. Over half of the interventions made no reference to any theories. Limited reporting of theory use was unrelated to heterogeneity in intervention effectiveness.","We aimed to find out if personalised advice to reduce heavy drinking provided using a computer or mobile device is better than nothing or printed information. We also compared advice provided using a computer or mobile device to advice given in a face-to-face conversation. The main outcome was how much alcohol people drank.
Heavy drinking causes over 60 diseases, as well as many accidents, injuries and early deaths each year. Brief advice or counselling, delivered by doctors or nurses, can help people reduce their drinking by around 4 to 5 units a week. In the UK, this is around two pints (1.13 L) of beer or half a bottle of wine (375 mL) each week. However, people may be embarrassed by talking about alcohol. The studies included people in workplaces, colleges or health clinics and internet users. Everyone typed information about their drinking into a computer or mobile device - which then gave half the people advice about how much they drank and the effect this has on health. This group also received suggestions about how to cut down on drinking. The other group could sometimes read general health information. Between one month and one year later, everyone was asked to confirm how much they were drinking. Drinking levels in both groups were compared to each other at these time points. Many (56%) studies were funded by government or research foundation funds. Some (11%) were funded by personal awards such as PhD fellowships. The rest did not report sources of funding. We included 57 studies comparing the drinking of people getting advice about alcohol from computers or mobile devices with those who did not after one to 12 months. Of these, 41 studies (42 comparisons, 19,241 participants) focused on the actual amounts that people reported drinking each week. Most people reported drinking less if they received advice about alcohol from a computer or mobile device compared to people who did not get this advice. Evidence shows that the amount of alcohol people cut down may be about 1.5 pints (800 mL) of beer or a third of a bottle of wine (250 mL) each week. Other measures supported the effectiveness of digital alcohol interventions, although the size of the effect tended to be smaller than for overall alcohol consumption. Positive differences in measures of drinking were seen at 1, 6 and 12 months after the advice. There was not enough information to help us decide if advice was better from computers, telephones or the internet to reduce risky drinking. We do not know which pieces of advice were the most important to help people reduce problem drinking. However, advice from trusted people such as doctors seemed helpful, as did recommendations that people think about specific ways they could overcome problems that might prevent them from drinking less and suggestions about things to do instead of drinking. We included five studies which compared the drinking of people who got advice from computers or mobile devices with advice from face-to-face conversations with doctors or nurses; there may be little or no difference between these to reduce heavy drinking. No studies reported whether any harm came from the interventions. Personalised advice using computers or mobile devices may help people reduce heavy drinking better than doing nothing or providing only general health information. Personalised advice through computers or mobile devices may make little or no difference to reduce drinking compared to face-to-face conversation.",1061,brief conversation-based intervention; hazardous alcohol consumption; community-based settings; behavior change techniques; Behavior substitution,What specific behavior change techniques (BCTs) were most strongly associated with the effectiveness of digital interventions?,Which measure was used as a key outcome for assessing digital interventions?,Select the items that are animals,How is the advice delivered through digital interventions typically personalized?,In what way did the results vary when digital interventions were compared with face-to-face advice?,Goal setting and credible source; Behavior substitution and problem-solving; Information about antecedents and behavior substitution,Behavior substitution and problem-solving,How much alcohol people drank; The participants' weight loss; The number of exercise sessions per week,How much alcohol people drank,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,By considering individual drinking habits and health effects; By providing generalized health tips; By sending automated text messages at fixed times,By considering individual drinking habits and health effects,There was little or no difference in effectiveness; Digital was significantly more effective; Face-to-face was significantly more effective,There was little or no difference in effectiveness
602b3ed14ae791260d6d12c5,static_1,Insulin detemir versus insulin glargine for type 2 diabetes mellitus,"Chronically elevated blood glucose levels are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Many diabetes patients will eventually require insulin treatment to maintain good glycaemic control. There are still uncertainties about the optimal insulin treatment regimens for type 2 diabetes, but the long-acting insulin analogues seem beneficial. Several reviews have compared either insulin detemir or insulin glargine to NPH insulin, but research directly comparing both insulin analogues is limited.
To assess the effects of insulin detemir and insulin glargine compared with each other in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, online registries of ongoing trials and abstract books. Date of last search was January 2011.
All randomised controlled trials comparing insulin detemir with insulin glargine with a duration of 12 weeks or longer were included.
Two authors independently selected the studies and extracted the data. Pooling of studies by means of random-effects meta-analysis was performed.
This review examined four trials lasting 24 to 52 weeks involving 2250 people randomised to either insulin detemir or glargine. Overall, risk of bias of the evaluated studies was high. Insulin glargine was dosed once-daily in the evening. Insulin detemir was initiated once-daily in the evening with the option of an additional dose in the morning in three studies and initiated twice-daily in one study. Of randomised patients 13.6% to 57.2% were injecting insulin detemir twice-daily at the end of trial. Glycaemic control, measured by glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and HbA1c equal to or less than 7% with or without hypoglycaemia, did not differ statistically significantly between treatment groups. The results showed no significant differences in overall, nocturnal and severe hypoglycaemia between treatment groups. Insulin detemir was associated with less weight gain. Treatment with insulin glargine resulted in a lower daily basal insulin dose and a lower number of injection site reactions. There was no significant difference in the variability of FPG or glucose values in 24-hour profiles between treatment groups. It was not possible to draw conclusions on quality of life, costs or mortality. Only one trial reported results on health-related quality of life and showed no significant differences between treatment groups.
Our analyses suggest that there is no clinically relevant difference in efficacy or safety between insulin detemir and insulin glargine for targeting hyperglycaemia. However, to achieve the same glycaemic control insulin detemir was often injected twice-daily in a higher dose but with less weight gain, while insulin glargine was injected once-daily, with somewhat fewer injection site reactions.","The two long-acting insulin analogues (artificial insulins), insulin detemir or insulin glargine differ in their mechanism of attaining protracted action, leading to possible differences in glycaemic control and safety outcomes. Several studies have compared either insulin detemir or insulin glargine to NPH (Neutral Protamin Hagedorn) insulin. Research directly comparing both long-acting insulin analogues is limited.
Our aim was to systematically review the efficacy and safety of insulin detemir and insulin glargine in head-to-head studies in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Four studies investigated a total of 2250 people. Trials lasted between 24 and 52 weeks. Overall, risk of bias of the evaluated studies was high. Our analysis of these intermediate term trials comparing insulin detemir with insulin glargine showed that these two insulins were equally effective in achieving and maintaining glycaemic control (glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)). There were no differences in overall, nocturnal and severe hypoglycaemia when comparing insulin detemir to insulin glargine. Insulin detemir was associated with significantly less weight gain (one study showing a difference of 0.9 kg). Treatment with insulin glargine resulted in a lower daily basal insulin dose and a lower number of injection site reactions (1.8% of patients treated with insulin detemir compared to 0.4% of patients treated with insulin glargine had injection side reactions).
There was no difference in the variability of fasting glucose levels or the variability of glucose values of 24-hour profiles between the two treatment groups.
From the retrieved trials it was not possible to draw conclusions on the effects of these two insulins on quality of life, their costs or on the number of fatalities. Only one trial reported results on health-related quality of life and showed no significant differences between treatment groups.

602b3ed14ae791260d6d12c5,static_2,Do physical measures such as hand-washing or wearing masks stop or slow down the spread of respiratory viruses?,"Viral epidemics or pandemics of acute respiratory infections (ARIs) pose a global threat, such as the influenza (H1N1) pandemic in 2009 caused by the H1N1pdm09 virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 in 2019, and antiviral drugs and vaccines may be insufficient to prevent their spread; this is an update of a Cochrane Review last published in 2020 and includes results from studies conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. The objective was to assess the effectiveness of physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of acute respiratory viruses. We searched CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and two trials registers in October 2022, with backward and forward citation analysis. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-RCTs investigating physical interventions (screening at entry ports, isolation, quarantine, physical distancing, personal protection, hand hygiene, face masks, glasses, and gargling) to prevent respiratory virus transmission, and used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We included 11 new RCTs and cluster-RCTs (610,872 participants), bringing the total to 78; six were conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic (two from Mexico, and one each from Denmark, Bangladesh, England, and Norway), and we identified four ongoing studies, one completed but unreported, evaluating masks during COVID-19. Many studies were conducted during non-epidemic influenza periods, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, or influenza seasons up to 2016, meaning many occurred under lower viral circulation compared with COVID-19; settings varied widely, from suburban schools to hospital wards in high-income countries, crowded inner-city areas in low-income countries, and an immigrant neighbourhood in a high-income country, and adherence to interventions was low in many studies, with risk of bias mostly high or unclear. We included 12 trials comparing medical/surgical masks versus no masks (two in healthcare workers and 10 in the community); wearing masks in the community probably makes little or no difference in influenza-like illness/COVID-like illness compared to not wearing masks (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.09; 9 trials, 276,917 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and probably makes little or no difference in laboratory-confirmed influenza/SARS-CoV-2 (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.42; 6 trials, 13,919 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), with harms rarely measured. For N95/P2 respirators compared to medical/surgical masks, pooled trials (four in healthcare settings and one in a household) show very uncertain effects on clinical respiratory illness (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.10; 3 trials, 7779 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and they may be effective for ILI (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.03; 5 trials, 8407 participants; low-certainty evidence); for laboratory-confirmed influenza, N95/P2 respirators probably make little or no difference (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.34; 5 trials, 8407 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Restricting analyses to healthcare workers made no difference; harms were poorly measured, though discomfort was reported. One recently published RCT found medical/surgical masks non-inferior to N95 respirators in 1009 healthcare workers across four countries treating COVID-19 patients. For hand hygiene, 19 trials compared interventions with controls across schools, childcare centres, and homes; hand hygiene resulted in a 14% relative reduction in ARIs (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.90; 9 trials, 52,105 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), reducing cases from 380 to 327 per 1000 people. For ILI (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.09; 11 trials, 34,503 participants; low-certainty evidence) and laboratory-confirmed influenza (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.30; 8 trials, 8332 participants; low-certainty evidence), effects suggested little or no difference. Pooled data from 19 trials (71,210 participants) for ARI/ILI/influenza found hand hygiene may be beneficial with an 11% relative reduction (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.94; low-certainty evidence), though with high heterogeneity; harms were rarely reported. No RCTs were found for gowns and gloves, face shields, or screening at entry ports. The high risk of bias, variation in outcome measurement, and low adherence hinder firm conclusions; additional RCTs during the pandemic existed but were relatively few despite the importance of evaluating masking and adherence, especially in vulnerable groups. There remains uncertainty about the effects of face masks, with low to moderate certainty meaning confidence is limited and true effects may differ; pooled RCTs did not show a clear reduction in respiratory viral infection with medical/surgical masks, and no clear difference was seen between medical/surgical masks and N95/P2 respirators in healthcare workers providing routine care. Hand hygiene is likely to modestly reduce respiratory illness, though not significantly for ILI or laboratory-confirmed influenza. Harms were under-investigated. There is a need for large, well-designed RCTs across multiple settings and populations to evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions and the impact of adherence, especially among those at highest risk of ARIs.","Respiratory viruses are viruses that infect the cells in your airways: nose, throat, and lungs and these infections can cause serious problems and affect normal breathing, leading to illnesses such as flu (influenza), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and COVID-19. People infected with a respiratory virus spread virus particles into the air when they cough or sneeze, and others become infected if they come into contact with these particles in the air or on surfaces; respiratory viruses can spread quickly through communities, populations, countries (causing epidemics), and around the world (causing pandemics). Physical measures to try to prevent respiratory viruses spreading include washing hands often; not touching your eyes, nose, or mouth; sneezing or coughing into your elbow; wiping surfaces with disinfectant; wearing masks, eye protection, gloves, and gowns; avoiding contact with other people (isolation or quarantine); keeping a distance from others; and screening people entering a country for signs of infection. We wanted to find out whether physical measures stop or slow the spread of respiratory viruses from well-controlled randomised controlled trials comparing one intervention to another. We searched for randomised controlled studies that looked at physical measures to stop people acquiring a respiratory virus infection and were interested in how many people caught a respiratory virus infection and whether the physical measures had unwanted effects. We identified 78 relevant studies conducted in low-, middle-, and high-income countries in hospitals, schools, homes, offices, childcare centres, and communities during non-epidemic influenza periods, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, influenza seasons up to 2016, and during the COVID-19 pandemic; five ongoing, unpublished studies were found, two evaluating masks for COVID-19, with five trials funded by government and pharmaceutical companies, and nine funded by pharmaceutical companies. No studies looked at face shields, gowns and gloves, or screening at borders. We assessed the effects of medical or surgical masks, N95/P2 respirators (close-fitting masks filtering inhaled air, mostly used by healthcare workers), and hand hygiene (hand-washing or hand sanitiser). For medical or surgical masks, ten studies took place in the community and two in healthcare workers; compared with wearing no mask (community studies only), wearing a mask may make little to no difference in how many people caught a flu-like or COVID-like illness (9 studies; 276,917 people), and probably makes little or no difference in how many had flu or COVID confirmed by a lab test (6 studies; 13,919 people), with discomfort rarely reported. For N95/P2 respirators, four studies were in healthcare workers and one small study in the community; compared with wearing surgical masks, N95/P2 respirators probably make little to no difference in confirmed flu (5 studies; 8407 people) and may make little to no difference in flu-like illness (5 studies; 8407 people) or respiratory illness (3 studies; 7799 people), with discomfort mentioned. For hand hygiene, following a hand hygiene programme may reduce respiratory or flu-like illness or confirmed flu compared with no programme (19 studies; 71,210 people), although the reduction was not statistically confirmed when ILI and lab-confirmed ILI were analysed separately; few studies measured unwanted effects, with skin irritation from sanitiser mentioned. Our confidence in these results is generally low to moderate for subjective outcomes such as respiratory illness, but moderate for more precise laboratory-confirmed infection outcomes related to masks and N95/P2 respirators; results may change with more evidence, and adherence to mask-wearing and hand hygiene was relatively low, which may have affected study outcomes.",1111,acute respiratory infections (ARIs); SARS-CoV-2; H1N1pdm09 virus; severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS); N95/P2 respirators; laboratory-confirmed influenza; influenza-like illness (ILI); physical interventions; antiviral drugs; viral epidemics,What can be deduced about the effectiveness of physical interventions such as masks in different settings from the studyÃ¢ÂÂs findings?,What criteria can be used to evaluate the reliability of the study's conclusions about the use of hand hygiene?,Select all of the following that are fruits,What are the implications of the studyÃ¢ÂÂs findings for the future design of respiratory virus prevention trials?,How could the limited findings on harms associated with interventions impact public health policies?,Masks show consistent effectiveness across all settings.; Effectiveness of masks is inconsistent across different settings.; Masks are ineffective in low-income settings.,Effectiveness of masks is inconsistent across different settings.,The number of trials and participants involved in the hand hygiene studies.; The consistency of outcomes across different respiratory diseases.; The number of different viruses tested in isolation settings only.,The number of trials and participants involved in the hand hygiene studies.; The consistency of outcomes across different respiratory diseases.,dog; blue; grape,grape,Designing trials with a focus on heterogeneous settings and high adherence to interventions.; Excluding healthcare worker settings to focus on community settings only.; Including a wider range of physical interventions besides masks and hand hygiene.,Designing trials with a focus on heterogeneous settings and high adherence to interventions.; Including a wider range of physical interventions besides masks and hand hygiene.,Policies may proceed cautiously due to potential undisclosed harms.; Limited harm reporting justifies the unrestricted use of interventions.; It necessitates further research to guide evidence-based policy decisions.,Policies may proceed cautiously due to potential undisclosed harms.; It necessitates further research to guide evidence-based policy decisions.
602b3ed14ae791260d6d12c5,static_2,Metformin and sulphonylurea combination therapy for adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus,"The number of people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is increasing worldwide. The combination of metformin and sulphonylurea (M+S) is a widely used treatment. Whether M+S shows better or worse effects in comparison with other antidiabetic medications for people with T2DM is still controversial. To assess the effects of metformin and sulphonylurea (second- or third-generation) combination therapy for adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
We updated the search of a recent systematic review from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). The updated search included CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP. The date of the last search was March 2018. We searched manufacturers' websites and reference lists of included trials, systematic reviews, meta-analyses and health technology assessment reports. We asked investigators of the included trials for information about additional trials. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) randomising participants 18 years old or more with T2DM to M+S compared with metformin plus another glucose-lowering intervention or metformin monotherapy with a treatment duration of 52 weeks or more. Two review authors read all abstracts and full-text articles and records, assessed risk of bias and extracted outcome data independently. We used a random-effects model to perform meta-analysis, and calculated risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes, using 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for effect estimates. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE instrument. We included 32 RCTs randomising 28,746 people. Treatment duration ranged between one to four years. We judged none of these trials as low risk of bias for all 'Risk of bias' domains. Most important events per person were all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, serious adverse events (SAE), non-fatal stroke (NFS), non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) and microvascular complications. Most important comparisons were as follows: Five trials compared M+S (N = 1194) with metformin plus a glucagon-like peptide 1 analogue (N = 1675): all-cause mortality was 11/1057 (1%) versus 11/1537 (0.7%), risk ratio (RR) 1.15 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to 2.67); 3 trials; 2594 participants; low-certainty evidence; cardiovascular mortality 1/307 (0.3%) versus 1/302 (0.3%), low-certainty evidence; serious adverse events (SAE) 128/1057 (12.1%) versus 194/1537 (12.6%), RR 0.90 (95% CI 0.73 to 1.11); 3 trials; 2594 participants; very low-certainty evidence; non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) 2/549 (0.4%) versus 6/1026 (0.6%), RR 0.57 (95% CI 0.12 to 2.82); 2 trials; 1575 participants; very low-certainty evidence.

Eleven trials compared M+S (N = 3626) with metformin plus a thiazolidinedione (N = 3685): all-cause mortality was 123/3300 (3.7%) versus 114/3354 (3.4%), RR 1.09 (95% CI 0.85 to 1.40); 6 trials; 6654 participants; low-certainty evidence; cardiovascular mortality 37/2946 (1.3%) versus 41/2994 (1.4%), RR 0.78 (95% CI 0.36 to 1.67); 4 trials; 5940 participants; low-certainty evidence; SAE 666/3300 (20.2%) versus 671/3354 (20%), RR 1.01 (95% CI 0.93 to 1.11); 6 trials; 6654 participants; very low-certainty evidence; NFS 20/1540 (1.3%) versus 16/1583 (1%), RR 1.29 (95% CI 0.67 to 2.47); P = 0.45; 2 trials; 3123 participants; very low-certainty evidence; non-fatal MI 25/1841 (1.4%) versus 21/1877 (1.1%), RR 1.21 (95% CI 0.68 to 2.14); P = 0.51; 3 trials; 3718 participants; very low-certainty evidence; three trials (3123 participants) reported no microvascular complications (very low-certainty evidence). Three trials compared M+S (N = 462) with metformin plus a glinide (N = 476): one person died in each intervention group (3 trials; 874 participants; low-certainty evidence); no cardiovascular mortality (2 trials; 446 participants; low-certainty evidence); SAE 34/424 (8%) versus 27/450 (6%), RR 1.68 (95% CI 0.54 to 5.21); P = 0.37; 3 trials; 874 participants; low-certainty evidence; no NFS (1 trial; 233 participants; very low-certainty evidence); non-fatal MI 2/215 (0.9%) participants in the M+S group; 2 trials; 446 participants; low-certainty evidence; no microvascular complications (1 trial; 233 participants; low-certainty evidence). Four trials compared M+S (N = 2109) with metformin plus a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor (N = 3032): all-cause mortality was 13/2107 (0.6%) versus 19/3027 (0.6%), RR 0.96 (95% CI 0.44 to 2.09); 4 trials; 5134 participants; very low-certainty evidence; cardiovascular mortality 4/1327 (0.3%) versus 6/2262 (0.3%), RR 1.22 (95% CI 0.33 to 4.41); 3 trials; 3589 participants; very low-certainty evidence; SAE 315/2107 (15.5%) versus 375/3027 (12.4%), RR 1.02 (95% CI 0.76 to 1.37); 4 trials; 5134 participants; very low-certainty evidence; NFS 3/919 (0.3%) versus 7/1856 (0.4%), RR 0.87 (95% CI 0.22 to 3.34); 2 trials; 2775 participants; very low-certainty evidence; non-fatal MI 7/890 (0.8%) versus 8/1374 (0.6%), RR 1.43 (95% CI 0.49 to 4.18; 2 trials); 2264 participants; very low-certainty evidence; amputation of lower extremity 1/437 (0.2%) versus 1/888 (0.1%); very low-certainty evidence. Trials reported more hypoglycaemic episodes with M+S combination compared to all other metformin-antidiabetic agent combinations. Results for M+S versus metformin monotherapy were inconclusive. There were no RCTs comparing M+S with metformin plus insulin. We identified nine ongoing trials and two trials are awaiting assessment. Together these trials will include approximately 16,631 participants. There is inconclusive evidence whether M+S combination therapy compared with metformin plus another glucose-lowering intervention results in benefit or harm for most patient-important outcomes (mortality, SAEs, macrovascular and microvascular complications) with the exception of hypoglycaemia (more harm for M+S combination). No RCT reported on health-related quality of life.","We wanted to investigate the effects of the combination of the antidiabetic medications metformin plus sulphonylurea compared with other antidiabetic interventions in people with type 2 diabetes.
Many people with type 2 diabetes are treated with several types of glucose-lowering drugs such as 'sulphonylureas' (for example glibenclamide or glyburide, glipizide and gliclazide). These medications lower blood glucose by stimulating the secretion of insulin in the body, thereby increasing insulin levels in the blood. Another antidiabetic agent, metformin lowers blood glucose by improving the body's ability to make insulin work better (insulin sensitivity). The combination of metformin plus sulphonylurea is widely used. We wanted to investigate the effects of metformin plus sulphonylurea on patient-important outcomes such as complications of diabetes (for example kidney and eye disease, heart attacks, strokes), death from any cause, health-related quality of life and side effects of the medications. We found 32 randomised controlled studies (clinical trials where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups), which allocated 28,746 people with type 2 diabetes to either metformin plus sulphonylurea or a comparator group. The comparator groups consisted of the following types of antidiabetic medications in addition to metformin: five studies with glucagon-like peptide 1 analogues, nine studies with dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 inhibitors, 11 studies with thiazolidinediones, three studies with glinides and four studies with sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors. Participants of the studies were treated for between one and four years. There were big differences between people taking part in the studies, especially with regard to age, how long people had diabetes and whether diabetes complications were present at the start of the study. All included studies had deficiencies in the way they were conducted or how study authors reported the results. For individual comparisons of the antidiabetic medications the number of participants was often small, resulting in a high risk of random error (play of chance).",1009,type 2 diabetes mellitus; metformin; sulphonylurea; glucose-lowering intervention; hypoglycaemic episodes; microvascular complications; risk ratio (RR); cardiovascular mortality; serious adverse events (SAE); non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI),What conclusions can be drawn about the certainty of the evidence regarding the use of M+S in comparison to other therapies?,What was the main motivation for the study on metformin plus sulphonylurea?,Select the items that are animals,Which antidiabetic medication combination was a focus of this study?,What are some important outcomes assessed in the study?,The evidence is generally low-certainty due to study design deficiencies.; The evidence is conclusive and reliable for clinical recommendations.; The certainty varies significantly across different comparisons.,The evidence is generally low-certainty due to study design deficiencies.; The certainty varies significantly across different comparisons.,To determine side effects of metformin plus sulphonylurea; To investigate effects compared with other antidiabetic interventions; To find a cure for type 2 diabetes,To investigate effects compared with other antidiabetic interventions,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,Metformin plus insulin; Metformin plus sulphonylurea; Metformin plus diet modification,Metformin plus sulphonylurea,Health-related quality of life; Increase in muscle mass; Complications of diabetes,Health-related quality of life; Complications of diabetes
602b3ed14ae791260d6d12c5,interactive_3,Quality improvement strategies for diabetes care: Effects on outcomes for adults living with diabetes,"There is a large body of evidence evaluating quality improvement (QI) programmes to improve care for adults living with diabetes. These programmes are often comprised of multiple QI strategies, which may be implemented in various combinations. Decision-makers planning to implement or evaluate a new QI programme, or both, need reliable evidence on the relative effectiveness of different QI strategies (individually and in combination) for different patient populations.
To update existing systematic reviews of diabetes QI programmes and apply novel meta-analytical techniques to estimate the effectiveness of QI strategies (individually and in combination) on diabetes quality of care.
We searched databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL) and trials registers (ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP) to 4 June 2019. We conducted a top-up search to 23 September 2021; we screened these search results and 42 studies meeting our eligibility criteria are available in the awaiting classification section.
We included randomised trials that assessed a QI programme to improve care in outpatient settings for people living with diabetes. QI programmes needed to evaluate at least one system- or provider-targeted QI strategy alone or in combination with a patient-targeted strategy. - System-targeted: case management (CM); team changes (TC); electronic patient registry (EPR); facilitated relay of clinical information (FR); continuous quality improvement (CQI). - Provider-targeted: audit and feedback (AF); clinician education (CE); clinician reminders (CR); financial incentives (FI). - Patient-targeted: patient education (PE); promotion of self-management (PSM); patient reminders (PR). Patient-targeted QI strategies needed to occur with a minimum of one provider or system-targeted strategy.
We dual-screened search results and abstracted data on study design, study population and QI strategies. We assessed the impact of the programmes on 13 measures of diabetes care, including: glycaemic control (e.g. mean glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c)); cardiovascular risk factor management (e.g. mean systolic blood pressure (SBP), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), proportion of people living with diabetes that quit smoking or receiving cardiovascular medications); and screening/prevention of microvascular complications (e.g. proportion of patients receiving retinopathy or foot screening); and harms (e.g. proportion of patients experiencing adverse hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia). We modelled the association of each QI strategy with outcomes using a series of hierarchical multivariable meta-regression models in a Bayesian framework. The previous version of this review identified that different strategies were more or less effective depending on baseline levels of outcomes. To explore this further, we extended the main additive model for continuous outcomes (HbA1c, SBP and LDL-C) to include an interaction term between each strategy and average baseline risk for each study (baseline thresholds were based on a data-driven approach; we used the median of all baseline values reported in the trials). Based on model diagnostics, the baseline interaction models for HbA1c, SBP and LDL-C performed better than the main model and are therefore presented as the primary analyses for these outcomes. Based on the model results, we qualitatively ordered each QI strategy within three tiers (Top, Middle, Bottom) based on its magnitude of effect relative to the other QI strategies, where 'Top' indicates that the QI strategy was likely one of the most effective strategies for that specific outcome. Secondary analyses explored the sensitivity of results to choices in model specification and priors. Additional information about the methods and results of the review are available as Appendices in an online repository. This review will be maintained as a living systematic review; we will update our syntheses as more data become available.
We identified 553 trials (428 patient-randomised and 125 cluster-randomised trials), including a total of 412,161 participants. Of the included studies, 66% involved people living with type 2 diabetes only. Participants were 50% female and the median age of participants was 58.4 years. The mean duration of follow-up was 12.5 months. HbA1c was the commonest reported outcome; screening outcomes and outcomes related to cardiovascular medications, smoking and harms were reported infrequently. The most frequently evaluated QI strategies across all study arms were PE, PSM and CM, while the least frequently evaluated QI strategies included AF, FI and CQI. Our confidence in the evidence is limited due to a lack of information on how studies were conducted. Four QI strategies (CM, TC, PE, PSM) were consistently identified as 'Top' across the majority of outcomes. All QI strategies were ranked as 'Top' for at least one key outcome. The majority of effects of individual QI strategies were modest, but when used in combination could result in meaningful population-level improvements across the majority of outcomes. The median number of QI strategies in multicomponent QI programmes was three. Combinations of the three most effective QI strategies were estimated to lead to the below effects: - PR + PSM + CE: decrease in HbA1c by 0.41% (credibility interval (CrI) -0.61 to -0.22) when baseline HbA1c < 8.3%; - CM + PE + EPR: decrease in HbA1c by 0.62% (CrI -0.84 to -0.39) when baseline HbA1c > 8.3%; - PE + TC + PSM: reduction in SBP by 2.14 mmHg (CrI -3.80 to -0.52) when baseline SBP < 136 mmHg; - CM + TC + PSM: reduction in SBP by 4.39 mmHg (CrI -6.20 to -2.56) when baseline SBP > 136 mmHg; - TC + PE + CM: LDL-C lowering of 5.73 mg/dL (CrI -7.93 to -3.61) when baseline LDL < 107 mg/dL; - TC + CM + CR: LDL-C lowering by 5.52 mg/dL (CrI -9.24 to -1.89) when baseline LDL > 107 mg/dL. Assuming a baseline screening rate of 50%, the three most effective QI strategies were estimated to lead to an absolute improvement of 33% in retinopathy screening (PE + PR + TC) and 38% absolute increase in foot screening (PE + TC + Other).
There is a significant body of evidence about QI programmes to improve the management of diabetes. Multicomponent QI programmes for diabetes care (comprised of effective QI strategies) may achieve meaningful population-level improvements across the majority of outcomes. For health system decision-makers, the evidence summarised in this review can be used to identify strategies to include in QI programmes. For researchers, this synthesis identifies higher-priority QI strategies to examine in further research regarding how to optimise their evaluation and effects. We will maintain this as a living systematic review.","Diabetes, a disorder of how sugar is managed by the body, can lead to complications such as heart disease and blindness. If people with diabetes get the best possible treatment, their risk for these and other diabetes-related complications will be lowered. Unfortunately, many people with diabetes do not get the best possible treatment.
Quality improvement programmes using different strategies help healthcare professionals improve care. We examined 12 common types of quality improvement strategies.
- Four strategies were directed at healthcare professionals: audit and feedback, clinician education, clinician reminders and financial incentives.
- Three strategies were directed at people living with diabetes: patient education, patient reminders and promotion of self-management.
- Five strategies involved healthcare organisations: case management, team changes, electronic patient registry, facilitated relay of clinical information and continuous quality improvement.
We wanted to find out which strategies worked best to improve:
- blood sugar control (measured using a test called glycated haemoglobin or HbA1c);
- blood pressure;
- low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C).
Lower levels on these tests are associated with lower rates of complications such as heart attacks.
We also assessed whether quality improvement strategies improved rates of screening for eye damage (also known as retinopathy) and loss of sensation in the foot (also known as neuropathy). Routine screening for these issues in people living with diabetes is recommended to prevent blindness or amputation, respectively.
We searched for randomised trials including adults living with diabetes managed in outpatient settings, which evaluated at least one quality improvement strategy. Although we were interested in strategies directed at people living with diabetes, patient strategies needed to be tested in combination with strategies directed at healthcare organisations or professionals for the study to be included. We summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods, size and other considerations.
We found 553 studies that involved 412,161 people with diabetes up to the year 2019. Studies took place in countries around the world with most being conducted in the USA (231) and in medical settings.
Most studies (367) involved people with type 2 diabetes. Half of the study participants were female. The average age of participants was 57 years. Most studies lasted 12 months.
Studies usually used multiple quality improvement strategies together. Most commonly, studies featured three quality improvement strategies.
Overall, case management, team changes, patient education and promotion of self-management appeared to be the most effective quality improvement strategies for diabetes care.
When considering three-strategy combinations (the median number of quality improvement strategies in multicomponent interventions), the combination of clinician education, promotion of self-management and patient reminders may lead to the most improvement in blood sugar control in people who begin with lower HbA1c. Whereas the combination of case management, patient education and electronic patient registries may lead to the largest improvement in blood sugar control for people who begin with higher HbA1c.
For blood pressure, people who have lower systolic blood pressure may see the most improvement with the combination of patient education, team changes and promotion of self-management. People who have higher systolic blood pressure may improve the most with the combination of case management, team changes and promotion of self-management.
For cholesterol, we found that team changes, patient education and case management may lead to the most improvement in people who already have lower low-density lipoprotein levels. For those who have higher levels of low-density lipoprotein, team changes, case management and clinician reminders may lead to the largest improvement.
Patient education, patient reminders and team changes may lead to an increase in retinopathy screening rates. Patient education, team changes and audit and feedback, financial incentives and continuous quality improvement strategies combined may lead to an increase in foot screening rates.
Clinics can improve their diabetes care by engaging in quality improvement programmes (especially those including case management, team changes, patient education and patient self-management).
Many studies did not provide information on everything we were interested in. Most focused on blood sugar control and few studies reported screening rates. We included studies in this review that had important flaws in the way they were conducted, which limits how confident we can be in our findings.
The evidence for this review is up-to-date to June 2019, and we have further searched for and screened studies up to September 2021.

602b3ed14ae791260d6d12c5,interactive_4,Bezafibrate for primary biliary cirrhosis,"Treatment of primary biliary cirrhosis is complicated, and although some studies suggest that bezafibrate, alone or with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), may be effective, no systematic review had summarised the evidence. This review assessed the beneficial and harmful effects of bezafibrate in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. Searches of multiple databases including the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP were conducted up to late 2011, along with Chinese databases up to January 2011, and manufacturers and authors were contacted. All randomised clinical trials comparing bezafibrate at any dose or regimen with placebo, no intervention, or another drug were included, allowing concomitant interventions if equally applied to all groups. Two authors extracted data, and analyses used risk ratios or risk differences for dichotomous data, mean differences for continuous data, and trial sequential analysis to assess random errors. Six trials with 151 Japanese patients were included, all at high risk of bias; four trials compared bezafibrate plus UDCA with no intervention plus UDCA, and two compared bezafibrate with UDCA. No patients died or developed liver-related complications. Bezafibrate had no significant effect on adverse events compared with no intervention (5/32 vs 0/28; RR 5.40, 95% CI 0.69 to 42.32) or UDCA (2/32 vs 0/37; RR 6.19, 95% CI 0.31 to 122.05). Bezafibrate significantly reduced serum alkaline phosphatase activity compared with no intervention (MD -186.04 U/L, 95% CI -249.03 to -123.04) and compared with UDCA (MD -162.90 U/L, 95% CI -199.68 to -126.12), with results supported by trial sequential analyses. Compared with no intervention, bezafibrate also significantly reduced plasma immunoglobulin M (MD -164.00 mg/dl, 95% CI -259.47 to -68.53) and serum bilirubin (MD -0.19 mg/dl, 95% CI -0.38 to -0.00), though these two findings were not supported by trial sequential analyses. Bezafibrate showed no significant effect on serum gamma-glutamyltransferase or alanine aminotransferase compared with no intervention. Compared with UDCA, bezafibrate showed no significant effects on these enzymes or immunoglobulin M in random-effects models, but fixed-effect models suggested significant decreases in all three markers. One patient discontinued bezafibrate due to an adverse event. Overall, bezafibrate showed no effect on mortality, liver-related morbidity, adverse events, or pruritus compared with no intervention or UDCA, and none of the trials assessed quality of life or fatigue. Although bezafibrate may improve some liver biochemical measures, these findings may reflect bias or random error. More rigorous randomised clinical trials are needed.","Primary biliary cirrhosis is a chronic disease of the liver that is characterised by progressive inflammation and destruction of the liver tissue, eventually progressing to liver cirrhosis and the need for liver transplantation. Primary biliary cirrhosis primarily affects middle-aged women. Bezafibrate is a hypolipidaemic agent used in treatment of hypertriglyceridaemia. There are studies suggesting that bezafibrate, alone or in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid, is effective in treatment of primary biliary cirrhosis. Mechanisms through which bezafibrate improves lipid serum concentration balance and prevents biliary cell damage still need to be fully understood. This review evaluates all data on the benefits and harms of bezafibrate for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis in randomised clinical trials. The findings of this review are based on six randomised clinical trials with 151 Japanese patients. Bezafibrate was compared with no intervention in four trials (with co-intervention of ursodeoxycholic acid in both the bezafibrate and control groups) and with ursodeoxycholic acid in two trials. The primary findings of the review are that bezafibrate has no statistically significant effects on mortality, liver-related morbidity, adverse events, and quality of life of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. A possible positive intervention effect of bezafibrate versus no intervention on liver biochemistry measures can be real but could also be due to systematic errors or random errors. The benefits and harms of bezafibrate for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis need further assessment in randomised clinical trials comparing bezafibrate with placebo. Such trials ought to be conducted with impeccable methodology to reduce the risks of random errors and sufficiently large patient groups to reduce the risks of random errors.",1096,bezafibrate; primary biliary cirrhosis; ursodeoxycholic acid; liver-related complications; plasma immunoglobulin M; serum bilirubin; serum gamma-glutamyltransferase; alanine aminotransferase; liver biochemical measures; pruritus,What are the primary motivations for conducting a systematic review on bezafibrate in primary biliary cirrhosis?,How could the findings of this review affect future research directions in liver treatment?,Select all of the following that are colors,How should the potential for systematic or random errors influence the interpretation of bezafibrateÃ¢ÂÂs effects?,What did the trials compare bezafibrate with?,To consolidate existing evidence from scattered studies; To develop new treatment protocols; To address the lack of definitive conclusions regarding its efficacy,To consolidate existing evidence from scattered studies; To address the lack of definitive conclusions regarding its efficacy,By discouraging further trials on bezafibrate; By highlighting the need for rigorously conducted trials; By confirming the current clinical guidelines,By highlighting the need for rigorously conducted trials,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,It should be considered as a major limitation in assessing benefits; It validates the significance of the findings; It suggests that bezafibrate's benefits are entirely due to error,It should be considered as a major limitation in assessing benefits,No intervention and ursodeoxycholic acid; Placebo and vitamins; Dietary changes only,No intervention and ursodeoxycholic acid
602b3ed14ae791260d6d12c5,interactive_4,Does treatment with GLP-1 receptor agonists prevent complications for people with chronic kidney disease and diabetes?,"Approximately 40% of people with diabetes develop kidney failure and experience an accelerated risk of cardiovascular complications. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are glucose-lowering agents that manage glucose and weight control.
We assessed the benefits and harms of GLP-1 receptor agonists in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes.
The Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies was searched to 10 September 2024 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.
Randomised controlled studies were eligible if participants with diabetes and CKD were randomly allocated to a GLP-1 receptor agonist, placebo, standard care or a second glucose-lowering agent. CKD included all stages (from 1 to 5).
Three authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias using the risk of bias assessment tool 2. Pooled analyses using summary estimates of effects were obtained using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and/or hazard ratio (HR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. The primary outcomes included death (all-cause and cardiovascular), 3- and 4-point major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), kidney failure, composite kidney outcome, and severe hypoglycaemia. The secondary outcomes included non-fatal or fatal myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke, non-fatal peripheral arterial events, heart failure, hospitalisation due to heart failure, estimated glomerular filtration rate or creatinine clearance, doubling of serum creatinine, urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio, albuminuria progression, vascular access outcomes, body weight, body mass index, fatigue, life participation, peritoneal dialysis infection, peritoneal dialysis failure, adverse events, serious adverse events, withdrawal due to adverse events, HbA1c, sudden death, acute MI, ischaemic stroke, and coronary revascularisation. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.
Forty-two studies involving 48,148 participants were included. All studies were conducted on people with type 2 diabetes, and no studies were carried out on children. The median study age was 66 years. The median study follow-up was 26 weeks. Six studies were conducted in people with CKD stages 1-2, 11 studies in people with CKD stages 3-5, one study in people on dialysis, and the remaining studies included people with both CKD stages 1-2 and 3-5. Risks of bias in the included studies for all the primary outcomes in studies that compared GLP-1 receptor agonists to placebo were low in most methodological domains, except one study that was assessed at high risk of bias due to missing outcome data for death (all-cause and cardiovascular). The overall risk of bias for all-cause and cardiovascular death in studies that reported the treatment effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists compared to standard care, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors or sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors were assessed as unclear or at high risk of bias due to deviations from intended interventions or missing data. For GLP-1 receptor agonists compared to insulin or another GLP-1 receptor agonist, the risk of bias for all-cause and cardiovascular death was low or unclear. Compared to placebo, GLP-1 receptor agonists probably reduced the risk of all-cause death (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.98; I²= 23%; 8 studies, 17,861 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), but may have little or no effect on cardiovascular death (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.05; I²= 42%; 7 studies, 17,801 participants; low-certainty evidence). Compared to placebo, GLP-1 receptor agonists probably decreased 3-point MACE (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.98; I² = 65%; 4 studies, 19,825 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and 4-point MACE compared to placebo (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.89; 1 study, 2,158 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Based on absolute risks of clinical outcomes, it is likely that GLP-1 receptor agonists prevent all-cause death in 52 people with CKD stages 1-2 and 116 in CKD stages 3-5, cardiovascular death in 34 people with CKD stages 1-2 and 71 in CKD stages 3-5, while 95 CKD stages 1-2 and 153 in CKD stages 3-5 might experience a major cardiovascular event for every 1000 people treated over 1 year. Compared to placebo, GLP-1 receptor agonists probably had little or no effect on kidney failure, defined as starting dialysis or kidney transplant (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.13; I²= 0%; 3 studies, 4,134 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), or on composite kidney outcomes (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.02; I²= 0%; 2 studies, 16,849 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Compared to placebo, GLP-1 receptor agonists may have little or no effect on the risk of severe hypoglycaemia (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.25; I² = 44%; 4 studies, 6,292 participants; low-certainty evidence). The effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists compared to standard care or other hypoglycaemic agents were uncertain. No studies evaluated treatment on risks of fatigue, life participation, amputation or fracture.
GLP-1 receptor agonists probably reduced all-cause death but may have little or no effect on cardiovascular death in people with CKD and diabetes. GLP-1 receptor agonists probably lower major cardiovascular events, probably have little or no effect on kidney failure and composite kidney outcomes, and may have little or no effect on the risk of severe hypoglycaemia in people with CKD and diabetes.","Chronic kidney disease (CKD) (a long-term condition where the kidneys do not work effectively) and diabetes (a lifelong condition that causes a person's blood sugar level to become too high) are chronic conditions that bring on many challenges for people, particularly when they have to manage both at the same time. Diabetes can accelerate the development of kidney disease and is the leading cause of kidney failure (a condition where the kidneys no longer function well enough to keep a person alive). GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1) are medicines that lower blood glucose levels and may also have beneficial effects on high blood pressure and obesity, and decrease the chances of death, heart attack, stroke and kidney failure (a condition where the kidneys no longer function well enough to keep a person alive).
We wanted to find out if GLP-1 improves diabetes control and kidney function, decreases heart-related complications such as heart attacks and stroke, and decreases the risk of kidney failure in people with both CKD and diabetes.
We searched for all trials that assessed the benefits and harms of GLP-1 for treating people with both CKD and diabetes. We compared GLP-1 with placebo (dummy medicine), usual care, and other glucose-lowering medicines (for example, insulin).
We included 42 studies that randomised 48,148 adults (18 years or older) with CKD and diabetes. None of the studies included children. The number of people ranged from 7 to 14,691, and the age ranged from 51 to 71 years. On average, the duration of the studies was six months. Twenty-one studies compared GLP-1 to placebo, 16 compared GLP-1 to a variety of glucose-lowering medicines, and five compared GLP-1 to standard care. Twenty-eight studies were multinational.
Compared to placebo, GLP-1 probably reduces the overall risk of dying due to any cause but may have little or no effect on the chances of dying from a heart-related problem. When major heart-related events were investigated together (death due to a heart attack, nonfatal heart attack and nonfatal stroke), GLP-1 probably reduces the risk of these combined events occurring. GLP-1 probably makes little or no difference to kidney failure and may make little or no difference to abnormally low blood glucose levels.
The effect of GLP-1 compared to usual care and other glucose-lowering medicines is unclear.
We are moderately confident that GLP-1 reduces the risk of dying due to any cause, reduces major heart-related events, and makes little or no difference to kidney failure. We are less confident in its effect on death from a heart-related problem or abnormally low blood sugar levels.

602b3ed14ae791260d6d12c5,finetuned_5,Renin angiotensin system inhibitors versus other types of medicine for hypertension,"This is the first update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2015. Renin angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors include angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and renin inhibitors. They are widely prescribed for treatment of hypertension, especially for people with diabetes because of postulated advantages for reducing diabetic nephropathy and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Despite widespread use for hypertension, the efficacy and safety of RAS inhibitors compared to other antihypertensive drug classes remains unclear. To evaluate the benefits and harms of first-line RAS inhibitors compared to other first-line antihypertensive drugs in people with hypertension. The Cochrane Hypertension Group Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to November 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. The searches had no language restrictions. We included randomized, active-controlled, double-blinded studies (RCTs) with at least six months follow-up in people with elevated blood pressure (? 130/85 mmHg), which compared first-line RAS inhibitors with other first-line antihypertensive drug classes and reported morbidity and mortality or blood pressure outcomes. We excluded people with proven secondary hypertension. Two authors independently selected the included trials, evaluated the risks of bias and entered the data for analysis. This update includes three new RCTs, totaling 45 in all, involving 66,625 participants, with a mean age of 66 years. Much of the evidence for our key outcomes is dominated by a small number of large RCTs at low risk for most sources of bias. Imbalances in the added second-line antihypertensive drugs in some of the studies were important enough for us to downgrade the quality of the evidence. Primary outcomes were all-cause death, fatal and non-fatal stroke, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), fatal and non-fatal congestive heart failure (CHF) requiring hospitalizations, total cardiovascular (CV) events (fatal and non-fatal stroke, fatal and non-fatal MI and fatal and non-fatal CHF requiring hospitalization), and end-stage renal failure (ESRF). Secondary outcomes were systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR). Compared with first-line calcium channel blockers (CCBs), we found moderate-certainty evidence that first-line RAS inhibitors decreased heart failure (HF) (35,143 participants in 5 RCTs, risk ratio (RR) 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77 to 0.90, absolute risk reduction (ARR) 1.2%), and that they increased stroke (34,673 participants in 4 RCTs, RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.32, absolute risk increase (ARI) 0.7%). Moderate-certainty evidence showed that first-line RAS inhibitors and first-line CCBs did not differ for all-cause death (35,226 participants in 5 RCTs, RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.09); total CV events (35,223 participants in 6 RCTs, RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.02); and total MI (35,043 participants in 5 RCTs, RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.09). Low-certainty evidence suggests they did not differ for ESRF (19,551 participants in 4 RCTs, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.05). Compared with first-line thiazides, we found moderate-certainty evidence that first-line RAS inhibitors increased HF (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.31, ARI 1.0%), and increased stroke (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.28, ARI 0.6%). Moderate-certainty evidence showed that first-line RAS inhibitors and first-line thiazides did not differ for all-cause death (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.07); total CV events (24,379 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 1.05, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.11); and total MI (24,379 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.01). Low-certainty evidence suggests they did not differ for ESRF (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.37). Compared with first-line beta-blockers, low-certainty evidence suggests that first-line RAS inhibitors decreased total CV events (9239 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.98, ARR 1.7%), and decreased stroke (9193 participants in 1 RCT, RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.88, ARR 1.7%). Low-certainty evidence suggests that first-line RAS inhibitors and first-line beta-blockers did not differ for all-cause death (9193 participants in 1 RCT, RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.01); HF (9193 participants in 1 RCT, RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.18); and total MI (9239 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.27). Blood pressure comparisons between first-line RAS inhibitors and other first-line classes showed either no differences or small differences that did not necessarily correlate with the differences in the morbidity outcomes. There is no information about non-fatal serious adverse events, as none of the trials reported this outcome. All-cause death is similar for first-line RAS inhibitors and first-line CCBs, thiazides and beta-blockers. There are, however, differences for some morbidity outcomes. First-line thiazides caused less HF and stroke than first-line RAS inhibitors. First-line CCBs increased HF but decreased stroke compared to first-line RAS inhibitors. The magnitude of the increase in HF exceeded the decrease in stroke. Low-quality evidence suggests that first-line RAS inhibitors reduced stroke and total CV events compared to first-line beta-blockers. The small differences in effect on blood pressure between the different classes of drugs did not correlate with the differences in the morbidity outcomes.","We determined how RAS (renin angiotensin system) inhibitors compared as first-line medicines for treating hypertension with other types of first-line medicines (thiazide diuretics, beta-blockers, CCBs, alpha-blockers, or central nervous system (CNS) active drugs) for hypertension. Hypertension is a long-lasting medical condition and associated with cardiovascular mortality and morbidity such as coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral vascular disease, which will reduce quality of life. RAS inhibitors have become a focus of interventions for hypertension in recent years and have been widely prescribed for treatment of hypertension. However, it remains unclear whether RAS inhibitors are superior to other antihypertensive drugs in terms of clinically relevant outcomes.
We searched for evidence up to November 2017. We included randomized, double-blind, parallel design RCTs for the present review. 45 trials with 66,625 participants who were followed-up for between 0.5 year and 5.6 years were included. The participants had an average age of 66 years. Overall, certainty of evidence was assessed as low to moderate according to the GRADE assessment. Moderate-certainty evidence demonstrated superiority of first-line thiazides to first-line RAS inhibitors in preventing heart failure and stroke. The certainty of evidence was assessed moderate for comparison between RAS inhibitors and CCBs. The certainty of evidence was low for comparison between RAS inhibitors and beta-blockers on total cardiovascular events and stroke since the results were based primarily on one large trial with moderate to high risk of bias.",1066,Renin angiotensin system inhibitors; diabetic nephropathy; cardiovascular morbidity; mortality; calcium channel blockers; heart failure; myocardial infarction; end-stage renal failure; thiazides; beta-blockers,What was the main focus of the Cochrane Review on RAS inhibitors?,Why are RAS inhibitors widely prescribed for people with hypertension?,Select all of the following that are fruits,"According to the review, how do thiazides compare to RAS inhibitors?",How is the overall quality of evidence described in the review?,To evaluate RAS inhibitors compared to other first-line antihypertensive drugs.; To study the cost-effectiveness of RAS inhibitors.; To compare the side effects of different antihypertensive drugs.,To evaluate RAS inhibitors compared to other first-line antihypertensive drugs.,They are believed to reduce diabetic nephropathy and cardiovascular issues.; They are the cheapest option available.; They have the fewest side effects.,They are believed to reduce diabetic nephropathy and cardiovascular issues.,dog; blue; grape,grape,Thiazides are superior in preventing heart failure and stroke.; Thiazides result in more side effects.; Thiazides are less effective in reducing blood pressure.,Thiazides are superior in preventing heart failure and stroke.,The overall quality of evidence is low to moderate.; The overall quality of evidence is high.; The overall quality of evidence is very low.,The overall quality of evidence is low to moderate.

GLP-1 regulates glucose levels by stimulating glucose-dependent insulin secretion and biosynthesis, and by suppressing glucagon secretion, delayed gastric emptying and promoting satiety.
To assess the effects of glucagon-like peptide analogues in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Studies were obtained from electronic searches of The Cochrane Library (last search issue 1, 2011), MEDLINE (last search March 2011), EMBASE (last search March 2011), Web of Science (last search March 2011) and databases of ongoing trials.
Studies were included if they were randomised controlled trials of a minimum duration of eight weeks comparing a GLP-1 analogue with placebo, insulin, an oral anti-diabetic agent, or another GLP-1 analogue in people with type 2 diabetes.
Data extraction and quality assessment of studies were done by one reviewer and checked by a second. Data were analysed by type of GLP-1 agonist and comparison treatment. Where appropriate, data were summarised in a meta-analysis (mean differences and risk ratios summarised using a random-effects model).
Seventeen randomised controlled trials including relevant analyses for 6899 participants were included in the analysis. Studies were mostly of short duration, usually 26 weeks. In comparison with placebo, all GLP-1 agonists reduced glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels by about 1%. Exenatide 2 mg once weekly and liraglutide 1.8 mg reduced it by 0.20% and 0.24% respectively more than insulin glargine. Exenatide 2 mg once weekly reduced HbA1c more than exenatide 10 ?g twice daily, sitagliptin and pioglitazone. Liraglutide 1.8 mg reduced HbA1c by 0.33% more than exenatide 10 ?g twice daily. Liraglutide led to similar improvements in HbA1c compared to sulphonylureas but reduced it more than sitagliptin and rosiglitazone. Both exenatide and liraglutide led to greater weight loss than most active comparators, including in participants not experiencing nausea. Hypoglycaemia occurred more frequently in participants taking concomitant sulphonylurea. GLP-1 agonists caused gastrointestinal adverse effects, mainly nausea. These adverse events were strongest at the beginning and then subsided. Beta-cell function was improved with GLP-1 agonists but the effect did not persist after cessation of treatment. None of the studies was long enough to assess long-term positive or negative effects.
GLP-1 agonists are effective in improving glycaemic control.","Glucagon-like peptide analogues or agonists are a new kind of drug in the treatment of type 2 diabetes that are given by injection under the skin. They regulate glucose levels by stimulating glucose-dependent insulin secretion and biosynthesis, and by suppressing glucagon secretion, delaying gastric emptying and promoting satiety. Various glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists are in use or in the licensing process, including exenatide, liraglutide, albiglutide, taspoglutide, lixisenatide and LY2189265.
Seventeen randomised controlled trials of mostly moderate to high quality randomised approximately 6899 people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Studies were mostly of short duration, usually 26 weeks. The longest duration study was 30 weeks. Of the seventeen studies, one compared albiglutide with placebo, two compared exenatide 10µg twice daily against exenatide 2 mg once weekly, one compared exenatide 2 mg once weekly against insulin glargine, one compared exenatide 2 mg once weekly against pioglitazone and sitagliptin, five compared liraglutide with placebo, two compared liraglutide with sulphonylurea, one each compared exenatide twice daily with liraglutide, liraglutide with sitagliptin, liraglutide with rosiglitazone and liraglutide with insulin glargine, two compared taspoglutide with placebo and one each compared lixisenatide with placebo and LY2189265 with placebo. In people already treated with oral anti-diabetes drugs, addition of glucagon-like peptide analogues improved blood sugar control in comparison to placebo, rosiglitazone, pioglitazone or sitagliptin, but not always in comparison to insulin (for exenatide) or glimepiride (a sulphonylurea). Glucagon-like peptide analogous caused more weight loss than any of the comparison treatments. However, more nausea and other gastrointestinal effects such as diarrhoea or vomiting were seen, though these tended to wear off and were not seen in all participants. There was slightly more hypoglycaemia with glucagon-like analogous than with placebo, but generally less than with other anti-diabetic treatments. The incidence of hypoglycaemia occurred more frequently in participants taking concomitant sulphonylurea. The studies were not long enough to assess long-term side effects. None of the studies investigated mortality or morbidity.",1006,"Glucagon-like peptide analogues, type 2 diabetes mellitus, glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), exenatide, liraglutide, insulin glargine, hypoglycaemia, gastrointestinal adverse effects, beta-cell function, sulphonylureas",What key factors led the researchers to choose glucagon-like peptide analogues as a focus for treating type 2 diabetes?,How do the results of GLP-1 agonists in comparison to placebo impact future diabetes treatment plans?,Select all of the following that are fruits,Which findings regarding side effects would most likely influence the long-term use of GLP-1 agonists?,What is the primary purpose of glucagon-like peptide analogues in the treatment of type 2 diabetes?,Their mechanism of stimulating glucose-dependent insulin secretion and suppressing glucagon secretion.; Their ability to replace insulin completely in diabetes management.; Their unique pathway of promoting satiety and delaying gastric emptying.,Their mechanism of stimulating glucose-dependent insulin secretion and suppressing glucagon secretion.; Their unique pathway of promoting satiety and delaying gastric emptying.,They ensure GLP-1 agonists will replace all other anti-diabetic medications.; They provide evidence supporting the inclusion of GLP-1 agonists in treatment regimens where weight loss is beneficial.; They suggest GLP-1 agonists are ineffective when used with placebo.,They provide evidence supporting the inclusion of GLP-1 agonists in treatment regimens where weight loss is beneficial.,dog; blue; grape,grape,The persistence of gastrointestinal effects like nausea and diarrhea.; The decrease in hypoglycemic events compared to sulphonylureas.; The studies' failure to address long-term side effects.,The decrease in hypoglycemic events compared to sulphonylureas.; The studies' failure to address long-term side effects.,To reduce blood glucose levels; To replace insulin therapy completely; To increase glucagon secretion,To reduce blood glucose levels
602b3ed14ae791260d6d12c5,finetuned_6,Treatment options for people with recurrent and progressive glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly malignant brain tumour that almost always progresses or recurs after standard first-line treatment, and there is no consensus on the most effective therapy once the disease returns. This review evaluated available treatments for first and later recurrence in people previously treated with the standard Stupp protocol and included a brief economic commentary. Searches of major medical databases up to December 2019 identified 42 eligible studies (34 randomised trials and 8 non-randomised studies) involving 5236 participants. Most randomised trials had low risk of bias, while non-randomised studies had high risk of bias. Treatments included chemotherapy, re-operation, re-irradiation, and novel therapies used alone or in combination. For first recurrence, 11 treatments contributed to the overall survival network analysis and eight to the progression-free survival analysis, with lomustine (LOM/CCNU) used as the reference treatment. No included studies in the network meta-analysis evaluated surgery, re-irradiation, PCV, temozolomide (TMZ) rechallenge, or best supportive care, and quality-of-life data were sparse. Median overall survival ranged from 5.5 to 12.6 months and median progression-free survival from 1.5 to 4.2 months. No high-certainty evidence showed any treatment improved survival compared with lomustine. Bevacizumab plus lomustine probably resulted in little or no difference in survival compared with lomustine alone, though it may improve progression-free survival. Bevacizumab alone may offer little or no survival benefit, and evidence remains uncertain. Regorafenib may improve overall survival compared with lomustine but evidence certainty was low. Temozolomide plus Depatux-M (ABT414) may improve survival compared with lomustine or bevacizumab, possibly driven by the temozolomide component, but additional evidence is needed. Fotemustine may have similar effects to lomustine. Evidence for bevacizumab plus irinotecan was very uncertain, and it likely offers little benefit over bevacizumab alone. Ranking analyses placed fotemustine first, followed by bevacizumab plus lomustine, lomustine alone, bevacizumab plus irinotecan, and bevacizumab alone, though ranking does not reflect evidence certainty. Three studies examining re-operation suggested it may extend survival in carefully selected patients. One early-phase study suggested a potential role for a cannabinoid plus temozolomide. Evidence for treatment of second or later recurrence was limited; some heterogeneous studies suggested radiotherapy with or without bevacizumab may improve survival, while tumour-treating fields showed little difference compared with physician's choice. No reliable evidence was found for best supportive care. Severe adverse events were significantly more common with bevacizumab plus lomustine than with lomustine alone and were similarly high with cediranib plus lomustine. Lomustine alone had the lowest rate of severe adverse events, followed by regorafenib. Combinations that added novel agents to bevacizumab generally increased toxicity. Overall, combination treatments for first recurrence did not improve survival compared with lomustine monotherapy and were often associated with more severe adverse events. Re-operation and re-irradiation may benefit selected individuals. Evidence for later recurrences remains sparse, and more high-quality research is needed.","Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a very aggressive brain tumour that often continues to grow even after surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, and almost always comes back. Many different treatments have been tested for tumour progression or recurrence, but there is no agreement on which option is best. This review evaluated treatments for people whose GBM progressed or recurred after receiving standard initial care. A total of 42 studies involving 5236 people were included. Treatments examined included chemotherapy, re-operation, re-irradiation, and newer therapies used alone or in combination. For first recurrence, none of the treatments showed clear evidence of being better than lomustine (CCNU). Adding bevacizumab to lomustine did not improve overall survival, and most other agents either had uncertain benefits or did not improve outcomes. Several commonly used treatments such as PCV and temozolomide re-challenge were not represented in the available evidence. Limited evidence suggested that a second surgery, with or without additional therapies, may offer some survival benefit in selected individuals. For second or later recurrence, evidence was too limited for statistical analysis, but radiotherapy with or without bevacizumab might offer some benefit, though this is uncertain. Serious side effects occurred with many treatments, and combining bevacizumab with lomustine resulted in more severe adverse events than lomustine alone. Overall, lomustine appears to be the most effective chemotherapy option for first recurrence, and other combination therapies generally carried higher risks without clear benefits. A second surgery or radiotherapy may be helpful for some individuals. For later recurrences, evidence is sparse and uncertain. More research is needed, especially for commonly used treatments not evaluated in the included studies.",1022,Glioblastoma; Stupp protocol; lomustine; progression-free survival; overall survival; bevacizumab; temozolomide; Fotemustine; re-irradiation; severe adverse events,In what ways do the reviewed treatments reflect the challenges in managing GBM recurrences?,What was the main purpose of the study?,Select all of the following that are colors,Which treatment appeared most effective for first recurrence of GBM?,Describe how combination therapies for GBM first recurrence impacted outcomes.,Lack of treatments with clear survival benefits; Abundance of high-certainty evidence; Uniformity in patient response to treatments,Lack of treatments with clear survival benefits,To establish a new treatment protocol for GBM.; To evaluate treatments for GBM recurrence.; To prove the effectiveness of surgery for GBM.,To evaluate treatments for GBM recurrence.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Bevacizumab plus lomustine.; Lomustine alone.; Regorafenib.,Lomustine alone.,Combination therapies improved overall survival.; Combination therapies often increased severe adverse events.; Combination therapies provided clear benefits over lomustine.,Combination therapies often increased severe adverse events.

To assess the effects of AGI in people with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), impaired fasting blood glucose (IFG), moderately elevated glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) or any combination of these.
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and the reference lists of systematic reviews, articles and health technology assessment reports. The date of the last search of all databases was December 2017.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), with a duration of one year or more, comparing AGI with any pharmacological glucose-lowering intervention, behaviour-changing intervention, placebo or no intervention in people with IFG, IGT, moderately elevated HbA1c or combinations of these.
Two review authors read all abstracts and full-text articles or records, assessed quality and extracted outcome data independently. One review author extracted data, which were checked by a second review author. We resolved discrepancies by consensus or involvement of a third review author. For meta-analyses we used a random-effects model with assessment of risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes, using 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for effect estimates. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence by using the GRADE instrument.
For this update of the Cochrane Review (first published 2006, Issue 4) we included 10 RCTs (11,814 participants), eight investigating acarbose and two investigating voglibose, that included people with IGT or people ""at increased risk for diabetes"". The trial duration ranged from one to six years. Most trials compared AGI with placebo (N = 4) or no intervention (N = 4). Acarbose reduced the incidence of T2DM compared to placebo: 670 out of 4014 people (16.7%) in the acarbose groups developed T2DM, compared to 812 out of 3994 people (20.3%) in the placebo groups (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.89; P < 0.0001; 3 trials; 8008 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). One trial including participants with coronary heart disease and IGT contributed 64% of cases for this outcome. Acarbose reduced the risk of T2DM compared to no intervention: 7 out 75 people (9.3%) in the acarbose groups developed T2DM, compared to 18 out of 65 people (27.7%) in the no-intervention groups (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.69; P = 0.004; 2 trials; 140 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Acarbose compared to placebo did not reduce or increase the risk of all-cause mortality (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.18; P = 0.86; 3 trials; 8069 participants; very low-certainty evidence), cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.71 to 1.10; P = 0.26; 3 trials; 8069 participants; very low-certainty evidence), serious adverse events (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.29; P = 0.13; 2 trials; 6625 participants; low-certainty evidence), non-fatal stroke (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.74; P = 0.43; 1 trial; 1368 participants; very low-certainty evidence) or congestive heart failure (RR of 0.87; 95% CI 0.63 to 1.12; P = 0.40; 2 trials; 7890 participants; low-certainty evidence). Acarbose compared to placebo reduced non-fatal myocardial infarction: one out of 742 participants (0.1%) in the acarbose groups had a non-fatal myocardial infarction compared to 15 out of 744 participants (2%) in the placebo groups (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.53; P = 0.007; 2 trials; 1486 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Acarbose treatment showed an increased risk of non-serious adverse events (mainly gastro-intestinal events), compared to placebo: 751 of 775 people (96.9%) in the acarbose groups experienced an event, compared to 723 of 775 people (93.3%) in the placebo groups (RR 1.04; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.06; P = 0.0008; 2 trials; 1550 participants). Acarbose compared to no intervention showed no advantage or disadvantage for any of these outcome measures (very low-certainty evidence). One trial each compared voglibose with placebo (1780 participants) or diet and exercise (870 participants). Voglibose compared to placebo reduced the incidence of T2DM: 50 out of 897 participants (5.6%) developed T2DM, compared to 106 out of 881 participants (12%) in the placebo group (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.64; P < 0.0001; 1 trial; 1778 participants; low-certainty evidence). For all other reported outcome measures there were no clear differences between voglibose and comparator groups. One trial with 90 participants compared acarbose with diet and exercise and another trial with 98 participants reported data on acarbose versus metformin. There were no clear differences for any outcome measure between these two acarbose interventions and the associated comparator groups. None of the trials reported amputation of lower extremity, blindness or severe vision loss, end-stage renal disease, health-related quality of life, time to progression to T2DM, or socioeconomic effects.
AGI may prevent or delay the development of T2DM in people with IGT. There is no firm evidence that AGI have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular mortality or cardiovascular events.","People with moderately elevated glucose levels are often said to be at an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Therefore, these people are frequently recommended to increase exercise and lower calorie intake to prevent type 2 diabetes. Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (acarbose, miglitol, voglibose) are used to lower blood glucose in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is currently not known whether alpha-glucosidase inhibitors should be prescribed for people with moderately raised blood glucose levels. We wanted to find out whether alpha-glucosidase inhibitors could prevent or delay type 2 diabetes mellitus in people with moderately elevated glucose levels. We searched medical literature for randomised controlled trials of at least one year's duration investigating alpha-glucosidase inhibitors in participants with glucose levels higher than considered normal but below the diagnostic criteria for type 2 diabetes mellitus. We found 10 randomised controlled trials representing 11,814 participants: eight investigating acarbose and two investigating voglibose. The trial duration ranged from one to six years. When comparing acarbose with placebo, 670 out of 4014 participants (17%) receiving acarbose developed type 2 diabetes compared to 812 out of 3994 participants (20%) receiving placebo. Most data for this comparison came from a trial including people with heart disease. When comparing acarbose with no intervention, seven out of 75 participants (9%) receiving acarbose developed type 2 diabetes compared to 18 out of 65 participants (28%) receiving no intervention. Acarbose treatment did not reduce or increase the risk of death from any cause, death from heart disease, serious side effects, strokes or heart failure. Compared to placebo, acarbose reduced the risk for heart attacks: one out of 742 participants (0.1%) receiving acarbose had a heart attack compared to 15 out of 744 participants (2%) receiving placebo. Acarbose treatment showed an increased risk of non-serious side effects (mainly gastrointestinal events): 751 of 775 people (97%) receiving acarbose had a non-serious side effect compared to 723 of 775 people (93%) receiving placebo. One trial compared voglibose with placebo and another compared voglibose with diet and exercise. When comparing voglibose with placebo, 50 out of 897 participants (5.6%) receiving voglibose developed type 2 diabetes compared to 106 out of 881 participants (12%) receiving placebo. One trial with 90 participants compared acarbose with diet and exercise and another with 98 participants compared acarbose with metformin; there were no important differences for any outcome. None of the trials reported amputation of lower limbs, blindness or severe vision loss, kidney disease, health-related quality of life, time to progression to type 2 diabetes mellitus, or socioeconomic effects such as absence from work or costs. For most of our outcomes we are uncertain or very uncertain how valid the results are. Reasons for this uncertainty include systematic errors in some trials, the low number of trials for several outcomes, imprecise results, and missing data from one included trial.",1012,Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors; type 2 diabetes mellitus; impaired glucose tolerance; impaired fasting blood glucose; glycosylated haemoglobin A1c; acarbose; voglibose; all-cause mortality; non-fatal myocardial infarction; non-serious adverse events,What is the primary goal of using alpha-glucosidase inhibitors in people with moderately elevated glucose levels?,Which alpha-glucosidase inhibitors were investigated in the study?,Select all of the following that are colors,How many randomised controlled trials were included in the study?,Which group showed a lower incidence of type 2 diabetes when comparing acarbose with placebo?,To prevent or delay type 2 diabetes mellitus; To increase physical exercise levels; To reduce calorie intake,To prevent or delay type 2 diabetes mellitus,Acarbose and voglibose; Metformin and voglibose; Miglitol and acarbose,Acarbose and voglibose,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,10 trials; 6 trials; 12 trials,10 trials,Acarbose group; Placebo group; Control group,Acarbose group
6110888158573651261c3100,static_2,What are the benefits and risks of using steroids for treating nephrotic syndrome in children?,"In nephrotic syndrome, protein leaks from the blood into the urine through the glomeruli, resulting in hypoproteinaemia and generalised oedema. While most children with nephrotic syndrome respond to corticosteroids, 80% experience a relapsing course. Corticosteroids have reduced the death rate to around 3%; however, corticosteroids have well-recognised potentially serious adverse events such as obesity, poor growth, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, cataracts, glaucoma and behavioural disturbances. This is an update of a review first published in 2000 and updated in 2002, 2005, 2007, 2015 and 2020. The aim of this review was to assess the benefits and harms of different corticosteroid regimens in children with steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SSNS). The benefits and harms of therapy were studied in two groups of children: 1) children in their initial episode of SSNS and 2) children who experience a relapsing course of SSNS. We contacted the Information Specialist and searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 9 July 2024 using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) performed in children (one to 18 years) during their initial or subsequent episode of SSNS, comparing different durations, total doses or other dose strategies using any corticosteroid agent. Summary estimates of effects were obtained using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. In this 2024 update, we included five new studies, resulting in 54 studies randomising 4670 children. Risk of bias methodology was often poorly performed, with only 31 studies and 28 studies respectively assessed to be at low risk for random sequence generation and allocation concealment. Ten studies were at low risk of performance bias (blinding of participants and personnel), and 12 studies were at low risk of detection bias (blinding of outcome assessment); nine of these studies were placebo-controlled RCTs. Twenty-seven studies (fewer than 50%) were at low risk for attrition bias, and 26 studies were at low risk for reporting bias (selective outcome reporting). In studies at low risk of selection bias evaluating children in their initial episode of SSNS, there is little or no difference in the number of children with frequent relapses when comparing two months of prednisone with three months or more (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.10; 755 children, 5 studies; I2= 0%; high certainty evidence) or when comparing three months with five to seven months of therapy (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.33; 376 children, 3 studies; I2= 35%; high certainty evidence). In analyses of studies at low risk of selection bias, there is little or no difference in the number of children with any relapse by 12 to 24 months when comparing two months of prednisone with three months or more (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.06; 808 children; 6 studies; I2= 47%) or when comparing three months with five to seven months of therapy (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.11; 377 children, 3 studies; I2= 53%). Little or no difference was noted in adverse events between the different treatment durations. Amongst children with relapsing SSNS, four small studies (177 children) utilising lower doses of prednisone compared with standard regimens found little or no differences between groups in the numbers with relapse (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.20; I2= 0%). A fifth study (117 children) reported little or no difference between two weeks and four weeks of alternate-day prednisone after remission with daily prednisone. A recent large, well-designed study with 271 children found that administering daily prednisone compared with alternate-day prednisone or no prednisone during viral infection did not reduce the risk of relapse. In contrast, four previous small studies in children with frequently relapsing disease had reported that daily prednisone during viral infections compared with alternate-day prednisone or no treatment reduced the risk of relapse. There are four well-designed studies randomising 823 children, which have demonstrated that there is no benefit of prolonging prednisone therapy beyond two to three months in the first episode of SSNS. Small studies in children with relapsing disease have identified no differences in efficacy using lower induction doses or shorter durations of prednisone therapy. Large, well-designed studies are required to confirm these findings. While previous small studies had suggested that changing from alternate-day to daily prednisone therapy at the onset of infection reduced the likelihood of relapse, a much larger and well-designed study found no reduction in the number relapsing when administering daily prednisone at the onset of infection.","Nephrotic syndrome is a condition in which the kidneys leak protein from the blood into the urine, and if left untreated, children can develop serious infections. In most children, this protein leak stops with steroid treatment because steroids are strong anti-inflammatory medicines, but they can also cause significant side effects such as depression, anxiety, high blood pressure, cataracts, increased infection risk, weight gain, and slowed growth. Children may also experience repeated episodes of nephrotic syndrome, often triggered by viral infections. We wanted to determine the best treatment options for children with nephrotic syndrome to stop protein leakage while avoiding harmful steroid side effects. We searched for all studies that compared the benefits and risks of different steroid regimens in children experiencing nephrotic syndrome for the first time or in those with frequent repeat episodes. We identified 54 studies involving 4670 children from around the world, many from South Asia. Twenty-three studies compared shorter courses of prednisone lasting two to three months with longer courses lasting three to seven months in children experiencing their first episode. The remaining studies looked at children with frequent relapses. We found that longer courses of prednisone (three to seven months) did not meaningfully reduce the chance of a child experiencing another episode or becoming someone who has frequent repeat episodes, compared with shorter two- to three-month courses. The side effects appeared similar between shorter and longer treatments, although many studies did not report this information clearly. Overall, the evidence shows that children experiencing nephrotic syndrome for the first time only need two to three months of prednisone because extending treatment does not lower the risk of relapses. However, we are less confident regarding side effects since many studies did not provide enough usable information.",1085,nephrotic syndrome; hypoproteinaemia; oedema; corticosteroids; steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome; prednisone; glomeruli; alternate-day prednisone; frequently relapsing; remission,Name a motivation for the study according to the plain-language summary.,State a key finding regarding the duration of prednisone treatment.,Select the items that are animals,Explain the goal of reviewing different steroid regimens.,Paraphrase the study's conclusion on treatment duration.,To find the most effective steroid regimens; To determine if steroid therapy is outdated; To evaluate new surgical techniques,To find the most effective steroid regimens,Longer courses reduce the chance of episodes; Shorter courses are as effective as longer courses; Only intravenous doses are effective,Shorter courses are as effective as longer courses,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,To balance efficacy and side effects; To eliminate steroid usage entirely; To improve patient dietary plans,To balance efficacy and side effects,Extending treatment beyond two to three months is unnecessary; Seven-month treatments are significantly better; All patients benefit most from indefinite treatment,Extending treatment beyond two to three months is unnecessary
6110888158573651261c3100,static_2,How accurate are alternative laboratory-based molecular tests (to RT-PCR with prior RNA extraction/purification) for identifying people infected by SARS-CoV-2?,"Diagnosing people with a SARS-CoV-2 infection played a critical role in managing the COVID-19 pandemic and remains a priority for the transition to long-term management of COVID-19. Initial shortages of extraction and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) reagents impaired the desired upscaling of testing in many countries, which led to the search for alternatives to RNA extraction/purification and RT-PCR testing. Reference standard methods for diagnosing the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection rely primarily on real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Alternatives to RT-PCR could, if sufficiently accurate, have a positive impact by expanding the range of diagnostic tools available for the timely identification of people infected by SARS-CoV-2, access to testing and the use of resources. We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of alternative (to RT-PCR assays) laboratory-based molecular tests for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection. We searched the COVID-19 Open Access Project living evidence database from the University of Bern until 30 September 2020 and the WHO COVID-19 Research Database until 31 October 2022, with no language restrictions. We included studies of people with suspected or known SARS-CoV-2 infection, or where tests were used to screen for infection, and studies evaluating commercially developed laboratory-based molecular tests for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection considered as alternatives to RT-PCR testing, and we included all reference standards to define the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2, including RT-PCR tests and established clinical diagnostic criteria. Two authors independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and applicability using the QUADAS-2 tool. We presented sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals for each test using paired forest plots and summarised results using average sensitivity and specificity with a bivariate random-effects meta-analysis, illustrating the findings per index test category and assay brand compared to the WHO's acceptable sensitivity and specificity thresholds for nucleic acid tests. We included data from 64 studies reporting 94 cohorts of participants and 105 index test evaluations, with 74,753 samples and 7517 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases. We did not identify any published or preprint reports of accuracy for a considerable number of commercially produced NAAT assays. Most cohorts were judged at unclear or high risk of bias in more than three QUADAS-2 domains; around half were at high risk of selection bias because of recruitment based on COVID status; and three quarters were at high risk of bias in the reference standard domain due to reliance on a single RT-PCR result or unclear diagnostic timing, missing results, or absent participant flow diagrams. For test categories with four or more evaluations allowing summary estimates, RT-PCR assays designed to omit/adapt RNA extraction/purification had average sensitivity of 95.1% (95% CI 91.1% to 97.3%) and specificity of 99.7% (95% CI 98.5% to 99.9%; 27 evaluations, 2834 samples and 1178 cases); RT-LAMP assays had average sensitivity of 88.4% (95% CI 83.1% to 92.2%) and specificity of 99.7% (95% CI 98.7% to 99.9%; 24 evaluations, 29,496 samples and 2255 cases); TMA assays had average sensitivity of 97.6% (95% CI 95.2% to 98.8%) and specificity of 99.4% (95% CI 94.9% to 99.9%; 14 evaluations, 2196 samples and 942 cases); digital PCR assays had average sensitivity of 98.5% (95% CI 95.2% to 99.5%) and specificity of 91.4% (95% CI 60.4% to 98.7%; 5 evaluations, 703 samples and 354 cases); RT-LAMP assays omitting/adapting RNA extraction had average sensitivity of 73.1% (95% CI 58.4% to 84%) and specificity of 100% (95% CI 98% to 100%; 24 evaluations, 14,342 samples and 1502 cases). Only two index categories fulfilled WHO-acceptable requirements: RT-PCR assays designed to omit/adapt RNA extraction/purification and TMA assays. At 5% prevalence in a cohort of 1000 people, the positive predictive value of RT-PCR assays omitting/adapting extraction is 94%, with three false positives among 51 positive results and about two missed cases; for TMA assays, positive predictive value is 89%, with six false positives among 55 positive results and around one missed case. Alternative laboratory-based molecular tests aim to enhance testing capacity by reducing time, steps, and resource requirements. Several technologies with potential advantages have not been evaluated or were assessed by few low-quality studies, so performance remains undetermined. Only RT-PCR assays designed to omit/adapt RNA extraction/purification and TMA assays fulfil WHO accuracy standards and may be suitable alternatives when RT-PCR is inaccessible. However, findings must be interpreted with caution due to limitations, including reliance on retrospective samples without symptom information, dominant representation of specific high-performing brands (21/26 and 12/14 studies), and methodological weaknesses. Although we used comprehensive searches and broad inclusion criteria, further research is needed to evaluate alternative COVID-19 tests and their role in pandemic management.","Laboratory-based molecular assays (tests) aim to confirm or rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection in people. Alternatives to RT-PCR assays have been developed to minimise the steps needed to process samples in the laboratory or use fewer resources to obtain the same valid results. For this review, we focus on tests commercially developed by a manufacturer, providing instructions for their professional use. People with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection should know if they are infected to self-isolate, receive treatment, and inform close contacts. Failure to detect SARS-CoV-2 when it is present risks spreading infection and results in missed opportunities for prevention. Diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection when it is not present may lead to unnecessary self-isolation and testing of close contacts. Currently, testing to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection relies on a laboratory molecular test called RT-PCR. This requires specialist equipment and can take 24 hours to produce a result. If assays that take less time or use readily available resources were sufficiently accurate to replace RT-PCR testing, this could increase the number of tests that could be done, allow faster diagnosis and enable people to take appropriate action more quickly. We wanted to know whether commercially developed, alternative laboratory-based molecular tests are accurate enough to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to RT-PCR. We looked for studies investigating these tests in people (or samples) that were also tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection using RT-PCR which modified RT-PCR by removing or altering components of this testing process. We included 105 evaluations evaluating alternatives to RT-PCR in the review. The main results are based on 74,753 samples, and SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed in 7517 of these samples. Most evaluations (27/105) concerned various test types specifically designed to omit/adapt RNA extraction/purification. Twenty-four of 105 evaluations concerned various test types operating at one temperature (isothermal tests) rather than cycling through different temperatures. Twenty-four of 105 evaluations were concerned with various test types that combined these two alternative approaches. Only tests specifically designed to omit/adapt RNA extraction/purification and TMA assays with RNA extraction (a type of isothermal test) met WHO-acceptable standards for confirming and ruling out SARS-CoV-2. For illustration, the results of these studies indicate that in a group of 1000 people, 50 of whom (5%) actually have SARS-CoV-2: for tests specifically designed to omit/adapt RNA extraction/purification, 51 people would test positive for SARS-CoV-2, of these, three people (6%) would not have SARS-CoV-2 (false-positive result), and 949 people would test negative for SARS-CoV-2, of these, two people (0.2%) would actually have SARS-CoV-2 (false-negative result); for TMA tests with RNA extraction, 55 people would test positive for SARS-CoV-2, of these, six people (10%) would not have SARS-CoV-2 (false-positive result), and 945 people would test negative for SARS-CoV-2, of these, one person (0.1%) would actually have SARS-CoV-2 (false-negative result). Most included studies did not provide information on participants who underwent testing, such as whether they had symptoms or were close contacts of a SARS-CoV-2 case. We also had concerns about the method of recruiting participants for the majority of included studies, which may have resulted in an overestimation of the accuracy of these methods. In addition, the method used to determine whether individuals did not have SARS-CoV-2 infection was not considered reliable for most studies, which may have resulted in underestimating the accuracy of these methods. Some studies did not follow the manufacturers' instructions for using the test. Results from different test brands using the same technique varied. The studies included in this review suggest that two laboratory-based molecular tests might be accurate enough to replace or supplement RT-PCR tests with prior RNA extraction/purification for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection: RT-PCR tests developed to omit or adapt RNA extraction or purification and TMA isothermal tests (retaining an RNA extraction step). Other alternative tests to RT-PCR were assessed just by a few studies of limited methodological quality, and their performance should be evaluated by additional studies. Furthermore, data in these studies mostly relied on samples acquired in the past (compared to current or future samples), thus further evaluation of these tests in real clinical practice scenarios is required. Also, decisions on the optimal test for a specific setting will be driven not only by diagnostic accuracy, but also by other factors such as test complexity, time to result, acceptability to those being tested, and the setting in which the tests are to be used.",1112,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6110888158573651261c3100,interactive_3,What are the benefits and risks of vaccines for preventing COVID-19?,"Different forms of vaccines have been developed to prevent the SARS-CoV-2 virus and subsequent COVID-19 disease, and several are in widespread global use. The objective was to assess the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines, whether as a full primary series or booster dose, against SARS-CoV-2. We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and the COVID-19 LOVE platform (last search 5 November 2021), as well as the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, regulatory agency websites, and Retraction Watch. We included randomized controlled trials comparing COVID-19 vaccines with placebo, no vaccine, other active vaccines, or other vaccine schedules. Using standard Cochrane methods and GRADE for all outcomes except immunogenicity, we synthesized data for each vaccine separately and presented summary effect estimates with 95% confidence intervals. We included 41 RCTs assessing 12 vaccines, including homologous and heterologous schedules and booster doses; 32 were multicentre and five were multinational, with sample sizes ranging from 60 to 44,325 participants. Participants were aged 18 years or older in 36 RCTs, 12 years or older in one, 12 to 17 years in two, and three to 17 years in two; 29 trials included people over 60, three included immunocompromized patients, and none included pregnant women. Follow-up was ? two months in 16 RCTs, two to six months in 20, and > six to 12 months in five; 18 were preplanned interim analyses. Overall risk of bias was low for all outcomes in eight RCTs, while 33 had concerns for at least one outcome. We identified 343 registered RCTs with unavailable results. This abstract reports results for symptomatic COVID-19, severe/critical COVID-19, and serious adverse events for the 10 WHO-approved vaccines. Evidence for mortality was sparse and low or very low certainty for all vaccines except AD26.COV2.S (Janssen), which probably reduces all-cause mortality (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.67; 1 RCT, 43,783 participants; high-certainty evidence). High-certainty evidence shows that BNT162b2 (Pfizer), mRNA-1273 (Moderna), ChAdOx1 (AstraZeneca), Ad26.COV2.S, BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm-Beijing), and BBV152 (Bharat Biotech) reduce symptomatic COVID-19 compared with placebo, with vaccine efficacy ranging from about 66% to over 97% based on multiple trials. Moderate-certainty evidence shows that NVX-CoV2373 (Novavax) probably reduces symptomatic infection, while CoronaVac (Sinovac) has low-certainty evidence due to heterogeneity between its two trials. For severe or critical COVID-19, high-certainty evidence indicates that BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, Ad26.COV2.S, and BBV152 produce large reductions in severe disease, with efficacy estimates ranging from about 76% to over 98%; NVX-CoV2373 probably reduces severe disease; and two CoronaVac trials reported high efficacy but could not be pooled. For serious adverse events, mRNA-1273, ChAdOx1/SII-ChAdOx1, Ad26.COV2.S, and BBV152 probably result in little or no difference compared with placebo (RRs ranging from 0.65 to 0.92), with absolute differences fewer than 5 per 1000 participants. Evidence for SAEs is uncertain for BNT162b2, CoronaVac, BBIBP-CorV, and NVX-CoV2373 due to wide confidence intervals and low event counts. For heterologous schedules, boosters, and variant-specific efficacy, see the full review. Compared with placebo, most vaccines reduce or likely reduce symptomatic COVID-19, and several show high-certainty reductions in severe or critical disease, with probably little or no difference in serious adverse events. Over 300 registered RCTs continue to evaluate COVID-19 vaccines, and this review is regularly updated on the COVID-NMA platform. Due to trial exclusions, results cannot be generalized to pregnant women, individuals with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, or immunocompromized people; most trials had short follow-up and occurred before variants of concern emerged. Future research should evaluate long-term effects, compare vaccines and schedules, assess efficacy and safety in specific populations, include outcomes such as preventing long COVID-19, and continually monitor protection against emerging variants.","SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) is the virus that causes COVID-19 disease, and not everyone infected will develop symptoms, which can range from mild (such as fever and headaches) to life-threatening (such as difficulty breathing), or death. While vaccines work slightly differently, they all prepare the body's immune system to prevent people from getting infected with SARS-CoV-2 or, if they do get infected, to prevent severe disease. We wanted to find out how well each vaccine works in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection, symptomatic COVID-19, severe COVID-19 disease, and total deaths (including any cause), as well as serious adverse events requiring hospitalization or being life-threatening, systemic reactogenicity events (short-term immunological reactions like fever, headache, body aches, and fatigue), and any adverse events including non-serious ones. We searched for studies examining any COVID-19 vaccine compared with placebo, no vaccine, or another COVID-19 vaccine, selecting only randomized trials that evaluate interventions under ideal conditions among participants assigned by chance to different groups, and we summarized results and rated our confidence in the evidence based on study conduct. We found 41 worldwide studies involving 433,838 people assessing 12 vaccines; 35 included only healthy people who had never had COVID-19, 36 included only adults, two only adolescents, two children and adolescents, and one adolescents and adults; three involved people with weakened immune systems, and none involved pregnant women. Most studies assessed results less than six months after primary vaccination, most received co-funding from academic institutions and pharmaceutical companies, most compared a COVID-19 vaccine with placebo, and five evaluated a 'mix and match' booster. We report results for three main outcomes and for 10 WHO-approved vaccines: there is insufficient evidence regarding deaths between vaccines and placebo except for the Janssen vaccine, which probably reduces all-cause deaths. The Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Sinopharm-Beijing, and Bharat vaccines produce a large reduction in symptomatic COVID-19, Janssen reduces symptomatic cases, Novavax probably produces a large reduction, and CoronaVac has insufficient evidence because results differed between its two studies. For severe disease, Pfizer, Moderna, Janssen, and Bharat produce a large reduction, while evidence for CoronaVac is insufficient due to differing study results. For serious adverse events, Pfizer, CoronaVac, Sinopharm-Beijing, and Novavax have insufficient evidence due to low numbers of events, while Moderna, AstraZeneca, Janssen, and Bharat probably result in no or little difference in serious adverse events. Most studies assessed vaccines for a short time after injection, making it unclear how protection wanes over time; exclusion criteria limit generalizability to pregnant women, people with prior infection, and those with weakened immune systems; more research is needed comparing vaccines, schedules, effectiveness, and safety in specific populations and outcomes such as preventing long COVID-19; and most studies were conducted before variants of concern emerged.",1110,COVID-19 vaccines; placebo; vaccine efficacy; homologous schedules; heterologous schedules; booster doses; symptomatic COVID-19; severe/critical COVID-19; serious adverse events; variants of concern,What are the implications of the short follow-up period noted in many studies regarding vaccine efficacy?,How could future research be designed to improve understanding of vaccine performance against emerging variants?,Select the items that are animals,What reasoning supports the conclusion that most vaccines probably reduce severe COVID-19 disease?,"How did the results of CoronaVac differ between the two trials, and why is this significant?",Long-term effectiveness might be underestimated due to short follow-up.; Short follow-up guarantees accurate assessment of immediate adverse events.; It provides a comprehensive view of vaccine efficacy against emerging variants.,Long-term effectiveness might be underestimated due to short follow-up.,Incorporating diverse geographic regions where variants are spreading rapidly.; Limiting studies to specific age groups already well-researched in past studies.; Extending the study duration to capture changes in variant prevalence.,Incorporating diverse geographic regions where variants are spreading rapidly.; Extending the study duration to capture changes in variant prevalence.,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,High-certainty evidence from multiple trials demonstrating efficacy in severe disease prevention.; Uniform efficacy rates observed across all studied vaccines.; Consistent reduction in hospitalization rates in the vaccinated groups.,High-certainty evidence from multiple trials demonstrating efficacy in severe disease prevention.; Consistent reduction in hospitalization rates in the vaccinated groups.,"The trials demonstrated contradictory efficacy results, complicating overall interpretation.; Both trials showed identical efficacy against severe COVID-19.; The results highlighted a varying immune response across different populations.","The trials demonstrated contradictory efficacy results, complicating overall interpretation.; The results highlighted a varying immune response across different populations."
6110888158573651261c3100,interactive_4,Do education programmes improve outcomes in people with both chronic kidney disease and diabetes?,"Adherence to complex regimens for people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes is often poor. Interventions to enhance adherence require intensive education and behavioural counselling. However, whether the existing evidence is scientifically rigorous and can support recommendations for routine use of educational programmes in people with CKD and diabetes is still unknown. This is an update of a review first published in 2011.
To evaluate the benefits and harms of education programmes for people with CKD and diabetes. We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 19 July 2024 using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs investigating the benefits and harms of educational programmes (information and behavioural instructions and advice given by a healthcare provider, who could be a nurse, pharmacist, educator, health professional, medical practitioner, or healthcare provider, through verbal, written, audio-recording, or computer-aided modalities) for people 18 years and older with CKD and diabetes.
Two authors independently screened the literature, determined study eligibility, assessed quality, and extracted and entered data. We expressed dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and continuous data as mean difference (MD) with 95% CI. Data were pooled using the random-effects model. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Eight studies (13 reports, 840 randomised participants) were included. The overall risk of bias was low for objective outcomes and attrition bias, unclear for selection bias, reporting bias and other biases, and high for subjective outcomes. Education programmes compared to routine care alone probably decrease glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) (4 studies, 467 participants: MD -0.42%, 95% CI -0.53 to -0.31; moderate certainty evidence; 13.5 months follow-up) and may decrease total cholesterol (179 participants: MD -0.35 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.63 to -00.07; low certainty evidence) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (179 participants: MD -0.40 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.65 to -0.14; low certainty evidence) at 18 months of follow-up. One study (83 participants) reported education programmes for people receiving dialysis who have diabetes may improve the diabetes knowledge of diagnosis, monitoring, hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia, medication with insulin, oral medication, personal health habits, diet, exercise, chronic complications, and living with diabetes and coping with stress (all low certainty evidence). There may be an improvement in the general knowledge of diabetes at the end of the intervention and at the end of the three-month follow-up (one study, 97 participants; low certainty evidence) in people with diabetes and moderately increased albuminuria (A2). In participants with diabetes and moderately increased albuminuria (A2) (one study, 97 participants), education programmes may improve a participantÃÆÃÆÃâÃÂ¢ÃÆÃâÃâÃâ¬ÃÆÃâÃâÃâ¢s beliefs in treatment effectiveness and total self-efficacy at the end of five weeks compared to routine care (low certainty evidence). Self-efficacy for in-home blood glucose monitoring and beliefs in personal control may increase at the end of the three-month follow-up (low certainty evidence). There were no differences in other self-efficacy measures. One study (100 participants) reported an education programme may increase change in behaviour for general diet, specific diet and home blood glucose monitoring at the end of treatment (low certainty evidence); however, at the end of three months of follow-up, there may be no difference in any behaviour change outcomes (all low certainty evidence). There were uncertain effects on death, serious hypoglycaemia, and kidney failure due to very low certainty evidence. No data was available for changes in kidney function (creatinine clearance, serum creatinine, doubling of serum creatinine or proteinuria). For an education programme plus multidisciplinary, co-ordinated care compared to routine care, there may be little or no difference in HbA1c, kidney failure, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), systolic or diastolic blood pressure, hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia, and LDL and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (all low certainty evidence in participants with type-2 diabetes mellitus and documented advanced diabetic nephropathy). There were no data for death, patient-orientated measures, change in kidney function (other than eGFR and albuminuria), cardiovascular disease morbidity, quality of life, or adverse events. Education programmes may improve knowledge of some areas related to diabetes care and some self-management practices. Education programmes probably decrease HbA1c in people with CKD and diabetes, but the effect on other clinical outcomes is unclear. This review only included eight studies with small sample sizes. Therefore, more randomised studies are needed to examine the efficacy of education programmes on important clinical outcomes in people with CKD and diabetes.","Chronic kidney disease (a long-term condition where the kidneys do not work effectively) and diabetes (a lifelong condition that causes a person's blood sugar level to become too high) are chronic conditions that bring on many challenges for people, particularly when they have to manage both at the same time. Diabetes can accelerate the development of kidney disease and is the leading cause of kidney failure (a condition where the kidneys no longer function well enough to keep a person alive). While sticking to complex treatment plans can be challenging, successful self-management in the early stages of kidney disease can improve outcomes later in life and delay the need for dialysis or a kidney transplant. Education programmes are any set of planned activities designed to improve a person's ability to manage their condition and delay the progression of their kidney disease. These activities can aim to improve a person's knowledge of their disease, self-care activities, and their ability to self-monitor the disease, thus encouraging and motivating them to create healthy lifestyle changes, improve their treatment compliance, and improve quality of life. We wanted to find out whether an education programme designed for people with both kidney disease and diabetes helps them understand their condition and recognise the importance of strategies aimed at slowing its progression and preventing long-term complications. We searched for randomised studies (studies in which participants are assigned randomly to two or more treatment groups) that compared education programmes to usual care for people with both kidney disease and diabetes. We compared and summarised the results and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and sizes.
We included eight studies involving 840 people 18 years or older with both kidney disease and diabetes. Four studies were undertaken in multiple centres, and four studies were performed in single centres. The duration of follow-up ranged from 12 weeks to four years. Most of the education programmes were designed to increase a person's knowledge of their condition and improve self-management behaviours. One study focused on reducing stress using mindfulness (a person's ability to be aware of where they are and what they are doing), and it was adapted to include practices for complex thoughts and feelings related to diabetes, and one study used a co-ordinated medical care approach with multiple practitioners involved in a person's care. Overall, education programmes probably lower blood glucose levels and may lower total cholesterol and blood pressure, but may make little or no difference to kidney function, abnormally low or high blood sugar, and cardiovascular disease (disorders of the heart and blood vessels). For people with diabetes on dialysis (a procedure to remove waste products and excess fluid from the blood when the kidneys stop working properly), an education programme may improve their knowledge of diabetes, self-management behaviour for checking their feet, using lotion, wearing appropriate shoes and socks, and coping with stress. For people with moderately increased protein in the urine, there may be an improvement in their general knowledge of diabetes, their confidence in monitoring their blood sugar levels at home, their beliefs in their personal control, as well as behavioural changes to their diet. There may be no behavioural changes to exercise, foot care, or quitting smoking.
We have low confidence in education programmes improving the understanding of diabetes in people with kidney disease. This is because the number of studies reporting outcomes of interest was low, and the education programmes varied, so we were unable to properly analyse the results.",1082,Chronic kidney disease; HbA1c; Low-density lipoprotein; Moderately increased albuminuria; Education programmes; Multi-disciplinary coordinated care; Estimated glomerular filtration rate; Hyperglycaemia; Diabetic nephropathy; Self-efficacy,Which factors may influence the validity of the education programme outcomes in the study?,What criteria were used to determine the study's confidence in the evidence of educational programme outcomes?,Select all of the following that are fruits,Evaluate the potential limitations of the study's findings on education programmes.,What effect do education programmes have on self-monitoring practices?,Variability in programme design and delivery.; Limited participant age range.; Inconsistent follow-up durations.,Variability in programme design and delivery.; Inconsistent follow-up durations.,Study methods and sizes.; Geographic diversity of centres.; Participant demographics.,Study methods and sizes.,dog; blue; grape,grape,Limited number of studies and participants.; Inconsistent reporting of follow-up data.; Variety in educational programme approaches.,Limited number of studies and participants.; Variety in educational programme approaches.,They may improve confidence in home blood sugar monitoring.; They may decrease interest in self-monitoring.; They significantly improve kidney function.,They may improve confidence in home blood sugar monitoring.
6110888158573651261c3100,interactive_4,What are the benefits and risks of inhaled bronchodilators in preterm newborns for preventing and treating lung disease?,"Chronic lung disease (CLD) occurs frequently in preterm infants and is associated with respiratory morbidity. Bronchodilators have the potential effect of dilating small airways with muscle hypertrophy. Increased compliance and tidal volume, and decreased airway resistance, have been documented with the use of bronchodilators in infants with CLD. Therefore, bronchodilators are widely considered to have a role in the prevention and treatment of CLD, but there remains uncertainty as to whether they improve clinical outcomes. This is an update of the 2016 Cochrane review. To determine the effect of inhaled bronchodilators given as prophylaxis or as treatment for chronic lung disease (CLD) on mortality and other complications of preterm birth in infants at risk for or identified as having CLD. An Information Specialist searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and three trials registers from 2016 to May 2023. In addition, the review authors undertook reference checking, citation searching and contact with trial authors to identify additional studies. We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials involving preterm infants less than 32 weeks old that compared bronchodilators to no intervention or placebo. CLD was defined as oxygen dependency at 28 days of life or at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age. Initiation of bronchodilator therapy for the prevention of CLD had to occur within two weeks of birth. Treatment of infants with CLD had to be initiated before discharge from the neonatal unit. The intervention had to include administration of a bronchodilator by nebulisation or metered dose inhaler. The comparator was no intervention or placebo. We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Critical outcomes included: mortality within the trial period; CLD (defined as oxygen dependency at 28 days of life or at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age); adverse effects of bronchodilators, including hypokalaemia (low potassium levels in the blood), tachycardia, cardiac arrhythmia, tremor, hypertension and hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar); and pneumothorax. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. We included two randomised controlled trials in this review update. Only one trial provided useable outcome data. This trial was conducted in six neonatal intensive care units in France and Portugal, and involved 173 participants with a gestational age of less than 31 weeks. The infants in the intervention group received salbutamol for the prevention of CLD. The evidence suggests that salbutamol may result in little to no difference in mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50 to 2.31; risk difference (RD) 0.01, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.11; low-certainty evidence) or CLD at 28 days (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.37; RD 0.02, 95% CI -0.13 to 0.17; low-certainty evidence), when compared to placebo. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of salbutamol on pneumothorax. The one trial with usable data reported that there were no relevant differences between groups, without providing the number of events (very low-certainty evidence). Investigators in this study did not report if side effects occurred. We found no eligible trials that evaluated the use of bronchodilator therapy for the treatment of infants with CLD. We identified no ongoing studies. Low-certainty evidence from one trial showed that inhaled bronchodilator prophylaxis may result in little or no difference in the incidence of mortality or CLD in preterm infants, when compared to placebo. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of salbutamol on pneumothorax, and neither included study reported on the incidence of serious adverse effects. We identified no trials that studied the use of bronchodilator therapy for the treatment of CLD. Additional clinical trials are necessary to assess the role of bronchodilator agents in the prophylaxis or treatment of CLD. Researchers studying the effects of inhaled bronchodilators in preterm infants should include relevant clinical outcomes in addition to pulmonary mechanical outcomes.","Newborns born too early, especially those born before 28 weeks of pregnancy, face a higher risk of death, lung disease, and brain impairment than babies born at or near term, and some develop long-term problems such as intellectual disabilities, blindness, or deafness. Chronic lung disease is common among preterm infants who cannot breathe independently and require oxygen or mechanical ventilation. Bronchodilators are medicines that widen the air passages in the lungs and may help open small airways in preterm babies; they are used to treat or potentially prevent chronic lung disease. These medicines can be inhaled, taken by mouth, injected, or delivered through a nebuliser, but they may cause side effects such as low potassium levels, fast or abnormal heart rhythms, tremor, high blood pressure, high sugar levels, or lung collapse. We wanted to find out whether bronchodilators reduce the risk of death or chronic lung disease and whether they increase the risk of unwanted effects, including abnormal heart rhythms, tremor, high blood pressure, high sugar levels, or pneumothorax (collapsed lung). We searched for studies evaluating bronchodilators in preterm infants and summarised the findings, rating our confidence in the evidence based on study design and sample size. Only two studies met the criteria, and one did not report any relevant outcomes. The remaining study involved 173 preterm newborns at risk of chronic lung disease who were treated with salbutamol or placebo. Salbutamol may make little to no difference to the risk of death or chronic lung disease compared with placebo, and its effect on pneumothorax is unclear; in this study it was given at a dose of 200 micrograms every four hours for 28 days. The study did not report any adverse effects of salbutamol, and there are no ongoing studies investigating bronchodilator use in preterm infants.

6110888158573651261c3100,finetuned_5,Immunosuppressive treatment for focal segmental glomerulosclerosis in adults,"Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) can result from primary, genetic, or secondary causes; primary disease typically leads to nephrotic syndrome, while genetic and secondary forms may present with asymptomatic proteinuria or with nephrotic syndrome. Only about 20% of patients achieve partial or complete remission with treatment, and roughly half progress to kidney failure. This updated review assessed treatments for adults with FSGS and included 15 studies with 560 participants, all of whom had steroid-resistant disease since no trials evaluated corticosteroids versus placebo despite guidelines recommending steroids as first-line therapy. Five studies compared cyclosporin, with or without prednisone, to various treatments including no specific therapy, prednisone, methylprednisolone, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and dexamethasone. Other small single trials evaluated monoclonal antibodies such as adalimumab and fresolimumab, rituximab versus tacrolimus, cyclosporin plus valsartan versus cyclosporin alone, MMF versus prednisone, chlorambucil with steroids versus no treatment, different dexamethasone regimens, CCX140-B versus placebo, and one larger study compared sparsentan to irbesartan. Evidence for cyclosporin suggested it may increase the likelihood of complete remission and of combined complete or partial remission, though results were imprecise and based on few small trials. Cyclosporin showed little to no difference in preventing chronic kidney disease progression or kidney failure, and its effects on hypertension or infection remained uncertain. MMF appeared to offer little or no difference compared to prednisone for remission outcomes or kidney function, and most other interventions had very low certainty evidence, preventing firm conclusions. It is also uncertain whether sparsentan reduces proteinuria more effectively than irbesartan. Overall, no trials evaluated the recommended first-line therapy of corticosteroids, and the available evidence applies only to steroid-resistant FSGS. Cyclosporin may improve remission rates when given for at least six months, but confidence in these findings is limited by the small size and variability of the studies. Future trials must more clearly define patient populations distinguishing primary, genetic, and secondary FSGS to support stronger treatment recommendations.","Nephrotic syndrome is a condition where the kidneys leak protein from the blood into the urine. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) defined on kidney biopsy is an uncommon cause of nephrotic syndrome disease but it progresses to kidney failure in about half of all cases. It can be divided into three groups - primary FSGS (thought to be due to a factor circulating in the blood that damages the kidneys), genetic (secondary to mutations in one or more genes), and secondary to other causes, including certain infections. Treatments aim to reduce the amount of protein in the urine completely or partly to increase the time before kidney failure develops.
We looked at all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which examined therapy with prednisone or other agents which affect the immune system such as cyclosporin and mycophenolate mofetil and other agents with or without steroid therapy. We found 15 studies involving 553 participants. In five studies cyclosporin was compared with different treatments. Combining four studies (231 participants) showed that cyclosporin was more effective than these other treatments in achieving complete remission of nephrotic syndrome. The studies were too small and lasted for too short a time to determine if cyclosporin reduced the risk of kidney failure. Nine small studies examined different medicines that suppress the body's immune system. None of these treatments reduced the amount of protein in the urine.
We found limited information that cyclosporin may reduce the amount of protein in the urine in some people with FSGS but the data are uncertain because the studies enrolled too few participants.

6110888158573651261c3100,finetuned_6,Aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for the prevention of dementia,"Dementia is a worldwide concern. Its global prevalence is increasing. At present, there is no medication licensed to prevent or delay the onset of dementia. Inflammation has been suggested as a key factor in dementia pathogenesis. Therefore, medications with anti-inflammatory properties could be beneficial for dementia prevention. To evaluate the effectiveness and adverse effects of aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for the primary or secondary prevention of dementia. We searched ALOIS, the specialised register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group up to 9 January 2020. ALOIS contains records of clinical trials identified from monthly searches of several major healthcare databases, trial registries and grey literature sources. We ran additional searches across MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP) and six other databases to ensure that the searches were as comprehensive and up-to-date as possible. We also reviewed citations of reference lists of included studies. We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) comparing aspirin or other NSAIDs with placebo for the primary or secondary prevention of dementia. We included trials with cognitively healthy participants (primary prevention) or participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or cognitive complaints (secondary prevention). We used standard methodological procedures according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We rated the strength of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach. We included four RCTs with 23,187 participants. Because of the diversity of these trials, we did not combine data to give summary estimates, but presented a narrative description of the evidence. We identified one trial (19,114 participants) comparing low-dose aspirin (100 mg once daily) to placebo. Participants were aged 70 years or older with no history of dementia, cardiovascular disease or physical disability. Interim analysis indicated no significant treatment effect and the trial was terminated slightly early after a median of 4.7 years' follow-up. There was no evidence of a difference in incidence of dementia between aspirin and placebo groups (risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.15; high-certainty evidence). Participants allocated aspirin had higher rates of major bleeding (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.60, high-certainty evidence) and slightly higher mortality (RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.28; high-certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in activities of daily living between groups (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.02; high-certainty evidence). We identified three trials comparing non-aspirin NSAIDs to placebo. All three trials were terminated early due to adverse events associated with NSAIDs reported in other trials. One trial (2528 participants) investigated the cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor celecoxib (200 mg twice daily) and the non-selective NSAID naproxen (220 mg twice daily) for preventing dementia in cognitively healthy older adults with a family history of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Median follow-up was 734 days. Combining both NSAID treatment arms, there was no evidence of a difference in the incidence of AD between participants allocated NSAIDs and those allocated placebo (RR 1.91, 95% CI 0.89 to 4.10; moderate-certainty evidence). There was also no evidence of a difference in rates of myocardial infarction (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.61 to 2.40), stroke (RR 1.82, 95% CI 0.76 to 4.37) or mortality (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.43) between treatment groups (all moderate-certainty evidence). One trial (88 participants) assessed the effectiveness of celecoxib (200 mg or 400 mg daily) in delaying cognitive decline in participants aged 40 to 81 years with mild age-related memory loss but normal memory performance scores. Mean duration of follow-up was 17.6 months in the celecoxib group and 18.1 months in the placebo group. There was no evidence of a difference between groups in test scores in any of six cognitive domains. Participants allocated celecoxib experienced more gastrointestinal adverse events than those allocated placebo (RR 2.66, 95% CI 1.05 to 6.75; low-certainty evidence). One trial (1457 participants) assessed the effectiveness of the COX-2 inhibitor rofecoxib (25 mg once daily) in delaying or preventing a diagnosis of AD in participants with MCI. Median duration of study participation was 115 weeks in the rofecoxib group and 130 weeks in the placebo group. There was a higher incidence of AD in the rofecoxib than the placebo group (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.72; moderate-certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between groups in cardiovascular adverse events (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.66; moderate-certainty evidence) or mortality (RR 1.62, 95% CI 0.85 to 3.05; moderate-certainty evidence). Participants allocated rofecoxib had more upper gastrointestinal adverse events (RR 3.53, 95% CI 1.17 to 10.68; moderate-certainty evidence). Reported annual mean difference scores showed no evidence of a difference between groups in activities of daily living (year 1: no data available; year 2: 0.0, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.2; year 3: 0.1, 95% CI - 0.1 to 0.3; year 4: 0.1, 95% CI -0.1 to 0.4; moderate-certainty evidence). There is no evidence to support the use of low-dose aspirin or other NSAIDs of any class (celecoxib, rofecoxib or naproxen) for the prevention of dementia, but there was evidence of harm. Although there were limitations in the available evidence, it seems unlikely that there is any need for further trials of low-dose aspirin for dementia prevention. If future studies of NSAIDs for dementia prevention are planned, they will need to be cognisant of the safety concerns arising from the existing studies.","Dementia is a worldwide healthcare concern. At present, there is no medicine that is proven to delay or prevent the onset of dementia. The biology of dementia is still poorly understood. However, there are reasons to believe that inflammation may be partly responsible for some of the brain changes seen in dementia. There are many medicines that have anti-inflammatory properties, including aspirin and NSAIDs that are often sold as pain killers. We wanted to see if these medicines had any effect on developing dementia. These medicines have a few potential side effects, including heart attack and bleeding, so we also assessed for any harmful effects of the medicines. We searched for relevant studies that had been published up to January 2020. We found four trials that met the inclusion criteria for this review (23,187 people). One trial was undertaken in the USA and Australia and three in the USA only. The trials included different populations. One was of aspirin in healthy people with no history of dementia, cardiovascular disease or physical disability. The other three were of NSAIDs other than aspirin and were conducted in healthy people with a family history of Alzheimer's disease, people with self-reported memory loss and people with mild cognitive impairment (a slight but noticeable and measurable decline in cognitive abilities, including memory and thinking skills). All of the included studies had limitations. The study of aspirin was stopped early due to ineffectiveness. The three studies of other NSAIDs (celecoxib, naproxen and rofecoxib) were stopped early due to concerns around the safety. This review found no evidence to support the use of either aspirin or other NSAIDs for the prevention of dementia and, in fact, there was some suggestion that they may cause harm. The studies had limitations, but, given the concerns over safety, further studies of low-dose aspirin for dementia prevention seem unlikely. If future studies of NSAIDs for dementia prevention are planned, then these will need to be mindful of the safety concerns arising from the studies included in this review and from other studies of the same medicines.",1132,Dementia; inflammation; anti-inflammatory properties; non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); primary prevention; secondary prevention; cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor; celecoxib; naproxen; rofecoxib,What could be the implications of the study's findings on future research into dementia prevention utilizing NSAIDs?,In what ways do the limitations of these studies influence the perceived strength of the evidence regarding NSAIDs' effectiveness in dementia prevention?,Select all of the following that are colors,Identify the primary goal of the study regarding these medications.,Summarize the main finding of the aspirin study in relation to dementia prevention.,Future studies will likely focus on alternative anti-inflammatory agents.; The safety concerns highlighted will necessitate the development of safer NSAID formulations.; There will be an increased interest in combining NSAIDs with other treatments to enhance effectiveness.,Future studies will likely focus on alternative anti-inflammatory agents.; The safety concerns highlighted will necessitate the development of safer NSAID formulations.,The limitations significantly weaken the evidence's reliability.; The limitations bolster confidence in the studies' findings.; The limitations necessitate a nuanced interpretation of the results.,The limitations significantly weaken the evidence's reliability.; The limitations necessitate a nuanced interpretation of the results.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,To observe their effectiveness in delaying or preventing dementia; To cure existing cases of dementia; To discover new side effects,To observe their effectiveness in delaying or preventing dementia,No evidence was found to support the use of aspirin for dementia prevention.; Aspirin was found to effectively prevent dementia.; Aspirin increased the risk of developing dementia.,No evidence was found to support the use of aspirin for dementia prevention.
6110888158573651261c3100,finetuned_6,Interventions to prevent or reduce kidney complications in people with sickle cell disease,"Sickle cell disease (SCD), one of the commonest severe monogenic disorders, is caused by the inheritance of two abnormal haemoglobin (beta-globin) genes. SCD can cause severe pain, significant end-organ damage, pulmonary complications, and premature death. Kidney disease is a frequent and potentially severe complication in people with SCD. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined as abnormalities of kidney structure or function present for more than three months. Sickle cell nephropathy refers to the spectrum of kidney complications in SCD. Glomerular damage is a cause of microalbuminuria and can develop at an early age in children with SCD, with increased prevalence in adulthood. In people with sickle cell nephropathy, outcomes are poor as a result of the progression to proteinuria and chronic kidney insufficiency. Up to 12% of people who develop sickle cell nephropathy will develop end-stage renal disease. This is an update of a review first published in 2017. To assess the effectiveness of any intervention for preventing or reducing kidney complications or chronic kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease. Possible interventions include red blood cell transfusions, hydroxyurea, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), either alone or in combination. We searched for relevant trials in the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, seven other databases, and two other trials registers. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing interventions to prevent or reduce kidney complications or CKD in people with SCD. We applied no restrictions related to outcomes examined, language, or publication status. Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility, extracted data, assessed the risk of bias, and assessed the certainty of the evidence (GRADE). We included three RCTs with 385 participants. We rated the certainty of the evidence as low to very low across different outcomes according to GRADE methodology, downgrading for risk of bias concerns, indirectness, and imprecision. Hydroxyurea versus placebo One RCT published in 2011 compared hydroxyurea to placebo in 193 children aged nine to 18 months. We are unsure if hydroxyurea compared to placebo reduces or prevents progression of kidney disease assessed by change in glomerular filtration rate (mean difference (MD) 0.58 mL/min /1.73 m2, 95% confidence interval (CI) -14.60 to 15.76; 142 participants; very low certainty). Hydroxyurea compared to placebo may improve the ability to concentrate urine (MD 42.23 mOsm/kg, 95% CI 12.14 to 72.32; 178 participants; low certainty), and may make little or no difference to SCD-related serious adverse events, including acute chest syndrome (risk ratio (RR) 0.39, 99% CI 0.13 to 1.16; 193 participants; low certainty), painful crisis (RR 0.68, 99% CI 0.45 to 1.02; 193 participants; low certainty); and hospitalisations (RR 0.83, 99% CI 0.68 to 1.01; 193 participants; low certainty). No deaths occurred in either trial arm and the RCT did not report quality of life. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors versus placebo One RCT published in 1998 compared an ACEI (captopril) to placebo in 22 adults with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. We are unsure if captopril compared to placebo reduces proteinuria (MD -124.10 to 26.10; 22 participants; very low certainty). We are unsure if captopril reduces or prevents kidney disease as measured by creatinine clearance; the trial authors stated that creatinine clearance remained constant over six months in both groups, but provided no comparative data (very low certainty). The RCT did not report serious adverse events, all-cause mortality, or quality of life. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors versus vitamin C One RCT published in 2020 compared an ACEI (lisinopril)with vitamin C in 170 children aged one to 18 years with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. It reported no data we could analyse. We are unsure if lisinopril compared to vitamin C reduces proteinuria in this population: the large drop in microalbuminuria in both arms of the trial after only one month on treatment may have been due to an overestimation of microalbuminuria at baseline rather than a true effect. The RCT did not report serious adverse events, all-cause mortality, or quality of life. We are unsure if hydroxyurea improves glomerular filtration rate or reduces hyperfiltration in children aged nine to 18 months, but it may improve their ability to concentrate urine and may make little or no difference to the incidence of acute chest syndrome, painful crises, and hospitalisations. We are unsure if ACEI compared to placebo has any effect on preventing or reducing kidney complications in adults with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. We are unsure if ACEI compared to vitamin C has any effect on preventing or reducing kidney complications in children with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. No RCTs assessed red blood cell transfusions or any combined interventions to prevent or reduce kidney complications. Due to lack of evidence, we cannot comment on the management of children aged over 18 months or adults with any known genotype of SCD. We have identified a lack of adequately designed and powered studies, although we found four ongoing trials since the last version of this review. Only one ongoing trial addresses renal function as a primary outcome in the short term, but such interventions have long-term effects. Trials of hydroxyurea, ACEIs or red blood cell transfusion in older children and adults are urgently needed to determine any effect on prevention or reduction of kidney complications in people with SCD.","SCD is a serious inherited blood disorder where the red blood cells, which carry oxygen around the body, develop abnormally. Normal red blood cells are flexible and disc-shaped, but sickled cells are rigid and crescent-shaped, and stickier than normal red blood cells. This can lead to blockage of blood vessels, resulting in tissue and organ damage and episodes of severe pain. The abnormal cells are fragile and break apart easily, which leads to a decreased number of red blood cells, known as anaemia.Kidney complications can start at an early age in children with SCD and are common in adults with the condition. Kidney complications leading to kidney protein leak and chronic kidney disease can be severe, with serious effects on health. Severe complications include the need for dialysis (a procedure to remove waste products and excess fluid from the blood when the kidneys stop working properly) or a kidney transplant. Identifying therapies that can prevent or slow down the decline in kidney function in people with SCD is critical for improving health outcomes. The evidence is current to 22 September 2022. We found three randomised controlled trials, which enroled a total of 385 people. One trial, published in 2011, compared the drug hydroxyurea (which helps to maintain the shape and flexibility of red blood cells), to placebo (dummy treatment) in 193 children aged nine to 18 months. The second trial, published in 1998, compared captopril (a drug used to treat high blood pressure) to placebo in 22 adults with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria (high levels of protein in the urine). The third trial, published in 2020, compared lisinopril (a drug used to treat high blood pressure) to vitamin C in 170 children aged one to 18 years. Two trials received government funding; it was unclear how the third trial was funded. We have little or very little confidence in the evidence because we only found three trials, and they had specific populations (only children or only adults), few participants, and wide variations in results.",1089,Sickle cell disease; monogenic disorders; haemoglobin; chronic kidney disease; sickle cell nephropathy; microalbuminuria; end-stage renal disease; glomerular filtration rate; acute chest syndrome; painful crisis,What condition does sickle cell disease primarily affect?,Identify a key characteristic of red blood cells in people with SCD.,Select the items that are animals,What is the main purpose of the reviewed trials in the study?,What serious kidney complication can arise from SCD?,Red blood cells; White blood cells; Blood platelets,Red blood cells,Flexible and disc-shaped; Rigid and crescent-shaped; Irregular and square-shaped,Rigid and crescent-shaped,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,To prevent kidney protein leak; To slow kidney function decline; To cure SCD,To slow kidney function decline,Kidney stones; Need for dialysis or kidney transplant; Urinary tract infections,Need for dialysis or kidney transplant
644bc265cb8a19eab3311bab,static_1,Biosimilar monoclonal antibodies for cancer treatment in adults,"Biosimilars are products that contain an approved biological medicine and are similar, but not identical, to the original version (the originator). In cancer, biosimilars have been developed from the monoclonal antibodies bevacizumab, rituximab, and trastuzumab, and they are now available for treating lung, colorectal, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and breast cancers. Because biological products cannot be made identically, it is important to evaluate the clinical effects of biosimilars compared with their originators to understand their benefits and harms. We evaluated the benefits and harms of biosimilar monoclonal antibodies versus their originators in adults with cancer. We searched major medical and clinical trial databases up to February 2024 for randomized controlled trials comparing biosimilars to originators. Standard Cochrane methods were used. The primary outcomes were progression-free survival, duration of response, overall survival, pathological complete response in breast cancer, serious adverse events, and health-related quality of life. We included 55 studies with 22,046 adults: 23 studies of bevacizumab involving 10,639 participants with colorectal or lung cancer, 17 studies of rituximab involving 4412 participants with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 15 studies of trastuzumab involving 6995 participants with breast cancer. Studies took place worldwide, were mostly multicentre, and all were funded by manufacturers. Participants ranged in age from 47 to 62 years, and the percentage of women ranged from 18% to 100%. Fifteen studies used non-inferiority designs and 40 used equivalence designs. Overall risk of bias was low, with most concerns related to incomplete outcome data and selective reporting. For bevacizumab in lung or colorectal cancer, progression-free survival was likely similar between biosimilars and originators, with equal numbers per 1000 at 12 months and a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.00. Duration of response and overall survival were also likely similar, and serious adverse events showed no important differences. Health-related quality of life was evaluated in only one colorectal cancer study and results were similar. Objective response and mortality were likely similar as well. For rituximab in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, biosimilars were likely similar to originators for progression-free survival, duration of response, overall survival, serious adverse events, objective response, and mortality. No studies reported quality of life. For trastuzumab in breast cancer, biosimilars were likely similar to originators for progression-free survival, duration of response, overall survival, serious adverse events, and objective response, and may be similar for pathological complete response. No studies reported quality of life. Across bevacizumab, rituximab, and trastuzumab, biosimilars were generally similar to their originators in progression-free survival, duration of response, overall survival, serious adverse events, objective response, and mortality. Evidence for pathological complete response (trastuzumab) and quality of life (bevacizumab) was limited. Overall, evidence certainty was moderate, with imprecision being the main reason for downgrading confidence.","Biological medicines used in cancer treatment are made from living organisms and work by killing cancer cells. Biosimilars are medicines that are similar to the original biological medicine, known as the originator. Although biosimilars have slightly different structures, they target cancer cells in the same way. Originator medicines, sometimes called reference or innovator medicines, receive approval before biosimilars. Unlike generic medicines, which are chemically derived and easier to replicate, originators and biosimilars are biological medicines, making it more difficult to create identical copies. However, biosimilars are often cheaper and could improve access to effective cancer treatment if they provide similar benefits and harms. We wanted to compare the benefits and harms of bevacizumab, rituximab, and trastuzumab biosimilars with their originators. Based on the input from five people with cancer, we considered several outcomes critical for clinical decisions: the length of time cancer does not grow or spread after treatment, the length of time people remain cancer-free, overall survival, the number of people whose breast cancer disappears in tissue removed during surgery, severe unwanted effects, and well-being. We also identified outcomes important for decision-making: the number of people whose cancer shrinks or disappears, death, and the time until cancer grows or spreads or until death. We searched for studies comparing biosimilars of bevacizumab, rituximab, or trastuzumab with the originators in people with lung, colorectal, non-Hodkin's lymphoma, and breast cancers, summarized the results, and rated our confidence in the evidence. We found 55 studies with 22,046 participants, including 10,639 receiving bevacizumab for advanced or metastatic lung cancer, 4412 receiving rituximab mainly for non-Hodkin's lymphoma, and 6995 receiving trastuzumab for advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Participants were 47 to 62 years old on average, and the studies took place across Asia, Europe, and North and South America. All studies were funded by the companies manufacturing the biosimilars. Receiving biosimilars or originator medicines led to similar results overall, and we are moderately confident that biosimilars are as effective as the originators in treating cancer. We set narrow criteria to judge whether results were sufficiently similar, and while most comparisons did not fall fully within this range, overall findings still support similarity. Most studies were well conducted, but a few may have allowed participants to know which treatment they received, and some studies did not report all outcomes of interest.",1018,biosilimars; biological medicine; bevacizumab; rituximab; trastuzumab; progression-free survival; duration of response; overall survival; serious adverse events; health-related quality of life,In what way do biosimilars demonstrate their therapeutic value compared to originators?,How could a decision-maker justify the use of biosimilars in cancer treatment?,Select all of the following that are colors,Name the three monoclonal antibodies mentioned that have biosimilars.,Describe the types of cancer involved in the studies comparing biosimilars and originators.,By showing adequately similar outcomes in critical measures for decision-making.; By providing completely different benefits that improve treatment options.; By achieving perfect replication of all outcomes observed with originators.,By showing adequately similar outcomes in critical measures for decision-making.,By arguing that biosimilars provide a moderate increase in life expectancy.; By highlighting their overall similar effectiveness and lower cost.; By pointing to their identical molecular composition to originators.,By highlighting their overall similar effectiveness and lower cost.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Bevacizumab; Rituximab; Trastuzumab,Bevacizumab; Rituximab; Trastuzumab,"Lung, colorectal, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and breast cancers.; Prostate and skin cancers.; Bone and stomach cancers.","Lung, colorectal, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and breast cancers."
644bc265cb8a19eab3311bab,static_2,Does random drug and alcohol testing prevent injuries in workers?,"Drug- and alcohol-related impairment in the workplace has been linked to an increased risk of injury for workers. Randomly testing populations of workers for these substances has become a practice in many jurisdictions, with the intention of reducing the risk of workplace incidents and accidents. Despite the proliferation of random drug and alcohol testing (RDAT), there is currently a lack of consensus about whether it is effective at preventing workplace injury, or improving other non-injury accident outcomes in the work place.
To assess the effectiveness of workplace RDAT to prevent injuries and improve non-injury accident outcomes (unplanned events that result in damage or loss of property) in workers compared with no workplace RDAT.
We conducted a systematic literature search to identify eligible published and unpublished studies. The date of the last search was 1 November 2020. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, two other databases, Google Scholar, and three trials registers. We also screened the reference lists of relevant publications known to us.
Study designs that were eligible for inclusion in our review included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-randomised trials (CRTs), interrupted time-series (ITS) studies, and controlled before-after (CBA) studies. Studies needed to evaluate the effectiveness of RDAT in preventing workplace injury or improving other non-injury workplace outcomes. We also considered unpublished data from clinical trial registries. We included employees working in all safety-sensitive occupations, except for commercial drivers, who are the subject of another Cochrane Review.
Independently, two review authors used a data collection form to extract relevant characteristics from the included study. They then analysed a line graph included in the study of the prevalence rate of alcohol violations per year. Independently, the review authors completed a GRADE assessment, as a means of rating the quality of the evidence.
Although our searching originally identified 4198 unique hits, only one study was eligible for inclusion in this review. This was an ITS study that measured the effect of random alcohol testing (RAT) on the test positivity rate of employees of major airlines in the USA from 1995 to 2002. The study included data from 511,745 random alcohol tests, and reported no information about testing for other substances. The rate of positive results was the only outcome of interest reported by the study. The average rate of positive results found by RAT increased from 0.07% to 0.11% when the minimum percentage of workers who underwent RAT annually was reduced from 25% to 10%. Our analyses found this change to be a statistically significant increase (estimated change in level, where the level reflects the average percentage points of positive tests = 0.040, 95% confidence interval 0.005 to 0.075; P = 0.031). Our GRADE assessment, for the observed effect of lower minimum testing percentages associating with a higher rate of positive test results, found the quality of the evidence to be 'very low' across the five GRADE domains. The one included study did not address the following outcomes of interest: fatal injuries; non-fatal injuries; non-injury accidents; absenteeism; and adverse effects associated with RDAT.
In the aviation industry in the USA, the only setting for which the eligible study reported data, there was a statistically significant increase in the rate of positive RAT results following a reduction in the percentage of workers tested, which we deem to be clinically relevant. This result suggests an inverse relationship between the proportion of positive test results and the rate of testing, which is consistent with a deterrent effect for testing. No data were reported on adverse effects related to RDAT. We could not draw definitive conclusions regarding the effectiveness of RDAT for employees in safety-sensitive occupations (not including commercial driving), or with safety-sensitive job functions. We identified only one eligible study that reflected one industry in one country, was of non-randomised design, and tested only for alcohol, not for drugs or other substances. Our GRADE assessment resulted in a 'very low' rating for the quality of the evidence on the only outcome reported. The paucity of eligible research was a major limitation in our review, and additional studies evaluating the effect of RDAT on safety outcomes are needed.","Workplace accidents and injuries happen more often when people's physical abilities and judgement are impaired by drugs or alcohol. The workplace is not usually a place where research is conducted. There are many factors that make it difficult for an employer to measure the impact of a workplace drug testing program on the overarching goal of ensuring a safe workplace. Some employers particularly in sectors where safety is very important, such as the commercial driving and airline industries choose to test workers randomly for drugs and alcohol (random drug and alcohol testing (RDAT)). Through such testing, employers hope to deter employees from inappropriate use of these substances. However, we do not know if RDAT produces the desired effect. We wanted to know whether RDAT in the workplace prevents injuries and unplanned events that result in damage or loss of property (non-injury accidents) compared with no RDAT. We wanted to include all of the relevant research about RDAT in the workplace in our review. We looked for different kinds of published studies that measured how RDAT affected workplace safety. We excluded research on RDAT in commercial drivers, because another Cochrane Review covering these studies has already been published. Two authors from our team examined all of the references identified by our search, but they found only one study that met our selection criteria and could be included in the review. This study investigated random alcohol testing in airline employees in the USA whose jobs included safety-related tasks. The study did not test employees for drugs. Airlines are required by law to test and report on a randomly selected sample of their employees. The study used testing data from between 1995 and 2002. A total of 511,745 random alcohol tests were performed on airline employees. From 1995 to 1997, random tests for alcohol included 25% of the relevant airlines' workforce each year. During this period, the average percentage of employees who tested positive for alcohol was 0.07%. From 1998 to 2002, the proportion of the workforce tested each year dropped to 10%. During this period, the average percentage of employees who tested positive for alcohol increased to 0.11%. This means that when the airlines randomly tested a larger percentage of employees per year, a smaller proportion of them tested positive for alcohol. This relationship between the frequency of alcohol testing and the proportion of positive tests is what we would expect to see if testing has a deterrent effect, though one study alone cannot prove that there is a deterrent effect. This study did not provide any information for other areas of interest to us, specifically: fatal injuries; non-fatal injuries (in which people are physically injured, but do not die); 'non-injury accidents'; that is, accidents in which people are not injured, but property, processes, materials, and/or the environment are damaged; absenteeism; and unwanted, or adverse, events associated with RDAT, including impacts on privacy, confidentiality and employee perceptions. Two of our team rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as number of studies, study size and methods. Overall, our confidence in the evidence was very low. This means we cannot rely on what this study reported to make generalisations about the effectiveness of random alcohol testing alone, or random alcohol testing combined with drug testing (RDAT), in the workplace.

644bc265cb8a19eab3311bab,static_2,Does yoga relieve cancer-related fatigue in people with cancer?,"Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is one of the most prevalent symptoms in individuals with cancer. Various types of exercise have shown beneficial effects. While previous systematic reviews suggest exercise may improve CRF and quality of life, evidence specifically about yoga's impact, as well as evidence on long-term effects, is limited. Previous syntheses offer promising but inconclusive findings on yoga's effectiveness. This review is one of a suite of five reviews exploring exercise for cancer-related fatigue.
To assess the effects of yoga versus no yoga on cancer-related fatigue in people with cancer: before, during, and after anticancer treatment; in the short, medium, and long term; and effects on quality of life (QoL), adverse events, depression, and anxiety.
We used CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, five other databases and two trials registers, together with reference checking, citation searching and contact with study authors to identify studies that are included in the review. The latest search date was October 2023.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing yoga to no yoga. We included studies in adults (aged 18 and older) with any type of cancer and anticancer therapy who received yoga before, during, or after anticancer therapy. We included trials evaluating at least one of the main outcomes (CRF or QoL). Yoga had to last for at least five sessions, and involve face-to-face instruction. We excluded trials with fewer than 20 participants randomised per group.
The outcomes of interest in this review are cancer-related fatigue (CRF), quality of life (QoL), adverse events, depression, and anxiety. We used standard methods expected by Cochrane. For analyses, we pooled results within the same period of outcome assessment (i.e. short, medium, and long term), and employed a random-effects model. We assessed risk of bias with the Cochrane risk of bias (RoB) 1 tool, and used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence.
We included 21 RCTs with 2041 people with cancer who received yoga during (13 studies) or after (eight studies) anticancer therapy; none examined yoga initiated before therapy. Here we present results on CRF and QoL; findings on adverse events, depression, and anxiety are in the full review. Yoga during anticancer therapy The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of yoga compared to no yoga on: short-term CRF (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.18 to 0.32; mean difference (MD) on Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI; lower values mean better outcome) of 0.16, 95% CI -0.41 to 0.71; 3 studies, 253 participants); medium-term CRF (MD on Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI; lower values mean better outcome) of -1.30, 95% CI -3.50 to 0.90; 1 study, 67 participants); and long-term CRF (MD 0.09 on BFI, 95% CI 1.16 to 0.98; 2 studies, 155 participants) (all very low-certainty evidence). Yoga may have a small beneficial effect or no effect compared to no yoga on short-term QoL (SMD 0.25, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.45; MD on Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30 (QLQ-C30; higher values mean better outcome) of 5.28, 95% CI 0.84 to 9.56; 4 studies, 374 participants) and medium-term QoL (MD on QLQ-C30 of 7.63, 95% CI 6.71 to 21.97; 2 studies, 151 participants), but the evidence is very uncertain (all very low-certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported long-term QoL. Yoga after anticancer therapy Yoga probably has a beneficial effect compared to no yoga on short-term CRF (SMD -0.26, 95% CI -0.42 to -0.09; MD 2.55, 95% CI 0.88 to 4.12; higher values mean better outcome; 5 studies, 602 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Yoga might have a beneficial effect or no effect compared to no yoga on medium-term CRF, but the evidence is very uncertain (MD 3.02, 95% CI -1.48 to 7.52; 1 study, 54 participants (higher values mean better outcome; very low-certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported long-term CRF. Yoga may have a small beneficial effect or no effect compared to no yoga on short-term QoL (SMD 0.19, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.47; MD -3.27, 95% CI -8.08 to 1.55; higher values mean better outcome; 4 studies, 275 participants) and medium term QoL (MD 7.06, 95% CI -1.38 to 15.50; 1 study, 54 participants; higher values mean better outcome), but the evidence is very uncertain (all very low-certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported long-term QoL. A key limitation of the review was the included studies' methodological constraints: participants' awareness of treatment assignments (yoga or control) potentially introduced bias. Additionally, sample sizes were too small to determine medium- and long-term effects conclusively. Further research is needed to evaluate the sustainability of yoga's impact on cancer-related fatigue, quality of life, and adverse events.
Our review provides uncertain evidence of the beneficial effects of yoga initiated during or after anticancer therapy compared to no yoga for people with cancer. Although there are indications supporting the use of yoga to address CRF, the uncertainty of the evidence underscores the need for caution in its implementation. Future RCTs should employ rigorous methodologies, enroll sufficient participants, and use appropriate controls.","Cancer-related fatigue is a feeling of extreme tiredness that lasts for a long time. It can be caused by cancer, cancer therapy, or both. Cancer-related fatigue affects the body and mood and makes it hard to perform regular activities. It is stronger than just being tired and does not go away by resting. Clinical guidelines recommend physical exercise to improve cancer-related fatigue. Physical exercise affects cancer-related fatigue by influencing biological and psychological processes, but it is unclear what types of exercise may be most beneficial. Yoga may reduce cancer-related fatigue and improve quality of life because it combines physical movement with breath control, mental focus, and body awareness. This review explored whether yoga improves cancer-related fatigue and quality of life in adults. We also examined whether any adverse events occurred in the studies. We investigated short-term (up to 12 weeks), medium-term (12 weeks to 6 months), and long-term (more than 6 months) effects. We searched for studies comparing yoga with no yoga in adults with any cancer, including yoga done before, during, or after anticancer therapy. Multiple types of yoga were included, such as Hatha and Dru yoga. We compared and summarised the results, assessed study quality, and considered differences based on type of yoga, cancer type, format of exercise (group vs individual; supervised vs unsupervised), and participant age. We found 21 studies involving 2041 participants with various cancers, mostly women with breast cancer. Yoga was initiated during anticancer therapy in 13 studies and after therapy in eight studies; no studies examined yoga before treatment. It is unclear whether yoga during anticancer therapy improves short, medium, or long-term cancer-related fatigue. Yoga during therapy may increase short- and medium-term quality of life, but the evidence is very uncertain, and no studies measured long-term quality of life. Only one study reported adverse events, so it is unclear whether yoga affects safety outcomes. No meaningful differences were found between different yoga types, training formats, supervision levels, or cancer types. Yoga after anticancer therapy probably reduces short-term cancer-related fatigue, but its effects on medium-term fatigue are unclear, and long-term fatigue was not measured. Yoga after therapy may slightly increase short and medium-term quality of life, but evidence is very uncertain, and long-term outcomes were not assessed. It is also unclear whether yoga after therapy leads to adverse events, and no differences were found between yoga types, cancer types, or age groups. Limitations include lack of blinding, which may influence results, and small or insufficiently long studies for several outcomes. More research is needed to determine how sustainable the effects of yoga are on cancer-related fatigue, quality of life, and adverse events.",1014,Cancer-related fatigue; anticancer therapy; quality of life; adverse events; Brief Fatigue Inventory; Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory; Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30,What factors were examined to assess study quality and differences in yoga's effects?,What is the potential impact of yoga on medium-term quality of life for cancer patients?,Select the items that are animals,What was the primary focus of the study reviewed in the plain-language summary?,What uncertainty is highlighted in the evidence regarding yoga's effect on quality of life during anticancer therapy?,"Type of yoga, format of exercise, and participant age; Geographic location of studies; Financial support of participants","Type of yoga, format of exercise, and participant age",The impact is unclear due to very uncertain evidence; There is a definite significant improvement; It consistently decreases quality of life,The impact is unclear due to very uncertain evidence,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,To compare the effects of different types of yoga on weight loss; To assess the impact of yoga on cancer-related fatigue and quality of life; To examine dietary interventions for cancer patients,To assess the impact of yoga on cancer-related fatigue and quality of life,No studies assessed long-term quality of life; Yoga significantly decreases quality of life; Certainty of increased short- and medium-term quality of life,No studies assessed long-term quality of life
644bc265cb8a19eab3311bab,interactive_3,Bisphosphonates and denosumab for breast cancer,"Bone is the most common site of metastatic disease associated with breast cancer (BC). Bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, and novel targeted therapies such as denosumab inhibit other key bone metabolism pathways. We have studied these agents in both early breast cancer and advanced breast cancer settings. This is an update of the review originally published in 2002 and subsequently updated in 2005 and 2012.
To assess the effects of bisphosphonates and other bone agents in addition to anti-cancer treatment: (i) in women with early breast cancer (EBC); (ii) in women with advanced breast cancer without bone metastases (ABC); and (iii) in women with metastatic breast cancer and bone metastases (BCBM).
In this review update, we searched Cochrane Breast Cancer's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov on 19 September 2016.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing: (a) one treatment with a bisphosphonate/bone-acting agent with the same treatment without a bisphosphonate/bone-acting agent; (b) treatment with one bisphosphonate versus treatment with a different bisphosphonate; (c) treatment with a bisphosphonate versus another bone-acting agent of a different mechanism of action (e.g. denosumab); and (d) immediate treatment with a bisphosphonate/bone-acting agent versus delayed treatment of the same bisphosphonate/bone-acting agent.
Two review authors independently extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and quality of the evidence. The primary outcome measure was bone metastases for EBC and ABC, and a skeletal-related event (SRE) for BCBM. We derived risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and the meta-analyses used random-effects models. Secondary outcomes included overall survival and disease-free survival for EBC; we derived hazard ratios (HRs) for these time-to-event outcomes where possible. We collected toxicity and quality-of-life information. GRADE was used to assess the quality of evidence for the most important outcomes in each treatment setting.
We included 44 RCTs involving 37,302 women. In women with EBC, bisphosphonates were associated with a reduced risk of bone metastases compared to placebo/no bisphosphonate (RR 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75 to 0.99; P = 0.03, 11 studies; 15,005 women; moderate-quality evidence with no significant heterogeneity). Bisphosphonates provided an overall survival benefit with time-to-event data (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.99; P = 0.04; 9 studies; 13,949 women; high-quality evidence with evidence of heterogeneity). Subgroup analysis by menopausal status showed a survival benefit from bisphosphonates in postmenopausal women (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.90; P = 0.001; 4 studies; 6048 women; high-quality evidence with no evidence of heterogeneity) but no survival benefit for premenopausal women (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.22; P = 0.78; 2 studies; 3501 women; high-quality evidence with no heterogeneity). There was evidence of no effect of bisphosphonates on disease-free survival (HR 0.94, 95% 0.87 to 1.02; P = 0.13; 7 studies; 12,578 women; high-quality evidence with significant heterogeneity present) however subgroup analyses showed a disease-free survival benefit from bisphosphonates in postmenopausal women only (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.91; P < 0.001; 7 studies; 8314 women; high-quality evidence with no heterogeneity). Bisphosphonates did not significantly reduce the incidence of fractures when compared to placebo/no bisphosphonates (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.08, P = 0.13, 6 studies, 7602 women; moderate-quality evidence due to wide confidence intervals). We await mature overall survival and disease-free survival results for denosumab trials. In women with ABC without clinically evident bone metastases, there was no evidence of an effect of bisphosphonates on bone metastases (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.43; P = 0.86; 3 studies; 330 women; moderate-quality evidence with no heterogeneity) or overall survival (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.09; P = 0.28; 3 studies; 330 women; high-quality evidence with no heterogeneity) compared to placebo/no bisphosphonates however the confidence intervals were wide. One study reported a trend towards an extended period of time without a SRE with bisphosphonate compared to placebo (low-quality evidence). One study reported quality of life and there was no apparent difference in scores between bisphosphonate and placebo (moderate-quality evidence). In women with BCBM, bisphosphonates reduced the SRE risk by 14% (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.95; P = 0.003; 9 studies; 2810 women; high-quality evidence with evidence of heterogeneity) compared with placebo/no bisphosphonates. This benefit persisted when administering either intravenous or oral bisphosphonates versus placebo. Bisphosphonates delayed the median time to a SRE with a median ratio of 1.43 (95% CI 1.29 to 1.58; P < 0.00001; 9 studies; 2891 women; high-quality evidence with no heterogeneity) and reduced bone pain (in 6 out of 11 studies; moderate-quality evidence) compared to placebo/no bisphosphonate. Treatment with bisphosphonates did not appear to affect overall survival (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.11; P = 0.85; 7 studies; 1935 women; moderate-quality evidence with significant heterogeneity). Quality-of-life scores were slightly better with bisphosphonates than placebo at comparable time points (in three out of five studies; moderate-quality evidence) however scores decreased during the course of the studies. Denosumab reduced the risk of developing a SRE compared with bisphosphonates by 22% (RR 0.78, 0.72 to 0.85; P < 0.001; 3 studies, 2345 women). One study reported data on overall survival and observed no difference in survival between denosumab and bisphosphonate. Reported toxicities across all settings were generally mild. Osteonecrosis of the jaw was rare, occurring less than 0.5% in the adjuvant setting (high-quality evidence).
For women with EBC, bisphosphonates reduce the risk of bone metastases and provide an overall survival benefit compared to placebo or no bisphosphonates. There is preliminary evidence suggestive that bisphosphonates provide an overall survival and disease-free survival benefit in postmenopausal women only when compared to placebo or no bisphosphonate. This was not a planned subgroup for these early trials, and we await the completion of new large clinical trials assessing benefit for postmenopausal women. For women with BCBM, bisphosphonates reduce the risk of developing SREs, delay the median time to an SRE, and appear to reduce bone pain compared to placebo or no bisphosphonate.","Breast cancer may spread and recur in the bones. This may cause fractures, pain and high calcium in the bloodstream (known as complications).
Medicines for osteoporosis may prevent these complications and may help cure cancer by reducing cancer growth in the bone. These medicines are called 'bisphosphonates'. A newer type is called  denosumab. Bisphosphonates or denosumab are given in addition to other cancer treatment medications. These may be given along with chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, or radiotherapy.
The goal of bisphosphonates and denosumab differs based on the women's breast cancer status.
We asked three main questions:
1. For women with early breast cancer (EBC) , can bisphosphonates or denosumab reduce the risk of the cancer spreading to the bone? Will adding this medicine to anticancer treatments allow women to live longer (improve survival)?
2. For women with advanced breast cancer which does not appear to involve the bone (ABC) , can bisphosphonates reduce the risk of the cancer spreading to the bone and improve survival? Will bisphosphonates reduce complications and improve quality of life?
3. For women with metastatic breast cancer that has spread to the bone (BCBM), can bisphosphonates or denosumab reduce the risk of complication, and improve quality of life and survival?
We found 44 studies involving 37,302 participants. We included studies published by September 2016.
For women with EBC, we included 17 studies with 26,129 participants. The women's health was monitored for at least 12 months from the start of the study. Some studies monitored women for 10 years.
The studies tested different types of bisphosphonate drugs and denosumab, and different doses of these drugs. Some studies compared the drugs to no treatment. Some studies used oral medications. Other studies gave the medicine as an injection into a vein or under the skin.
Bisphosphonates probably lowered the risk of cancer spreading to the bone.
Bisphosphonates were found to improve survival, but the benefit in the whole group of women was small. Postmenopausal women had a benefit from bisphosphonates with improved survival and reduced risk of cancer returning. Premenopausal women did not have improved survival or reduced risk of the cancer returning. New studies that test bisphosphonates by the women's menopausal status are awaited.
We await the reporting of data on survival and other important outcomes from denosumab trials.
For women with ABC that had not spread to the bone, we included three studies enrolling 330 participants. All three studies compared oral bisphosphonates to no treatment.
Bisphosphonates did not reduce the risk of cancer spreading to the bone or improve survival. Very little information was available on complications and quality of life from only one study.
For women with BCBM, we included 24 studies enrolling 10,853 participants. Their health was monitored for at least 12 months. Some women were followed for 24 months. Most studies compared bisphosphonates to receiving no medication.
Bisphosphonates reduced complications (fractures and bone pain). Bisphosphonates did not appear to increase the length of time women survived. Quality of life scores were slightly better for women receiving bisphosphonates compared to similar women having no bisphosphonates.
Denosumab reduced the risk of complications compared to bisphosphonates in the three studies that collected these data. There was no benefit in survival from denosumab in the one study that collected data.
Side effects were uncommon and mild. There was a rare risk of damage to the jaw bone (osteonecrosis of the jaw).
Overall, most of the evidence was moderate to high-quality.

644bc265cb8a19eab3311bab,interactive_4,Immunosuppressive treatment for focal segmental glomerulosclerosis in adults,"Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) can result from primary, genetic, or secondary causes; primary disease typically leads to nephrotic syndrome, while genetic and secondary forms may present with asymptomatic proteinuria or with nephrotic syndrome. Only about 20% of patients achieve partial or complete remission with treatment, and roughly half progress to kidney failure. This updated review assessed treatments for adults with FSGS and included 15 studies with 560 participants, all of whom had steroid-resistant disease since no trials evaluated corticosteroids versus placebo despite guidelines recommending steroids as first-line therapy. Five studies compared cyclosporin, with or without prednisone, to various treatments including no specific therapy, prednisone, methylprednisolone, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and dexamethasone. Other small single trials evaluated monoclonal antibodies such as adalimumab and fresolimumab, rituximab versus tacrolimus, cyclosporin plus valsartan versus cyclosporin alone, MMF versus prednisone, chlorambucil with steroids versus no treatment, different dexamethasone regimens, CCX140-B versus placebo, and one larger study compared sparsentan to irbesartan. Evidence for cyclosporin suggested it may increase the likelihood of complete remission and of combined complete or partial remission, though results were imprecise and based on few small trials. Cyclosporin showed little to no difference in preventing chronic kidney disease progression or kidney failure, and its effects on hypertension or infection remained uncertain. MMF appeared to offer little or no difference compared to prednisone for remission outcomes or kidney function, and most other interventions had very low certainty evidence, preventing firm conclusions. It is also uncertain whether sparsentan reduces proteinuria more effectively than irbesartan. Overall, no trials evaluated the recommended first-line therapy of corticosteroids, and the available evidence applies only to steroid-resistant FSGS. Cyclosporin may improve remission rates when given for at least six months, but confidence in these findings is limited by the small size and variability of the studies. Future trials must more clearly define patient populations distinguishing primary, genetic, and secondary FSGS to support stronger treatment recommendations.","Nephrotic syndrome is a condition where the kidneys leak protein from the blood into the urine. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) defined on kidney biopsy is an uncommon cause of nephrotic syndrome disease but it progresses to kidney failure in about half of all cases. It can be divided into three groups - primary FSGS (thought to be due to a factor circulating in the blood that damages the kidneys), genetic (secondary to mutations in one or more genes), and secondary to other causes, including certain infections. Treatments aim to reduce the amount of protein in the urine completely or partly to increase the time before kidney failure develops.
We looked at all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which examined therapy with prednisone or other agents which affect the immune system such as cyclosporin and mycophenolate mofetil and other agents with or without steroid therapy. We found 15 studies involving 553 participants. In five studies cyclosporin was compared with different treatments. Combining four studies (231 participants) showed that cyclosporin was more effective than these other treatments in achieving complete remission of nephrotic syndrome. The studies were too small and lasted for too short a time to determine if cyclosporin reduced the risk of kidney failure. Nine small studies examined different medicines that suppress the body's immune system. None of these treatments reduced the amount of protein in the urine.
We found limited information that cyclosporin may reduce the amount of protein in the urine in some people with FSGS but the data are uncertain because the studies enrolled too few participants. We need new agents for the treatment of FSGS with nephrotic syndrome to prevent kidney failure.",1087,nephrotic syndrome; proteinuria; cyclosporin; monoclonal antibodies; mycophenolate mofetil (MMF); chlorambucil; sparsentan; irbesartan; chronic kidney disease; glomerulosclerosis,What is nephrotic syndrome?,What was the main aim of the treatments studied for FSGS?,Select all of the following that are colors,"According to the summary, how effective was cyclosporin compared to other treatments in achieving remission?",What was a limitation of the studies involving cyclosporin mentioned in the summary?,A condition that causes kidneys to leak protein into the urine; A genetic disorder caused by mutations in genes; An infection that affects kidney function,A condition that causes kidneys to leak protein into the urine,To reduce protein in the urine; To cure the genetic mutation causing FSGS; To eliminate all kidney infections,To reduce protein in the urine,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Cyclosporin was more effective; Cyclosporin was equally effective; Cyclosporin was less effective,Cyclosporin was more effective,Small number of participants; Long duration of studies; Large diversity in participant conditions,Small number of participants

This subtype is more common in women than men, is less associated with smoking, but occurs at a younger age than sporadic tumours.
To assess the clinical effectiveness of single-agent or combination EGFR therapies used in the first-line treatment of people with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR M+ NSCLC compared with other cytotoxic chemotherapy (CTX) agents used alone or in combination, or best supportive care (BSC). The primary outcomes were overall survival and progression-free survival. Secondary outcomes included response rate, symptom palliation, toxicity, and health-related quality of life.
We conducted electronic searches of the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2020, Issue 7), MEDLINE (1946 to 27th July 2020), Embase (1980 to 27th July 2020), and ISI Web of Science (1899 to 27th July 2020). We also searched the conference abstracts of the American Society for Clinical Oncology and the European Society for Medical Oncology (July 2020); Evidence Review Group submissions to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence; and the reference lists of retrieved articles.
Parallel-group randomised controlled trials comparing EGFR-targeted agents (alone or in combination with cytotoxic agents or BSC) with cytotoxic chemotherapy (single or doublet) or BSC in chemotherapy-naive patients with locally advanced or metastatic (stage IIIB or IV) EGFR M+ NSCLC unsuitable for treatment with curative intent.
Two review authors independently identified articles, extracted data, and carried out the 'Risk of bias' assessment. We conducted meta-analyses using a fixed-effect model unless there was substantial heterogeneity, in which case we also performed a random-effects analysis as a sensitivity analysis.
Twenty-two trials met the inclusion criteria. Ten of these exclusively recruited people with EGFR M+ NSCLC; the remainder recruited a mixed population and reported results for people with EGFR M+ NSCLC as subgroup analyses. The number of participants with EGFR M+ tumours totalled 3023, of whom approximately 2563 were of Asian origin. Overall survival (OS) data showed inconsistent results between the included trials that compared EGFR-targeted treatments against cytotoxic chemotherapy or placebo. Erlotinib was used in eight trials, gefitinib in nine trials, afatinib in two trials, cetuximab in two trials, and icotinib in one trial. The findings of FASTACT 2 suggested a clinical benefit for OS for participants treated with erlotinib plus cytotoxic chemotherapy when compared to cytotoxic chemotherapy alone, as did the Han 2017 trial for gefitinib plus cytotoxic chemotherapy, but both results were based on a small number of participants (n = 97 and 122, respectively). For progression-free survival (PFS), a pooled analysis of four trials showed evidence of clinical benefit for erlotinib compared with cytotoxic chemotherapy (hazard ratio (HR) 0.31; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25 to 0.39 ; 583 participants ; high-certainty evidence). A pooled analysis of two trials of gefitinib versus paclitaxel plus carboplatin showed evidence of clinical benefit for PFS for gefitinib (HR 0.39; 95% CI 0.32 to 0.48 ; 491 participants high-certainty evidence), and a pooled analysis of two trials of gefitinib versus pemetrexed plus carboplatin with pemetrexed maintenance also showed evidence of clinical benefit for PFS for gefitinib (HR 0.59; 95% CI 0.46 to 0.74, 371 participants ; moderate-certainty evidence). Afatinib showed evidence of clinical benefit for PFS when compared with chemotherapy in a pooled analysis of two trials (HR 0.42; 95% CI 0.34 to 0.53, 709 participants high-certainty evidence). All but one small trial showed a corresponding improvement in response rate with tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) compared to chemotherapy. Commonly reported grade 3/4 adverse events associated with afatinib, erlotinib, gefitinib and icotinib monotherapy were rash and diarrhoea. Myelosuppression was consistently worse in the chemotherapy arms; fatigue and anorexia were also associated with some chemotherapies. Seven trials reported on health-related quality of life and symptom improvement using different methodologies. For each of erlotinib, gefitinib, and afatinib, two trials showed improvement in one or more indices for the TKI compared to chemotherapy. The quality of evidence was high for the comparisons of erlotinib and gefitinib with cytotoxic chemotherapy and for the comparison of afatinib with cytotoxic chemotherapy.
Erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib and icotinib are all active agents in EGFR M+ NSCLC patients, and demonstrate an increased tumour response rate and prolonged PFS compared to cytotoxic chemotherapy. We found a beneficial effect of the TKI compared to cytotoxic chemotherapy in adverse effect and health-related quality of life. We found limited evidence for increased OS for the TKI when compared with standard chemotherapy, but the majority of the included trials allowed participants to switch treatments on disease progression, which will have a confounding effect on any OS analysis. Single agent-TKI remains the standard of care and the benefit of combining a TKI and chemotherapy remains uncertain as the evidence is based on small patient numbers. Cytotoxic chemotherapy is less effective in EGFR M+ NSCLC than erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib or icotinib and is associated with greater toxicity. There are no data supporting the use of monoclonal antibody therapy. Icotinib is not available outside China.","Lung cancer is the most common cancer in the world. It has often spread by the time it is diagnosed. Therefore, surgery is usually not possible and drug treatment, typically chemotherapy, is needed. The commonest type of lung cancer is non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Around 10% to 15% of people with NSCLC will have a specific kind of cancer known as epidermal growth factor receptor positive (EGFR M+), in which there are changes in the cancer cells to the genes controlling tumour growth. In this review, we looked at new treatments that can target EGFR M+ NSCLC to find out how well they work.
The purpose of this review was to find out whether people given treatments targeted at EGFR M+ NSCLC live longer and have a better health-related quality of life than people having standard chemotherapy.
We found 22 trials that looked at five different EGFR-targeted drugs and compared them with standard chemotherapy treatment: erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib, icotinib and the antibody cetuximab. We included trials reporting results up to 27 July 2020.
Our results showed that people given erlotinib, gefitinib,afatinib or icotinib have a longer time before the cancer progresses and experience fewer side effects than those people given standard chemotherapy. However, we could not be sure whether people given erlotinib, afatinib or icotinib live any longer than those given standard chemotherapy.
Erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib and icotinib delay further spread of EGFR M+ lung cancer and improve health-related quality of life. Giving cetuximab with chemotherapy is no better at controlling this type of cancer or extending life than chemotherapy alone.",1020,EGFR mutation positive; non-small cell lung cancer; cytotoxic chemotherapy; erlotinib; gefitinib; afatinib; icotinib; progression-free survival; overall survival; health-related quality of life,Critically assess why the study concludes that TKIs improve health-related quality of life compared to chemotherapy.,What was the primary focus of the study regarding EGFR M+ NSCLC treatments?,Select all of the following that are fruits,Which EGFR-targeted drugs were found to delay cancer progression in the study?,"What outcome was specifically associated with erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib, and icotinib use in the study?",TKIs are shown to delay cancer progression and have fewer side effects; TKIs consistently improve overall survival in all trials; Monoclonal antibodies have proven superior to TKIs,TKIs are shown to delay cancer progression and have fewer side effects,To determine if EGFR-targeted drugs improve progression-free survival; To investigate the genetic causes of NSCLC; To compare different surgical options for EGFR-positive lung cancer,To determine if EGFR-targeted drugs improve progression-free survival,dog; blue; grape,grape,Erlotinib; Gefitinib; Cetuximab,Erlotinib; Gefitinib,They improved health-related quality of life; They increased overall survival; They caused more severe side effects than chemotherapy,They improved health-related quality of life
644bc265cb8a19eab3311bab,finetuned_5,Psychosocial interventions for the prevention of disability following traumatic physical injury,"Traumatic physical injury can result in many disabling sequelae including physical and mental health problems and impaired social functioning.
To assess the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions in the prevention of physical, mental and social disability following traumatic physical injury.
The search was not restricted by date, language or publication status. We searched the following electronic databases; Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 1), MEDLINE (Ovid SP), EMBASE (Ovid SP), PsycINFO (Ovid SP), Controlled Trials metaRegister (www.controlled-trials.com), AMED (Allied & Complementary Medicine), ISI Web of Science: Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI), PubMed. We also screened the reference lists of all selected papers and contacted authors of relevant studies. The latest search for trials was in February 2008.
Randomised controlled trials that consider one or more defined psychosocial interventions for the prevention of physical disability, mental health problems or reduced social functioning as a result of traumatic physical injury. We excluded studies that included patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Two authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of search results, reviewed the full text of potentially relevant studies, independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. We included five studies, involving 756 participants. Three studies assessed the effect of brief psychological therapies, one assessed the impact of a self-help booklet, and one the effect of collaborative care. The disparate nature of the trials covering different patient populations, interventions and outcomes meant that it was not possible to pool data meaningfully across studies. There was no evidence of a protective effect of brief psychological therapy or educational booklets on preventing disability. There was evidence from one trial of a reduction in both post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depressive symptoms one month after injury in those who received a collaborative care intervention combined with a brief psycho-educational intervention, however this was not retained at follow up. Overall mental health status was the only disability outcome affected by any intervention. In three trials the psychosocial intervention had a detrimental effect on the mental health status of patients. This review provides no convincing evidence of the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for the prevention of disability following traumatic physical injury. Taken together, our findings cannot be considered as supporting the provision of psychosocial interventions to prevent aspects of disability arising from physical injury. However, these conclusions are based on a small number of disparate trials with small to moderate sample sizes and are therefore necessarily cautious. More research, using larger sample sizes, and similar interventions and patient populations to enable pooling of results, is needed before these findings can be confirmed.","Traumatic physical injury such as that resulting from road traffic accidents, falls and fires can cause high levels of subsequent disability in the person affected. This may include physical disability as a result of the initial injury and subsequent complications, mental health problems such as depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a result of the trauma of the event which caused the injury and the resulting physical and social problems, and social problems such as loss of social life and unemployment. It is therefore important to evaluate interventions which seek to prevent these adverse secondary outcomes. Psychosocial interventions, which include psychological therapies such as interpersonal counselling and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), and social interventions such as befriending, social support and self-help advice, delivered soon after the injury, may help to prevent these problems.
This review identified five randomised controlled trials, involving 756 participants, which evaluated psychosocial interventions for the prevention of disability following traumatic injury. No convincing evidence was found supporting the efficacy of these interventions. In particular, self-help booklets and interpersonal therapies had no effect on preventing disability. There was some evidence that a more complex intervention involving collaborative care reduced symptoms of depression and PTSD in the short but not the medium term. There was evidence from three trials that psychosocial interventions had a detrimental effect on mental health. Taken together, our findings cannot be taken as supporting the provision of psychosocial interventions to prevent aspects of disability arising from physical injury. These results suggest that future interventions should focus on screening patients at risk of poor outcomes and only treating those who develop subsequent problems. However, the strength of these conclusions is limited by the small size and varied nature of many of the trials, which means that their results cannot be pooled.",1060,psychosocial interventions; traumatic physical injury; disabling sequelae; physical disability; mental health problems; social functioning; collaborative care; post-traumatic stress disorder; depressive symptoms; psycho-educational intervention,What types of disabilities can traumatic physical injury cause?,Identify the primary purpose of evaluating psychosocial interventions in the context of traumatic injuries.,Select all of the following that are colors,Which psychosocial intervention showed short-term efficacy in reducing depressive symptoms?,Explain the overall finding regarding the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions after a traumatic injury.,Physical and mental health problems; Improved social interactions; Increased employment opportunities,Physical and mental health problems,To prevent adverse secondary outcomes; To reduce the cost of medical treatments; To enhance physical strength,To prevent adverse secondary outcomes,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Collaborative care intervention; Self-help booklet; Interpersonal therapy,Collaborative care intervention,No convincing evidence supports their efficacy; Effective in preventing all types of disability; Significantly improved physical recovery,No convincing evidence supports their efficacy
644bc265cb8a19eab3311bab,finetuned_6,"Thymic peptides for treatment of cancer patients in addition to chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or both","Purified thymus extracts (pTE) and synthetic thymic peptides (sTP) are thought to enhance the immune system of cancer patients to help fight tumour growth and reduce infections caused by disease-related or treatment-related immunosuppression. This review evaluated the effectiveness of pTE and sTP for cancer management. Researchers searched major medical databases up to February 2010 for randomized trials in adult cancer patients where pTE or sTP were added to chemotherapy or radiotherapy and compared with the same regimen alone or with placebo. Data were independently extracted by two authors, and odds ratios were calculated for overall survival, disease-free survival, tumour response, and adverse effects. A random-effects model was used. Twenty-six trials involving 2736 patients were identified: 20 trials investigated pTE (thymostimulin or thymosin fraction 5) and six investigated sTP (thymopentin or thymosin ?1). Twenty-one trials reported overall survival, six reported disease-free survival, 14 reported tumour response, nine reported adverse effects, and 10 reported safety. Adding pTE showed no benefit for overall survival (RR 1.00), disease-free survival (RR 0.97), or tumour response (RR 1.07), with moderate to high heterogeneity. For thymosin ?1, the pooled RR for overall survival was 1.21 and for disease-free survival was 3.37, though neither result reached statistical significance. pTE reduced the risk of severe infectious complications (RR 0.54), and thymostimulin showed a non-significant trend toward reduced severe neutropenia. Both pTE and sTP were generally well tolerated. Many trials had at least moderate risk of bias. Overall, there is no clear evidence that adding pTE to cancer treatment improves survival or tumour response, although thymosin ?1 showed a possible trend toward benefit. There is preliminary evidence that pTE may reduce severe infectious complications during chemotherapy or radiotherapy.","The immune system plays a key role in the body's own defences against cancer cells. The thymus gland plays a central part in this and modifies T-cells, a subset of lymphocytes. Studies with thymic peptides have shown a variety of effects on the immune system. There are two groups of thymic peptides available for use in treatment: purified extracts from animal (mostly calf) thymus glands and synthetically produced thymus gland peptides.
This review aims to answer the question whether having thymic peptides can improve the response to and tolerability of standard chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or combined treatment. Further questions are whether the peptides inhibit or reduce the progression and recurrence of disease, whether they prolong the life of cancer patients and whether quality of life is improved. This review looked at the evidence from 26 clinical trials with a total of 2736 adult cancer patients. Many of the trials were small and of moderate quality. Only three studies were less than 10 years old. Thymosin ?1 is a synthetic peptide that shows some promise as a treatment option for patients with metastatic melanoma when used in addition to chemotherapy. Severe problems occur during chemotherapy and radiotherapy due to low white blood cell counts and infections. These were reduced by using purified thymus extracts. However, the use of purified thymus extracts should be investigated more thoroughly before the extracts are used routinely in patients. The findings were not conclusive and caution is advised.

644bc265cb8a19eab3311bab,finetuned_6,Does personalised advice via computer or mobile devices reduce heavy drinking?,"Excessive alcohol use contributes significantly to physical and psychological illness, injury and death, and a wide array of social harm in all age groups. A proven strategy for reducing excessive alcohol consumption levels is to offer a brief conversation-based intervention in primary care settings, but more recent technological innovations have enabled people to interact directly via computer, mobile device or smartphone with digital interventions designed to address problem alcohol consumption. To assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of digital interventions for reducing hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption, alcohol-related problems, or both, in people living in the community, specifically: (i) Are digital interventions more effective and cost-effective than no intervention (or minimal input) controls? (ii) Are digital interventions at least equally effective as face-to-face brief alcohol interventions? (iii) What are the effective component behaviour change techniques (BCTs) of such interventions and their mechanisms of action? (iv) What theories or models have been used in the development and/or evaluation of the intervention? Secondary objectives were (i) to assess whether outcomes differ between trials where the digital intervention targets participants attending health, social care, education or other community-based settings and those where it is offered remotely via the internet or mobile phone platforms; (ii) to specify interventions according to their mode of delivery (e.g. functionality features) and assess the impact of mode of delivery on outcomes. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ERIC, HTA and Web of Knowledge databases; ClinicalTrials.com and WHO ICTRP trials registers and relevant websites to April 2017. We also checked the reference lists of included trials and relevant systematic reviews. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effectiveness of digital interventions compared with no intervention or with face-to-face interventions for reducing hazardous or harmful alcohol consumption in people living in the community and reported a measure of alcohol consumption. We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. We included 57 studies which randomised a total of 34,390 participants. The main sources of bias were from attrition and participant blinding (36% and 21% of studies respectively, high risk of bias). Forty one studies (42 comparisons, 19,241 participants) provided data for the primary meta-analysis, which demonstrated that participants using a digital intervention drank approximately 23 g alcohol weekly (95% CI 15 to 30) (about 3 UK units) less than participants who received no or minimal interventions at end of follow up (moderate-quality evidence). Fifteen studies (16 comparisons, 10,862 participants) demonstrated that participants who engaged with digital interventions had less than one drinking day per month fewer than no intervention controls (moderate-quality evidence), 15 studies (3587 participants) showed about one binge drinking session less per month in the intervention group compared to no intervention controls (moderate-quality evidence), and in 15 studies (9791 participants) intervention participants drank one unit per occasion less than no intervention control participants (moderate-quality evidence). Only five small studies (390 participants) compared digital and face-to-face interventions. There was no difference in alcohol consumption at end of follow up (MD 0.52 g/week, 95% CI -24.59 to 25.63; low-quality evidence). Thus, digital alcohol interventions produced broadly similar outcomes in these studies. No studies reported whether any adverse effects resulted from the interventions. A median of nine BCTs were used in experimental arms (range = 1 to 22). 'B' is an estimate of effect (MD in quantity of drinking, expressed in g/week) per unit increase in the BCT, and is a way to report whether individual BCTs are linked to the effect of the intervention. The BCTs of goal setting (B -43.94, 95% CI -78.59 to -9.30), problem solving (B -48.03, 95% CI -77.79 to -18.27), information about antecedents (B -74.20, 95% CI -117.72 to -30.68), behaviour substitution (B -123.71, 95% CI -184.63 to -62.80) and credible source (B -39.89, 95% CI -72.66 to -7.11) were significantly associated with reduced alcohol consumption in unadjusted models. In a multivariable model that included BCTs with B > 23 in the unadjusted model, the BCTs of behaviour substitution (B -95.12, 95% CI -162.90 to -27.34), problem solving (B -45.92, 95% CI -90.97 to -0.87), and credible source (B -32.09, 95% CI -60.64 to -3.55) were associated with reduced alcohol consumption. The most frequently mentioned theories or models in the included studies were Motivational Interviewing Theory (7/20), Transtheoretical Model (6/20) and Social Norms Theory (6/20). Over half of the interventions (n = 21, 51%) made no mention of theory. Only two studies used theory to select participants or tailor the intervention. There was no evidence of an association between reporting theory use and intervention effectiveness. There is moderate-quality evidence that digital interventions may lower alcohol consumption, with an average reduction of up to three (UK) standard drinks per week compared to control participants. Substantial heterogeneity and risk of performance and publication bias may mean the reduction was lower. Low-quality evidence from fewer studies suggested there may be little or no difference in impact on alcohol consumption between digital and face-to-face interventions. The BCTs of behaviour substitution, problem solving and credible source were associated with the effectiveness of digital interventions to reduce alcohol consumption and warrant further investigation in an experimental context. Reporting of theory use was very limited and often unclear when present. Over half of the interventions made no reference to any theories. Limited reporting of theory use was unrelated to heterogeneity in intervention effectiveness.","We aimed to find out if personalised advice to reduce heavy drinking provided using a computer or mobile device is better than nothing or printed information. We also compared advice provided using a computer or mobile device to advice given in a face-to-face conversation. The main outcome was how much alcohol people drank.
Heavy drinking causes over 60 diseases, as well as many accidents, injuries and early deaths each year. Brief advice or counselling, delivered by doctors or nurses, can help people reduce their drinking by around 4 to 5 units a week. In the UK, this is around two pints (1.13 L) of beer or half a bottle of wine (375 mL) each week. However, people may be embarrassed by talking about alcohol. The studies included people in workplaces, colleges or health clinics and internet users. Everyone typed information about their drinking into a computer or mobile device - which then gave half the people advice about how much they drank and the effect this has on health. This group also received suggestions about how to cut down on drinking. The other group could sometimes read general health information. Between one month and one year later, everyone was asked to confirm how much they were drinking. Drinking levels in both groups were compared to each other at these time points. Many (56%) studies were funded by government or research foundation funds. Some (11%) were funded by personal awards such as PhD fellowships. The rest did not report sources of funding. We included 57 studies comparing the drinking of people getting advice about alcohol from computers or mobile devices with those who did not after one to 12 months. Of these, 41 studies (42 comparisons, 19,241 participants) focused on the actual amounts that people reported drinking each week. Most people reported drinking less if they received advice about alcohol from a computer or mobile device compared to people who did not get this advice. Evidence shows that the amount of alcohol people cut down may be about 1.5 pints (800 mL) of beer or a third of a bottle of wine (250 mL) each week. Other measures supported the effectiveness of digital alcohol interventions, although the size of the effect tended to be smaller than for overall alcohol consumption. Positive differences in measures of drinking were seen at 1, 6 and 12 months after the advice. There was not enough information to help us decide if advice was better from computers, telephones or the internet to reduce risky drinking. We do not know which pieces of advice were the most important to help people reduce problem drinking. However, advice from trusted people such as doctors seemed helpful, as did recommendations that people think about specific ways they could overcome problems that might prevent them from drinking less and suggestions about things to do instead of drinking. We included five studies which compared the drinking of people who got advice from computers or mobile devices with advice from face-to-face conversations with doctors or nurses; there may be little or no difference between these to reduce heavy drinking. No studies reported whether any harm came from the interventions. Personalised advice using computers or mobile devices may help people reduce heavy drinking better than doing nothing or providing only general health information. Personalised advice through computers or mobile devices may make little or no difference to reduce drinking compared to face-to-face conversation.",1061,brief conversation-based intervention; hazardous alcohol consumption; community-based settings; behavior change techniques; Behavior substitution,What specific behavior change techniques (BCTs) were most strongly associated with the effectiveness of digital interventions?,Which measure was used as a key outcome for assessing digital interventions?,Select the items that are animals,How is the advice delivered through digital interventions typically personalized?,In what way did the results vary when digital interventions were compared with face-to-face advice?,Goal setting and credible source; Behavior substitution and problem-solving; Information about antecedents and behavior substitution,Behavior substitution and problem-solving,How much alcohol people drank; The participants' weight loss; The number of exercise sessions per week,How much alcohol people drank,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,By considering individual drinking habits and health effects; By providing generalized health tips; By sending automated text messages at fixed times,By considering individual drinking habits and health effects,There was little or no difference in effectiveness; Digital was significantly more effective; Face-to-face was significantly more effective,There was little or no difference in effectiveness
6314c1e76c3f71e2127f1976,static_1,Glucagon-like peptide analogues for type 2 diabetes,"Glucagon-like peptide analogues are a new class of drugs used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes that mimic the endogenous hormone glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1). GLP-1 is an incretin, a gastrointestinal hormone that is released into the circulation in response to ingested nutrients. GLP-1 regulates glucose levels by stimulating glucose-dependent insulin secretion and biosynthesis, and by suppressing glucagon secretion, delayed gastric emptying and promoting satiety.
To assess the effects of glucagon-like peptide analogues in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Studies were obtained from electronic searches of The Cochrane Library (last search issue 1, 2011), MEDLINE (last search March 2011), EMBASE (last search March 2011), Web of Science (last search March 2011) and databases of ongoing trials.
Studies were included if they were randomised controlled trials of a minimum duration of eight weeks comparing a GLP-1 analogue with placebo, insulin, an oral anti-diabetic agent, or another GLP-1 analogue in people with type 2 diabetes.
Data extraction and quality assessment of studies were done by one reviewer and checked by a second. Data were analysed by type of GLP-1 agonist and comparison treatment. Where appropriate, data were summarised in a meta-analysis (mean differences and risk ratios summarised using a random-effects model).
Seventeen randomised controlled trials including relevant analyses for 6899 participants were included in the analysis. Studies were mostly of short duration, usually 26 weeks. In comparison with placebo, all GLP-1 agonists reduced glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels by about 1%. Exenatide 2 mg once weekly and liraglutide 1.8 mg reduced it by 0.20% and 0.24% respectively more than insulin glargine. Exenatide 2 mg once weekly reduced HbA1c more than exenatide 10 ?g twice daily, sitagliptin and pioglitazone. Liraglutide 1.8 mg reduced HbA1c by 0.33% more than exenatide 10 ?g twice daily. Liraglutide led to similar improvements in HbA1c compared to sulphonylureas but reduced it more than sitagliptin and rosiglitazone. Both exenatide and liraglutide led to greater weight loss than most active comparators, including in participants not experiencing nausea. Hypoglycaemia occurred more frequently in participants taking concomitant sulphonylurea. GLP-1 agonists caused gastrointestinal adverse effects, mainly nausea. These adverse events were strongest at the beginning and then subsided. Beta-cell function was improved with GLP-1 agonists but the effect did not persist after cessation of treatment. None of the studies was long enough to assess long-term positive or negative effects.
GLP-1 agonists are effective in improving glycaemic control.","Glucagon-like peptide analogues or agonists are a new kind of drug in the treatment of type 2 diabetes that are given by injection under the skin. They regulate glucose levels by stimulating glucose-dependent insulin secretion and biosynthesis, and by suppressing glucagon secretion, delaying gastric emptying and promoting satiety. Various glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists are in use or in the licensing process, including exenatide, liraglutide, albiglutide, taspoglutide, lixisenatide and LY2189265.
Seventeen randomised controlled trials of mostly moderate to high quality randomised approximately 6899 people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Studies were mostly of short duration, usually 26 weeks. The longest duration study was 30 weeks. Of the seventeen studies, one compared albiglutide with placebo, two compared exenatide 10µg twice daily against exenatide 2 mg once weekly, one compared exenatide 2 mg once weekly against insulin glargine, one compared exenatide 2 mg once weekly against pioglitazone and sitagliptin, five compared liraglutide with placebo, two compared liraglutide with sulphonylurea, one each compared exenatide twice daily with liraglutide, liraglutide with sitagliptin, liraglutide with rosiglitazone and liraglutide with insulin glargine, two compared taspoglutide with placebo and one each compared lixisenatide with placebo and LY2189265 with placebo. In people already treated with oral anti-diabetes drugs, addition of glucagon-like peptide analogues improved blood sugar control in comparison to placebo, rosiglitazone, pioglitazone or sitagliptin, but not always in comparison to insulin (for exenatide) or glimepiride (a sulphonylurea). Glucagon-like peptide analogous caused more weight loss than any of the comparison treatments. However, more nausea and other gastrointestinal effects such as diarrhoea or vomiting were seen, though these tended to wear off and were not seen in all participants. There was slightly more hypoglycaemia with glucagon-like analogous than with placebo, but generally less than with other anti-diabetic treatments. The incidence of hypoglycaemia occurred more frequently in participants taking concomitant sulphonylurea. The studies were not long enough to assess long-term side effects.

6314c1e76c3f71e2127f1976,static_2,Telerehabilitation services for stroke,"Telerehabilitation offers an alternate way of delivering rehabilitation services. Information and communication technologies are used to facilitate communication between the healthcare professional and the patient in a remote location. The use of telerehabilitation is becoming more viable as the speed and sophistication of communication technologies improve. However, it is currently unclear how effective this model of delivery is relative to rehabilitation delivered face-to-face or when added to usual care.
To determine whether the use of telerehabilitation leads to improved ability to perform activities of daily living amongst stroke survivors when compared with (1) in-person rehabilitation (when the clinician and the patient are at the same physical location and rehabilitation is provided face-to-face); or (2) no rehabilitation or usual care. Secondary objectives were to determine whether use of telerehabilitation leads to greater independence in self-care and domestic life and improved mobility, balance, health-related quality of life, depression, upper limb function, cognitive function or functional communication when compared with in-person rehabilitation and no rehabilitation. Additionally, we aimed to report on the presence of adverse events, cost-effectiveness, feasibility and levels of user satisfaction associated with telerehabilitation interventions.
We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (June 2019), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (the Cochrane Library, Issue 6, 2019), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to June 2019), Embase (1974 to June 2019), and eight additional databases. We searched trial registries and reference lists.
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of telerehabilitation in stroke. We included studies that compared telerehabilitation with in-person rehabilitation or no rehabilitation. In addition, we synthesised and described the results of RCTs that compared two different methods of delivering telerehabilitation services without an alternative group. We included rehabilitation programmes that used a combination of telerehabilitation and in-person rehabilitation provided that the greater proportion of intervention was provided via telerehabilitation.
Two review authors independently identified trials on the basis of prespecified inclusion criteria, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. A third review author moderated any disagreements. The review authors contacted investigators to ask for missing information. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence and interpret findings.
We included 22 trials in the review involving a total of 1937 participants. The studies ranged in size from the inclusion of 10 participants to 536 participants, and reporting quality was often inadequate, particularly in relation to random sequence generation and allocation concealment. Selective outcome reporting and incomplete outcome data were apparent in several studies. Study interventions and comparisons varied, meaning that, in many cases, it was inappropriate to pool studies. Intervention approaches included post-hospital discharge support programs, upper limb training, lower limb and mobility retraining and communication therapy for people with post-stroke language disorders. Studies were either conducted upon discharge from hospital or with people in the subacute or chronic phases following stroke. Primary outcome: we found moderate-quality evidence that there was no difference in activities of daily living between people who received a post-hospital discharge telerehabilitation intervention and those who received usual care (based on 2 studies with 661 participants (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.15 to 0.15)). We found low-quality evidence of no difference in effects on activities of daily living between telerehabilitation and in-person physical therapy programmes (based on 2 studies with 75 participants: SMD 0.03, 95% CI -0.43 to 0.48). Secondary outcomes: we found a low quality of evidence that there was no difference between telerehabilitation and in-person rehabilitation for balance outcomes (based on 3 studies with 106 participants: SMD 0.08, 95%CI -0.30 to 0.46). Pooling of three studies with 569 participants showed moderate-quality evidence that there was no difference between those who received post-discharge support interventions and those who received usual care on health-related quality of life (SMD 0.03, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.20). Similarly, pooling of six studies (with 1145 participants) found moderate-quality evidence that there was no difference in depressive symptoms when comparing post-discharge tele-support programs with usual care (SMD -0.04, 95% CI -0.19 to 0.11). We found no difference between groups for upper limb function (based on 3 studies with 170 participants: mean difference (MD) 1.23, 95% CI -2.17 to 4.64, low-quality evidence) when a computer program was used to remotely retrain upper limb function in comparison to in-person therapy. Evidence was insufficient to draw conclusions on the effects of telerehabilitation on mobility or participant satisfaction with the intervention. No studies evaluated the cost-effectiveness of telerehabilitation; however, five of the studies reported health service utilisation outcomes or costs of the interventions provided within the study. Two studies reported on adverse events, although no serious trial-related adverse events were reported.
While there is now an increasing number of RCTs testing the efficacy of telerehabilitation, it is hard to draw conclusions about the effects as interventions and comparators varied greatly across studies. In addition, there were few adequately powered studies and several studies included in this review were at risk of bias. At this point, there is only low or moderate-level evidence testing whether telerehabilitation is a more effective or similarly effective way to provide rehabilitation. Short-term post-hospital discharge telerehabilitation programmes have not been shown to reduce depressive symptoms, improve quality of life, or improve independence in activities of daily living when compared with usual care. Studies comparing telerehabilitation and in-person therapy have also not found significantly different outcomes between groups, suggesting that telerehabilitation is not inferior. Some studies reported that telerehabilitation was less expensive to provide but information was lacking about cost-effectiveness. Only two trials reported on whether or not any adverse events had occurred; these trials found no serious adverse events were related to telerehabilitation. The field is still emerging and more studies are needed to draw more definitive conclusions. In addition, while this review examined the efficacy of telerehabilitation when tested in randomised trials, studies that use mixed methods to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of telehealth interventions are incredibly valuable in measuring outcomes.","This review aimed to gather evidence for the use of telerehabilitation after stroke. We aimed to compare telerehabilitation with therapy delivered face-to-face and with no therapy (usual care).
Stroke is a common cause of disability in adults. After a stroke, it is common for the individual to have difficulty managing everyday activities such as walking, showering, dressing, and participating in community activities. Many people need rehabilitation after stroke; this is usually provided by healthcare professionals in a hospital or clinic setting. Recent studies have investigated whether it is possible to use technologies such as the telephone or the Internet to help people communicate with healthcare professionals without having to leave their home. This approach, which is called telerehabilitation, may be a more convenient and less expensive way of providing rehabilitation. Telerehabilitation may be used to improve a range of outcomes including physical functioning and mood. We searched for studies in June 2019 and identified 22 studies involving 1937 people after stroke. The studies used a wide range of treatments, including therapy programmes designed to improve arm function and ability to walk and programmes designed to provide counselling and support for people upon leaving hospital after stroke. As the studies were very different, it was rarely appropriate to combine results to determine overall effect. We found that people who received telerehabilitation had similar outcomes for activities of daily living function to those that received face-to-face therapy and those that received no therapy (usual care). At this point, not enough research has been done to show whether telerehabilitation is a more effective way to provide rehabilitation. Some studies report that telerehabilitation is less expensive to provide but information is lacking about cost-effectiveness. Only two trials reported on whether or not any adverse events had occurred; these trials found no serious adverse events were related to telerehabilitation. Further trials are required. The quality of the evidence was generally of low or moderate quality.",1063,Telerehabilitation; in-person rehabilitation; activities of daily living; stroke survivors; mobility; cognitive function; adverse events; depressive symptoms,What motivations for exploring telerehabilitation were highlighted by the study?,What were the main objectives of the telerehabilitation study?,Select all of the following that are colors,What were the findings regarding activities of daily living when comparing telerehabilitation to traditional methods?,"According to the summary, how did telerehabilitation impact participants' mood compared to face-to-face therapy?",To find a more convenient and less expensive way of providing rehabilitation.; To demonstrate the superiority of face-to-face therapy.; To establish telerehabilitation as a standard practice immediately.,To find a more convenient and less expensive way of providing rehabilitation.,To compare telerehabilitation with face-to-face therapy and usual care; To eliminate the need for stroke rehabilitation; To develop new medications for stroke,To compare telerehabilitation with face-to-face therapy and usual care,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Similar outcomes were found for both methods; Telerehabilitation was significantly more effective; Traditional methods were found to be ineffective,Similar outcomes were found for both methods,No significant changes in mood were reported; Telerehabilitation led to significant mood improvement; Face-to-face therapy worsened participants' mood,No significant changes in mood were reported

A thorough understanding of the current body of evidence regarding benefits and risks of this intervention is required. To assess the effectiveness and safety of convalescent plasma transfusion in the treatment of people with COVID-19; and to maintain the currency of the evidence using a living systematic review approach. To identify completed and ongoing studies, we searched the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease Research Database, MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, and the Epistemonikos COVID-19 L*OVE Platform. We searched monthly until 03 March 2022. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating convalescent plasma for COVID-19, irrespective of disease severity, age, gender or ethnicity. We excluded studies that included populations with other coronavirus diseases (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)), as well as studies evaluating standard immunoglobulin. We followed standard Cochrane methodology. To assess bias in included studies we used RoB 2. We used the GRADE approach to rate the certainty of evidence for the following outcomes: all-cause mortality at up to day 28, worsening and improvement of clinical status (for individuals with moderate to severe disease), hospital admission or death, COVID-19 symptoms resolution (for individuals with mild disease), quality of life, grade 3 or 4 adverse events, and serious adverse events. In this fourth review update version, we included 33RCTs with 24,861 participants, of whom 11,432 received convalescent plasma. Of these, nine studies are single-centre studies and 24 are multi-centre studies. Fourteen studies took place in America, eight in Europe, three in South-East Asia, two in Africa, two in western Pacific and three in eastern Mediterranean regions and one in multiple regions. We identified a further 49 ongoingstudies evaluating convalescent plasma, and 33 studies reporting as being completed. Individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and moderate to severe disease 29 RCTs investigated the use of convalescent plasma for 22,728 participants with moderate to severe disease. 23 RCTs with 22,020 participants compared convalescent plasma to placebo or standard care alone, five compared to standard plasma and one compared to human immunoglobulin. We evaluate subgroups on detection of antibodies detection, symptom onset, country income groups and several co-morbidities in the full text. Convalescent plasma versus placebo or standard care alone Convalescent plasma does not reduce all-cause mortality at up to day 28 (risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92 to 1.03; 220 per 1000; 21 RCTs, 19,021 participants; high-certainty evidence). It has little to no impact on need for invasive mechanical ventilation, or death (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.11; 296 per 1000; 6 RCTs, 14,477 participants; high-certainty evidence) and has no impact on whether participants are discharged from hospital (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.02; 665 per 1000; 6 RCTs, 12,721 participants; high-certainty evidence).

It has probably little to no effect on the risk of serious adverse events (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.44; 135 per 1000; 6 RCTs, 3901 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Convalescent plasma versus standard plasma We are uncertain whether convalescent plasma reduces or increases all-cause mortality at up to day 28 (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.19; 129 per 1000; 4 RCTs, 484 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether convalescent plasma reduces or increases the need for invasive mechanical ventilation, or death (RR 5.59, 95% CI 0.29 to 108.38; 311 per 1000; 1 study, 34 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and whether it reduces or increases the risk of serious adverse events (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.15; 236 per 1000; 3 RCTs, 327 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We did not identify any study reporting other key outcomes. Convalescent plasma versus human immunoglobulin Convalescent plasma may have little to no effect on all-cause mortality at up to day 28 (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.50; 464 per 1000; 1 study, 190 participants; low-certainty evidence). We did not identify any study reporting other key outcomes. Individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and mild disease We identified two RCTs reporting on 536 participants, comparing convalescent plasma to placebo or standard care alone, and two RCTs reporting on 1597 participants with mild disease, comparing convalescent plasma to standard plasma. Convalescent plasma versus placebo or standard care alone We are uncertain whether convalescent plasma reduces all-cause mortality at up to day 28 (odds ratio (OR) 0.36, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.46; 8 per 1000; 2 RCTs, 536 participants; very low-certainty evidence). It may have little to no effect on admission to hospital or death within 28 days (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.84; 117 per 1000; 1 RCT, 376 participants; low-certainty evidence), on time to COVID-19 symptom resolution (hazard ratio (HR) 1.05, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.30; 483 per 1000; 1 RCT, 376 participants; low-certainty evidence), on the risk of grades 3 and 4 adverse events (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.75 to 2.19; 144 per 1000; 1 RCT, 376 participants; low-certainty evidence) and the risk of serious adverse events (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.94; 133 per 1000; 1 RCT, 376 participants; low-certainty evidence). We did not identify any study reporting other key outcomes. Convalescent plasma versus standard plasma We are uncertain whether convalescent plasma reduces all-cause mortality at up to day 28 (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.75; 2 per 1000; 2 RCTs, 1597 participants; very low-certainty evidence). It probably reduces admission to hospital or death within 28 days (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.75; 36 per 1000; 2 RCTs, 1595 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Convalescent plasma may have little to no effect on initial symptom resolution at up to day 28 (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.27; 1 RCT, 416 participants; low-certainty evidence). We did not identify any study reporting other key outcomes. This is a living systematic review. We search monthly for new evidence and update the review when we identify relevant new evidence. For the comparison of convalescent plasma versus placebo or standard care alone, our certainty in the evidence that convalescent plasma for individuals with moderate to severe disease does not reduce mortality and has little to no impact on clinical improvement or worsening is high. It probably has little to no effect on SAEs. For individuals with mild disease, we have very-low to low certainty evidence for most primary outcomes and moderate certainty for hospital admission or death. There are 49 ongoing studies, and 33 studies reported as complete in a trials registry. Publication of ongoing studies might resolve some of the uncertainties around convalescent plasma therapy for people with asymptomatic or mild disease.","Convalescent plasma is plasma containing antibodies produced by the body as a defence against infection, taken from people who have recovered from COVID-19 and used to make treatment that can be given by a drip or injection; while generally well-tolerated, it can cause unwanted effects. We wanted to find out whether convalescent plasma is an effective treatment for people with confirmed COVID-19, looking at deaths from any cause after treatment, worsening of patients' condition measured by the number of people needing ventilator support or who died, improvement measured by hospital discharge, quality of life, and unwanted effects. We searched for studies worldwide that investigated convalescent plasma in people of any age, gender, ethnicity, and with mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19, pooled results when possible, and rated our confidence based on study methods and sizes. We found 33 studies with 24,861 participants, including 29 studies in moderate to severe COVID-19 and four in mild disease, mostly conducted in hospitals worldwide; the findings compare convalescent plasma with placebo or standard care. For people with moderate to severe COVID-19, convalescent plasma makes no difference to deaths within 28 days (about 225 in 1000 died vs 220 in 1000 given plasma), makes little to no difference in needing invasive mechanical ventilation or dying (287 in 1000 vs 296 in 1000), and makes no difference to being discharged from hospital (665 in 1000 in both groups). It probably makes no difference to serious unwanted effects (118 in 1000 vs 133 in 1000) and may result in no difference in quality of life. For people with mild COVID-19, convalescent plasma may result in no difference in deaths within 28 days (22 in 1000 on placebo/standard care vs 9 in 1000 on plasma), may result in no difference in admission to hospital or death within 28 days (112 in 1000 vs 117 in 1000), may result in no difference in the time until symptoms resolved, and may result in no difference in serious unwanted effects. The limitations of the evidence are that we are very confident in the evidence for deaths, worsening, and improvement in moderate to severe COVID-19 due to consistent high-quality studies, but confidence in other evidence for moderate, severe, and mild COVID-19 is limited because we could not identify enough consistent results; there is still little evidence on quality of life and for people with mild disease, and none for those without COVID-19 symptoms.",1108,Convalescent plasma; viral respiratory diseases; coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS); Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS); RoB 2; mechanical ventilation; quality of life; human immunoglobulin; SARS-CoV-2 infection,What inference can be drawn about the impact of convalescent plasma on deaths within 28 days for patients with moderate to severe COVID-19?,What is the estimated effectiveness of convalescent plasma in improving the quality of life for patients with moderate to severe COVID-19?,Select all of the following that are colors,What conclusion can be drawn about the unwanted effects of convalescent plasma therapy for moderate to severe COVID-19?,What hypothesis could be formulated for further studies to resolve uncertainties about convalescent plasma in asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 cases?,"Convalescent plasma significantly reduces mortality.; Convalescent plasma has no impact on mortality compared to placebo or standard care.; The evidence shows mixed results, making it inconclusive.",Convalescent plasma has no impact on mortality compared to placebo or standard care.,The plasma significantly improves quality of life.; There is little to no difference in quality of life compared to standard care.; The evidence on quality of life was robust and conclusive.,There is little to no difference in quality of life compared to standard care.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Convalescent plasma likely increases serious unwanted effects.; The therapy probably makes no difference in the occurrence of serious unwanted effects.; The therapy has a clear difference in reducing unwanted effects.,The therapy probably makes no difference in the occurrence of serious unwanted effects.,Convalescent plasma significantly enhances symptom resolution.; Further large-scale studies will clarify its impact on mild cases.; More randomised trials are unnecessary based on current evidence.,Further large-scale studies will clarify its impact on mild cases.
6314c1e76c3f71e2127f1976,interactive_3,Is favipiravir useful in treating people with COVID-19?,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to challenge the health workforce and societies worldwide. Favipiravir was suggested by some experts to be effective and safe to use in COVID-19. Although this drug has been evaluated in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), it is still unclear if it has a definite role in the treatment of COVID-19. The aim of this Cochrane Review was to assess the effects of favipiravir compared to no treatment, supportive treatment, or other experimental antiviral treatment in people with acute COVID-19. Researchers searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, MEDLINE, Embase, the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease, and three other databases up to 18 July 2023 for RCTs evaluating the efficacy of favipiravir in treating people with COVID-19. Using standard Cochrane methodological procedures and the GRADE approach, they included 25 trials that randomized 5750 adults (most under 60 years of age) across multiple countries, with most participants hospitalized with mild to moderate disease (89%). Twenty-two trials compared favipiravir to placebo or standard of care, two used lopinavir/ritonavir, and one used umifenovir; most regimens began with 1600 mg or 1800 mg twice daily on day one, followed by 600 mg to 800 mg twice daily for five to 14 days. The evidence remains very uncertain regarding whether favipiravir reduces all-cause mortality at 28 to 30 days or in-hospital (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.46; 11 trials, 3459 participants), or whether it reduces progression to invasive mechanical ventilation (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.09; 8 trials, 1383 participants). Favipiravir may make little to no difference in the need for hospital admission among ambulatory patients (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.46; 4 trials, 670 participants), and the evidence is very uncertain regarding time to clinical improvement (HR 1.13, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.83; 4 trials, 721 participants). It may also make little to no difference in progression to oxygen therapy (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.75; 2 trials, 543 participants). Favipiravir may lead to an increased incidence of adverse events overall (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.54; 18 trials, 4699 participants), but may result in little to no difference in serious adverse events attributable to the drug (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.42; 12 trials, 3317 participants). Overall, low- to very low-certainty evidence means that it is not known whether favipiravir is efficacious in people with COVID-19 illness of any severity or admission status, and while treatment may increase general adverse events, it may not increase serious adverse events.","What is favipiravir? Favipiravir is a medicine that can fight viruses. It is usually taken by mouth. Originally used for treating other viral infections, favipiravir has been suggested as a potential treatment for COVID-19 as it prevents the reproduction of the virus. Medical regulators have approved favipiravir for emergency use to treat people with COVID-19. What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out if favipiravir was better than no treatment, supportive treatment, or any other experimental antiviral treatment for people with COVID-19, in terms of death, need for a breathing machine (mechanical ventilation), and other outcomes. We also wanted to find out if favipiravir was associated with any unwanted effects. What did we do? We searched for studies that compared favipiravir with no treatment, supportive treatment, or other antiviral treatment in people with COVID-19 disease. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. What did we find? We found 25 relevant studies involving 5750 people. The studies were conducted in 13 different countries: Bahrain, Brazil, China, India, Iran, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, the UK, and the USA. Most people were under 60 years old and had mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms. What are the main results of our review?  We do not know if favipiravir reduces the number of people who die from COVID-19 when compared to dummy treatment, standard of care, or other antiviral medicines. The evidence supporting this is not very strong (derived from 11 studies involving 3459 people). It is also very unclear if favipiravir reduces the need for people to be put on ventilators compared to a dummy treatment or any other antiviral treatments (derived from 8 studies involving 1383 people). In people with mild symptoms, using favipiravir may not reduce the likelihood of needing hospitalization, but more research is needed to be sure (derived from 4 studies involving 670 people). Favipiravir has an unclear effect on the time it takes for people to improve, as defined by a reduction in their illness severity (derived from 4 studies involving 721 people).  Favipiravir seems to make very little difference in reducing the need for treatment with oxygen, compared to a dummy treatment or other antiviral treatment (derived from 2 studies involving 543 people). Favipiravir might lead to mild side effects (derived from 18 studies involving 4699 people) but doesn't seem to cause major or severe side effects (derived from 12 studies involving 3317 people). What are the limitations of the evidence? Our confidence in the evidence for using favipiravir is limited because people in the studies had different disease severities and the studies were of varying sizes and had inconsistent results.",1107,COVID-19 pandemic; SARS-CoV-2; favipiravir; all-cause mortality; invasive mechanical ventilation; ambulatory patients; oxygen therapy; adverse events; serious adverse events; lopinavir/ritonavir,"In evaluating the study outcomes, how should the inconsistent results influence future clinical guidelines regarding favipiravir?",Which methodological approaches from this review could be enhanced to better support favipiravir efficacy conclusions in future studies?,Select all of the following that are fruits,"Based on the plain-language summary, how could the clarity of favipiravir's effects on mechanical ventilation be improved?",Which outcome did the research hope to clarify regarding favipiravir's effect?,Inconsistent results suggest caution in widespread use without further research.; Inconsistencies indicate immediate adoption into treatment protocols.; They show consistent efficacy across all outcomes.,Inconsistent results suggest caution in widespread use without further research.,Only include studies with the most positive outcomes.; Increase uniformity in disease severity among participants.; Focus exclusively on small-scale trials to ensure manageability.,Increase uniformity in disease severity among participants.,dog; blue; grape,grape,By increasing the number of studies focusing on severe cases.; By completely excluding severe cases from trials.; By reducing the number of studies included in the analysis.,By increasing the number of studies focusing on severe cases.,Need for mechanical ventilation; Cure for COVID-19; Prevention of new infections,Need for mechanical ventilation
6314c1e76c3f71e2127f1976,interactive_4,Are exercises for strengthening breathing muscles effective for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease?,"Inspiratory muscle training (IMT) aims to improve respiratory muscle strength and endurance. Clinical trials have used different training protocols, devices, and respiratory measurements to assess its effectiveness. Current guidelines suggest a possible benefit of IMT, particularly in people with respiratory muscle weakness, but it remains unclear how clinically useful IMT is, especially when combined with pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). We evaluated the effect of IMT on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), both as a stand-alone intervention and when combined with PR. We searched major medical databases and clinical trial registries up to 20 October 2022 and reviewed reference lists of relevant studies. We included randomized controlled trials comparing IMT plus PR versus PR alone, and IMT versus control or sham, using any type of IMT delivery. We excluded trials using resistive devices without breathing-pattern control or with training loads under 30% of maximal inspiratory pressure. Standard Cochrane methods and the RoB 2 tool were used. Primary outcomes included dyspnea, functional exercise capacity, and health-related quality of life. We included 55 RCTs. Interventions varied widely in duration, training load, devices, session frequency, and PR program structure. Only eight trials had low risk of bias. In the comparison of PR plus IMT versus PR alone, we found 22 trials with 1446 participants. IMT added to PR did not improve dyspnea on the Borg scale or the mMRC scale, and effects did not reach clinically meaningful differences. The 6-minute walk distance increased by 5.95 meters but did not reach the threshold for clinical improvement. Subgroup analyses showed no significant differences based on training duration or baseline inspiratory pressure. St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire and COPD Assessment Test scores also did not show clinically meaningful improvements. PImax increased by 11.46 cmH?O but did not meet the minimum clinically important difference, and subgroup analyses again showed no clear modifiers of effect. One abstract reported minor, self-limited adverse effects. In the comparison of IMT versus control or sham, 37 trials with 1021 participants were included. IMT showed a trend toward improved Borg dyspnea scores, but evidence quality was very low. Eight studies using the BDI-TDI showed improvement only in the TDI total score. mMRC scores suggested possible improvement. IMT improved 6-minute walk distance by 35.71 meters, reaching moderate-certainty evidence. SGRQ total scores showed a modest effect in favor of IMT, but evidence was very low. CAT scores improved with IMT. PImax increased by 14.57 cmH?O but did not reach the clinically important threshold. Subgroup analyses again did not identify clear effect modifiers. No included trials reported adverse events. IMT may not improve dyspnea, functional exercise capacity, or quality of life when combined with PR, but IMT alone is likely to improve these outcomes. Whether greater effects occur in people with respiratory muscle weakness or with longer training durations remains uncertain.","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung condition in which the airways become blocked, causing shortness of breath and coughing. It typically develops after long-term exposure to irritating gases such as cigarette smoke and industrial chemicals. Strengthening the breathing muscles is thought to improve airflow and ease symptoms. Health professionals use different exercise approaches to help manage COPD. Some people follow general exercise and education programs to reduce symptoms and improve fitness and quality of life. Others perform breathing exercises using devices that strengthen the diaphragm and rib muscles by adding resistance; this is called inspiratory muscle training (IMT). These devices are also used by people with healthy lungs to improve athletic performance. We wanted to find out whether exercise combined with IMT works better than exercise alone, and whether IMT works better than no training or sham IMT, in improving breathlessness, physical fitness, and quality of life. (A sham device looks real but has no training effect, allowing a fair comparison.) We also wanted to check whether IMT causes any unwanted effects. We searched for studies comparing exercise plus IMT versus exercise alone, and IMT versus no training or sham IMT, then summarized the findings and evaluated the quality of the evidence. We found 22 studies with 1446 participants lasting from 2 to 24 weeks that compared exercise plus IMT to exercise alone. Exercise programs varied widely some used treadmill-only or cycling-only sessions, while others combined treadmill and cycling with muscle strengthening, stair climbing, and education. IMT devices and training durations also varied. Overall, adding IMT to exercise probably makes little to no difference in breathlessness, has unknown effects on physical fitness, may make little to no difference in quality of life, and probably makes little to no difference in breathing muscle strength. We also found 37 studies with 1021 participants lasting from 2 weeks to a year that compared IMT alone with no training or sham IMT. IMT protocols varied in devices, resistance levels, frequency, and supervision. IMT alone may reduce breathlessness on one measurement scale but shows unclear effects on two others; it probably improves physical fitness; it probably improves quality of life on one scale but shows unclear benefits on another; and it may make little to no difference to breathing muscle strength. These findings are limited by differences in training duration, devices, resistance levels, frequency of sessions, and exercise programs. Many studies were small, and some participants may have known which treatment they received.

The combination of metformin and sulphonylurea (M+S) is a widely used treatment. Whether M+S shows better or worse effects in comparison with other antidiabetic medications for people with T2DM is still controversial. To assess the effects of metformin and sulphonylurea (second- or third-generation) combination therapy for adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
We updated the search of a recent systematic review from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). The updated search included CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP. The date of the last search was March 2018. We searched manufacturers' websites and reference lists of included trials, systematic reviews, meta-analyses and health technology assessment reports. We asked investigators of the included trials for information about additional trials. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) randomising participants 18 years old or more with T2DM to M+S compared with metformin plus another glucose-lowering intervention or metformin monotherapy with a treatment duration of 52 weeks or more. Two review authors read all abstracts and full-text articles and records, assessed risk of bias and extracted outcome data independently. We used a random-effects model to perform meta-analysis, and calculated risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes, using 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for effect estimates. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE instrument. We included 32 RCTs randomising 28,746 people. Treatment duration ranged between one to four years. We judged none of these trials as low risk of bias for all 'Risk of bias' domains. Most important events per person were all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, serious adverse events (SAE), non-fatal stroke (NFS), non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) and microvascular complications. Most important comparisons were as follows: Five trials compared M+S (N = 1194) with metformin plus a glucagon-like peptide 1 analogue (N = 1675): all-cause mortality was 11/1057 (1%) versus 11/1537 (0.7%), risk ratio (RR) 1.15 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to 2.67); 3 trials; 2594 participants; low-certainty evidence; cardiovascular mortality 1/307 (0.3%) versus 1/302 (0.3%), low-certainty evidence; serious adverse events (SAE) 128/1057 (12.1%) versus 194/1537 (12.6%), RR 0.90 (95% CI 0.73 to 1.11); 3 trials; 2594 participants; very low-certainty evidence; non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) 2/549 (0.4%) versus 6/1026 (0.6%), RR 0.57 (95% CI 0.12 to 2.82); 2 trials; 1575 participants; very low-certainty evidence.

Eleven trials compared M+S (N = 3626) with metformin plus a thiazolidinedione (N = 3685): all-cause mortality was 123/3300 (3.7%) versus 114/3354 (3.4%), RR 1.09 (95% CI 0.85 to 1.40); 6 trials; 6654 participants; low-certainty evidence; cardiovascular mortality 37/2946 (1.3%) versus 41/2994 (1.4%), RR 0.78 (95% CI 0.36 to 1.67); 4 trials; 5940 participants; low-certainty evidence; SAE 666/3300 (20.2%) versus 671/3354 (20%), RR 1.01 (95% CI 0.93 to 1.11); 6 trials; 6654 participants; very low-certainty evidence; NFS 20/1540 (1.3%) versus 16/1583 (1%), RR 1.29 (95% CI 0.67 to 2.47); P = 0.45; 2 trials; 3123 participants; very low-certainty evidence; non-fatal MI 25/1841 (1.4%) versus 21/1877 (1.1%), RR 1.21 (95% CI 0.68 to 2.14); P = 0.51; 3 trials; 3718 participants; very low-certainty evidence; three trials (3123 participants) reported no microvascular complications (very low-certainty evidence). Three trials compared M+S (N = 462) with metformin plus a glinide (N = 476): one person died in each intervention group (3 trials; 874 participants; low-certainty evidence); no cardiovascular mortality (2 trials; 446 participants; low-certainty evidence); SAE 34/424 (8%) versus 27/450 (6%), RR 1.68 (95% CI 0.54 to 5.21); P = 0.37; 3 trials; 874 participants; low-certainty evidence; no NFS (1 trial; 233 participants; very low-certainty evidence); non-fatal MI 2/215 (0.9%) participants in the M+S group; 2 trials; 446 participants; low-certainty evidence; no microvascular complications (1 trial; 233 participants; low-certainty evidence). Four trials compared M+S (N = 2109) with metformin plus a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor (N = 3032): all-cause mortality was 13/2107 (0.6%) versus 19/3027 (0.6%), RR 0.96 (95% CI 0.44 to 2.09); 4 trials; 5134 participants; very low-certainty evidence; cardiovascular mortality 4/1327 (0.3%) versus 6/2262 (0.3%), RR 1.22 (95% CI 0.33 to 4.41); 3 trials; 3589 participants; very low-certainty evidence; SAE 315/2107 (15.5%) versus 375/3027 (12.4%), RR 1.02 (95% CI 0.76 to 1.37); 4 trials; 5134 participants; very low-certainty evidence; NFS 3/919 (0.3%) versus 7/1856 (0.4%), RR 0.87 (95% CI 0.22 to 3.34); 2 trials; 2775 participants; very low-certainty evidence; non-fatal MI 7/890 (0.8%) versus 8/1374 (0.6%), RR 1.43 (95% CI 0.49 to 4.18; 2 trials); 2264 participants; very low-certainty evidence; amputation of lower extremity 1/437 (0.2%) versus 1/888 (0.1%); very low-certainty evidence. Trials reported more hypoglycaemic episodes with M+S combination compared to all other metformin-antidiabetic agent combinations. Results for M+S versus metformin monotherapy were inconclusive. There were no RCTs comparing M+S with metformin plus insulin. We identified nine ongoing trials and two trials are awaiting assessment. Together these trials will include approximately 16,631 participants. There is inconclusive evidence whether M+S combination therapy compared with metformin plus another glucose-lowering intervention results in benefit or harm for most patient-important outcomes (mortality, SAEs, macrovascular and microvascular complications) with the exception of hypoglycaemia (more harm for M+S combination). No RCT reported on health-related quality of life.","We wanted to investigate the effects of the combination of the antidiabetic medications metformin plus sulphonylurea compared with other antidiabetic interventions in people with type 2 diabetes.
Many people with type 2 diabetes are treated with several types of glucose-lowering drugs such as 'sulphonylureas' (for example glibenclamide or glyburide, glipizide and gliclazide). These medications lower blood glucose by stimulating the secretion of insulin in the body, thereby increasing insulin levels in the blood. Another antidiabetic agent, metformin lowers blood glucose by improving the body's ability to make insulin work better (insulin sensitivity). The combination of metformin plus sulphonylurea is widely used. We wanted to investigate the effects of metformin plus sulphonylurea on patient-important outcomes such as complications of diabetes (for example kidney and eye disease, heart attacks, strokes), death from any cause, health-related quality of life and side effects of the medications. We found 32 randomised controlled studies (clinical trials where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups), which allocated 28,746 people with type 2 diabetes to either metformin plus sulphonylurea or a comparator group. The comparator groups consisted of the following types of antidiabetic medications in addition to metformin: five studies with glucagon-like peptide 1 analogues, nine studies with dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 inhibitors, 11 studies with thiazolidinediones, three studies with glinides and four studies with sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors. Participants of the studies were treated for between one and four years. There were big differences between people taking part in the studies, especially with regard to age, how long people had diabetes and whether diabetes complications were present at the start of the study. All included studies had deficiencies in the way they were conducted or how study authors reported the results. For individual comparisons of the antidiabetic medications the number of participants was often small, resulting in a high risk of random error (play of chance).",1009,type 2 diabetes mellitus; metformin; sulphonylurea; glucose-lowering intervention; hypoglycaemic episodes; microvascular complications; risk ratio (RR); cardiovascular mortality; serious adverse events (SAE); non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI),What conclusions can be drawn about the certainty of the evidence regarding the use of M+S in comparison to other therapies?,What was the main motivation for the study on metformin plus sulphonylurea?,Select the items that are animals,Which antidiabetic medication combination was a focus of this study?,What are some important outcomes assessed in the study?,The evidence is generally low-certainty due to study design deficiencies.; The evidence is conclusive and reliable for clinical recommendations.; The certainty varies significantly across different comparisons.,The evidence is generally low-certainty due to study design deficiencies.; The certainty varies significantly across different comparisons.,To determine side effects of metformin plus sulphonylurea; To investigate effects compared with other antidiabetic interventions; To find a cure for type 2 diabetes,To investigate effects compared with other antidiabetic interventions,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,Metformin plus insulin; Metformin plus sulphonylurea; Metformin plus diet modification,Metformin plus sulphonylurea,Health-related quality of life; Increase in muscle mass; Complications of diabetes,Health-related quality of life; Complications of diabetes
6314c1e76c3f71e2127f1976,finetuned_5,Nutritional therapy for reducing disability and improving activities of daily living in people after stroke,"Stroke patients often face disabilities that significantly interfere with their daily lives. Poor nutritional status is a common issue amongst these patients, and malnutrition can severely impact their functional recovery post-stroke. Therefore, nutritional therapy is crucial in managing stroke outcomes. However, its effects on disability, activities of daily living (ADL), and other critical outcomes have not been fully explored.
To evaluate the effects of nutritional therapy on reducing disability and improving ADL in patients after stroke.
We searched the trial registers of the Cochrane Stroke Group, CENTRAL, MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), CINAHL (from 1982), and AMED (from 1985) to 19 February 2024. We also searched trials and research registries (ClinicalTrials.gov, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform) and reference lists of articles.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared nutritional therapy with placebo, usual care, or one type of nutritional therapy in people after stroke. Nutritional therapy was defined as the administration of supplemental nutrients, including energy, protein, amino acids, fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals, through oral, enteral, or parenteral methods. As a comparator, one type of nutritional therapy refers to all forms of nutritional therapies, excluding the specific nutritional therapy defined for use in the intervention group.
We used Cochrane's Screen4Me workflow to assess the initial search results. Two review authors independently screened references that met the inclusion criteria, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias and the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We calculated the mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous data and the odds ratio (OR) for dichotomous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed heterogeneity using the I2statistic. The primary outcomes were disability and ADL. We also assessed gait, nutritional status, all-cause mortality, quality of life, hand and leg muscle strength, cognitive function, physical performance, stroke recurrence, swallowing function, neurological impairment, and the development of complications (adverse events) as secondary outcomes.
We identified 52 eligible RCTs involving 11,926 participants. Thirty-six studies were conducted in the acute phase, 10 in the subacute phase, three in the acute and subacute phases, and three in the chronic phase. Twenty-three studies included patients with ischaemic stroke, three included patients with haemorrhagic stroke, three included patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH), and 23 included patients with ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke including SAH. There were 25 types of nutritional supplements used as an intervention. The number of studies that assessed disability and ADL as outcomes were nine and 17, respectively. For the intervention using oral energy and protein supplements, which was a primary intervention in this review, six studies were included. The results for the seven outcomes focused on (disability, ADL, body weight change, all-cause mortality, gait speed, quality of life, and incidence of complications (adverse events)) were as follows: There was no evidence of a difference in reducing disability when 'good status' was defined as an mRS score of 0 to 2 (for 'good status': OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.10; 1 RCT, 4023 participants; low certainty evidence). Oral energy and protein supplements may improve ADL as indicated by an increase in the FIM motor score, but the evidence is very uncertain (MD 8.74, 95% CI 5.93 to 11.54; 2 RCTs, 165 participants; very low certainty evidence). Oral energy and protein supplements may increase body weight, but the evidence is very uncertain (MD 0.90, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.58; 3 RCTs, 205 participants; very low-certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in reducing all-cause mortality (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.14 to 2.28; 2 RCTs, 4065 participants; low-certainty evidence). For gait speed and quality of life, no study was identified. With regard to incidence of complications (adverse events), there was no evidence of a difference in the incidence of infections, including pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and septicaemia (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.20 to 2.30; 1 RCT, 42 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The intervention was associated with an increased incidence of diarrhoea compared to usual care (OR 4.29, 95% CI 1.98 to 9.28; 1 RCT, 4023 participants; low-certainty evidence) and the occurrence of hyperglycaemia or hypoglycaemia (OR 15.6, 95% CI 4.84 to 50.23; 1 RCT, 4023 participants; low-certainty evidence).
We are uncertain about the effect of nutritional therapy, including oral energy and protein supplements and other supplements identified in this review, on reducing disability and improving ADL in people after stroke. Various nutritional interventions were assessed for the outcomes in the included studies, and almost all studies had small sample sizes. This led to challenges in conducting meta-analyses and reduced the precision of the evidence. Moreover, most of the studies had issues with the risk of bias, especially in terms of the absence of blinding and unclear information. Regarding adverse events, the intervention with oral energy and protein supplements was associated with a higher number of adverse events, such as diarrhoea, hyperglycaemia, and hypoglycaemia, compared to usual care. However, the quality of the evidence was low. Given the low certainty of most of the evidence in our review, further research is needed. Future research should focus on targeted nutritional interventions to reduce disability and improve ADL based on a theoretical rationale in people after stroke and there is a need for improved methodology and reporting.","A stroke occurs when the blood supply to part of your brain is interrupted or reduced. There are three main types of strokes: an ischaemic stroke, which happens when a blood clot blocks or narrows an artery leading to the brain; a haemorrhagic stroke, which occurs when a blood vessel in the brain bursts, causing bleeding in the brain; and a subarachnoid haemorrhage, which occurs when there is bleeding in the space between the brain and the surrounding membrane (subarachnoid space). Nutrition therapy is an intervention using nutrients such as protein, vitamins, and energy for daily meals and/or between meals, and includes nutrition care based on the condition of each patient. People with and after a disease often receive nutritional therapy. Stroke patients easily get malnutrition because they do not receive enough energy and nutrients as a result of impairments. Stroke patients often experience physical and cognitive issues, and nutritional status may affect their improvement. We wanted to find out whether nutritional therapy reduces disability and improves daily activities in people after stroke.
We searched the medical literature for all randomised trials conducted on nutritional therapy in people after stroke. We also assessed whether nutritional therapy is safe in terms of unwanted effects. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We identified 52 studies that involved 11,926 participants. Thirty-six studies with acute stroke patients were conducted (within 14 days from stroke onset), 10 with subacute stroke patients (within 6 months, from 14 days after stroke onset), three with acute and subacute stroke patients, and three with chronic stroke patients (after 6 months from stroke onset). The stroke type investigated was ischaemic in 23 studies, haemorrhagic in three studies, subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) in three studies, and ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke including SAH in 23 studies. We identified 25 types of nutritional intervention in this review. The number of studies that assessed disability and ADL as outcomes were 9 and 17, respectively.
For the primary intervention of using oral energy and protein supplements, we identified six studies. We found that nutritional therapy using oral energy and protein supplements:
- may not reduce disability; however, the evidence is uncertain
- may improve daily activities; however, the evidence is very uncertain
For other outcomes, nutritional therapy using oral energy and protein supplements:
- may improve nutritional status in weight gain; however, the evidence is very uncertain
- may not decrease the risk of death from any cause; however, the evidence is uncertain
- were associated with an increased incidence of both diarrhoea and either hyperglycaemia (a condition where there is too much sugar (glucose) in the blood) or hypoglycaemia (a condition where there is too little sugar (glucose) in the blood); however, the evidence is uncertain
We did not find any studies with oral energy and protein supplements that reported walking speed and quality of life.
We are not confident of the evidence for reducing disability and improving daily activities for the following reasons:
- Patients in most studies were aware of the intervention they were receiving.
- Healthcare providers and outcome assessors were aware of the interventions the patients were receiving.
- Most studies that assessed ADL(activities of daily living) did not describe their methods in sufficient detail.
- The effect may differ according to stroke type, time from stroke onset, and nutritional status at the start of nutritional therapy, but we could not assess those differences sufficiently due to the small number of studies.",1064,Nutritional therapy; ischaemic stroke; enteral methods; parenteral methods; neurological impairment; functional recovery post-stroke; all-cause mortality; incidence of complications; nutritional status; oral energy and protein supplements,What are the main types of stroke mentioned in the summary?,Summarize the primary goal of the study about nutritional therapy for stroke patients.,Select all of the following that are colors,Identify adverse events associated with oral energy and protein supplements mentioned in the study.,Describe the types of nutritional therapy interventions included in the review.,Ischaemic stroke; Cardiac stroke; Haemorrhagic stroke,Ischaemic stroke; Haemorrhagic stroke,To reduce disability and improve daily activities; To develop new medications for stroke; To create a new diet plan for all patients,To reduce disability and improve daily activities,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Diarrhoea; Increased walking speed; Either hyperglycaemia or hypoglycaemia,Diarrhoea; Either hyperglycaemia or hypoglycaemia,Nutrients for daily and between meal care; Psychological counseling; Surgical interventions,Nutrients for daily and between meal care
6314c1e76c3f71e2127f1976,finetuned_6,Insulin detemir versus insulin glargine for type 2 diabetes mellitus,"Chronically elevated blood glucose levels are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Many diabetes patients will eventually require insulin treatment to maintain good glycaemic control. There are still uncertainties about the optimal insulin treatment regimens for type 2 diabetes, but the long-acting insulin analogues seem beneficial. Several reviews have compared either insulin detemir or insulin glargine to NPH insulin, but research directly comparing both insulin analogues is limited.
To assess the effects of insulin detemir and insulin glargine compared with each other in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, online registries of ongoing trials and abstract books. Date of last search was January 2011.
All randomised controlled trials comparing insulin detemir with insulin glargine with a duration of 12 weeks or longer were included.
Two authors independently selected the studies and extracted the data. Pooling of studies by means of random-effects meta-analysis was performed.
This review examined four trials lasting 24 to 52 weeks involving 2250 people randomised to either insulin detemir or glargine. Overall, risk of bias of the evaluated studies was high. Insulin glargine was dosed once-daily in the evening. Insulin detemir was initiated once-daily in the evening with the option of an additional dose in the morning in three studies and initiated twice-daily in one study. Of randomised patients 13.6% to 57.2% were injecting insulin detemir twice-daily at the end of trial. Glycaemic control, measured by glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and HbA1c equal to or less than 7% with or without hypoglycaemia, did not differ statistically significantly between treatment groups. The results showed no significant differences in overall, nocturnal and severe hypoglycaemia between treatment groups. Insulin detemir was associated with less weight gain. Treatment with insulin glargine resulted in a lower daily basal insulin dose and a lower number of injection site reactions. There was no significant difference in the variability of FPG or glucose values in 24-hour profiles between treatment groups. It was not possible to draw conclusions on quality of life, costs or mortality. Only one trial reported results on health-related quality of life and showed no significant differences between treatment groups.
Our analyses suggest that there is no clinically relevant difference in efficacy or safety between insulin detemir and insulin glargine for targeting hyperglycaemia. However, to achieve the same glycaemic control insulin detemir was often injected twice-daily in a higher dose but with less weight gain, while insulin glargine was injected once-daily, with somewhat fewer injection site reactions.","The two long-acting insulin analogues (artificial insulins), insulin detemir or insulin glargine differ in their mechanism of attaining protracted action, leading to possible differences in glycaemic control and safety outcomes. Several studies have compared either insulin detemir or insulin glargine to NPH (Neutral Protamin Hagedorn) insulin. Research directly comparing both long-acting insulin analogues is limited.
Our aim was to systematically review the efficacy and safety of insulin detemir and insulin glargine in head-to-head studies in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Four studies investigated a total of 2250 people. Trials lasted between 24 and 52 weeks. Overall, risk of bias of the evaluated studies was high. Our analysis of these intermediate term trials comparing insulin detemir with insulin glargine showed that these two insulins were equally effective in achieving and maintaining glycaemic control (glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)). There were no differences in overall, nocturnal and severe hypoglycaemia when comparing insulin detemir to insulin glargine. Insulin detemir was associated with significantly less weight gain (one study showing a difference of 0.9 kg). Treatment with insulin glargine resulted in a lower daily basal insulin dose and a lower number of injection site reactions (1.8% of patients treated with insulin detemir compared to 0.4% of patients treated with insulin glargine had injection side reactions).
There was no difference in the variability of fasting glucose levels or the variability of glucose values of 24-hour profiles between the two treatment groups.
From the retrieved trials it was not possible to draw conclusions on the effects of these two insulins on quality of life, their costs or on the number of fatalities. Only one trial reported results on health-related quality of life and showed no significant differences between treatment groups.
Our analyses suggest that there is no clinically relevant difference in the efficacy or the safety between the use of insulin detemir and insulin glargine for treating type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, to achieve the same glycaemic control insulin detemir was often injected twice-daily in a higher dose but with less weight gain, while insulin glargine was only injected once-daily, with somewhat fewer injection site reactions.",1008,insulin glargine; insulin detemir; type 2 diabetes mellitus; glycaemic control; hypoglycaemia; glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c); injection site reactions; fasting plasma glucose (FPG); insulin treatment regimens; health-related quality of life,How did the different dosing schedules of insulin detemir and insulin glargine contribute to the overall findings of the study?,How does the study's conclusion on the efficacy equivalence of insulin detemir and insulin glargine impact future research directions?,Select all of the following that are colors,To what extent do the findings on injection site reactions influence the comparative safety evaluation of insulin detemir and insulin glargine?,Summarize the finding related to weight gain between the two insulin treatments.,The dosing differences were irrelevant to the glycaemic control outcomes.; Insulin detemir required more frequent injections but resulted in less weight gain.; Insulin glargine's once-daily dosing led to a higher risk of injection site reactions.,Insulin detemir required more frequent injections but resulted in less weight gain.,It suggests that research should focus on personalized treatment plans based on patient preference.; It indicates the need for more studies comparing these insulins with newer analogues.; It eliminates the necessity for any further comparative studies on these two insulins.,It suggests that research should focus on personalized treatment plans based on patient preference.; It indicates the need for more studies comparing these insulins with newer analogues.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,The lower rate of reactions with insulin glargine suggests it may be preferable for patients concerned about injection discomfort.; The similarity in injection site reactions indicates there is no safety difference.; The difference in injection site reactions is statistically but not clinically significant.,The lower rate of reactions with insulin glargine suggests it may be preferable for patients concerned about injection discomfort.,Insulin detemir was associated with significantly less weight gain.; Insulin glargine resulted in more weight gain.; Both insulins caused the same amount of weight gain.,Insulin detemir was associated with significantly less weight gain.
6314c1e76c3f71e2127f1976,finetuned_6,Immunosuppressive treatment for adults with idiopathic membranous nephropathy,"Primary membranous nephropathy (PMN) is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults, and without treatment about one-third of patients experience spontaneous remission, one-third have persistent proteinuria, and one-third progress to end?stage kidney disease (ESKD) within 10 years. Immunosuppressive therapy is used to protect kidney function in patients who do not improve with supportive treatment or who present with severe nephrotic syndrome, but the relative safety and effectiveness of different treatments have been unclear. This updated review included 65 studies involving 3807 adults with PMN and found that, compared with placebo or no immunosuppression, immunosuppressive therapy probably reduces the risk of progressing to ESKD, increases the likelihood of complete or partial remission, and lowers the number of people whose serum creatinine doubles, though it probably makes little or no difference to mortality. However, immunosuppressive therapy may increase relapse after remission and may increase temporary or permanent treatment discontinuation due to adverse effects, while its effects on infection and malignancy remain uncertain. Oral alkylating agents with or without steroids may reduce the risk of ESKD and may increase remission rates but also may lead to more treatment?related adverse events, and their effects on relapse, creatinine progression, infection, and malignancy remain uncertain. Evidence for calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus or cyclosporine), with or without steroids, was very uncertain, including whether they affect remission, relapse, ESKD, or adverse events. When calcineurin inhibitors were compared to alkylating agents, they appeared similarly effective for achieving remission but may result in higher relapse rates, though the overall certainty of evidence was low to moderate. Other treatments such as azathioprine, mizoribine, adrenocorticotropic hormone, traditional Chinese medicines, and rituximab had insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions. Overall, immunosuppressive therapy appears more effective than non-immunosuppressive management for inducing remission and reducing progression to ESKD, but this must be weighed against higher risks of adverse effects, and the evidence base remains limited by small sample sizes, high risk of bias, and inadequate follow-up. Alkylating agents combined with corticosteroids show both short- and long-term benefits but also higher toxicity, calcineurin inhibitors show similar efficacy but uncertain long-term safety, and biologics such as rituximab require further large, high-quality trials to determine their role.","Primary membranous nephropathy (PMN) is an autoimmune disease, where the body's immune system attacks the kidneys. The term ""primary"" is used to describe membranous nephropathy that is not caused by another disease in the body. PMN is a leading cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults. Nephrotic syndrome is a condition, where the membrane of the kidney is damaged and becomes permeable for proteins. Primary membranous nephropathy is diagnosed through findings in a kidney biopsy and the presence of nephrotic syndrome. PMN is not harmful in about one-third of patients, who will have a spontaneous ""complete remission"", which means that the disease will resolve by itself. However, about another one third will experience spontaneous remission but will have some protein in the urine that continues with normal kidney function. These patients usually only require supportive treatments that do not interact with the immune system. Without treatment, about 15% to 50% of patients progress to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) within 10 years. In some patients, PMN can be severe or continues to get worse even after using 6 months of supportive treatments. In these patients, extra treatment that dampens the activity of the immune system may be used to reduce damage to the kidney. It is not clear which of these treatment(s) is the most helpful and what side effects can occur. Therefore, the duration and intensity of immunosuppressive treatment need to be balanced against possible side effects. There are different classes of drugs used in immunosuppressive therapy. These drugs may or may not be combined with corticosteroids (drugs based on the body's stress response hormone cortisol). We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant specialised register up to 1 April 2021. We have combined studies to compare different treatment regimens with immunosuppressive therapy to assess which treatments help to treat patients with PMN and nephrotic syndrome with the least side effects. This review identified sixty-five studies with 3807 patients. Different types of immunosuppressive treatment include alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil), calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus and cyclosporine), antimetabolites (mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine), biologicals (e.g. rituximab) and adrenocorticotropic hormone. These drugs may or may not be combined with corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone), which also suppresses the immune system. After combining the results of available studies together, we found that compared with no treatment, supportive treatment or steroids alone, the use of immunosuppressive treatment probably reduced the number of patients who progressed to ESKD by about 40% and increased the number of patients that achieved complete remission. However, immunosuppressive treatment may lead to more adverse events, which can cause treatment to be stopped or lead to the patients needing to go to hospital. The different drugs that can be used in the immunosuppressive treatment were also examined in our review. We found that alkylating agents probably increases complete remission but may lead to more adverse events. We are uncertain whether alkylating agents increase infection or cancer. Based on the currently available evidence, the effectiveness of using calcineurin inhibitors is still unclear, but there is low certainty of the evidence, that CNI may lead to similar remission rates compared to alkylating agents.
Furthermore, other treatment options such as mycophenolate mofetil, adrenocorticotropic hormone, rituximab and others have only been examined in a few studies. There is not enough data to draw final conclusions on the use of these treatments in adults with PMN and nephrotic syndrome. The treatment of patients with PMN and nephrotic syndrome with immunosuppressive therapy compared to no treatment or supportive therapy alone probably protects the kidney but may increase side effects. A combination of immunosuppressive therapy with steroids may decrease disease activity and the use of alkylating agent combined with steroids probably has the short-term and long-term benefits of limiting damage to the kidney. Other therapies such as calcineurin inhibitors, mycophenolate mofetil, rituximab and adrenocorticotropic hormone have less certainty regarding their safety and effectiveness from these studies.",1086,Primary membranous nephropathy; nephrotic syndrome; immunosuppressive therapy; end-stage kidney disease; proteinuria; spontaneous remission; serum creatinine; alkylating agents; calcineurin inhibitors; rituximab,What is primary membranous nephropathy (PMN) primarily characterized by?,"In the context of PMN, what does spontaneous remission imply?",Select all of the following that are fruits,Which type of PMN patients might require immunosuppressive therapy?,What is a primary goal of immunosuppressive therapy in PMN treatment?,An autoimmune attack on the kidneys; A viral infection affecting the kidneys; A genetic disorder affecting the kidneys,An autoimmune attack on the kidneys,The disease resolves by itself; Immediate need for immunosuppressive therapy; Progression to end-stage kidney disease,The disease resolves by itself,dog; blue; grape,grape,Patients with spontaneous complete remission; Patients with severe or worsening PMN; All patients with nephrotic syndrome,Patients with severe or worsening PMN,To reduce the progression to end-stage kidney disease; To increase proteinuria; To eliminate the need for biopsy,To reduce the progression to end-stage kidney disease
62e02660c3ef175825ab7655,static_1,Interventions to prevent or reduce kidney complications in people with sickle cell disease,"Sickle cell disease (SCD), one of the commonest severe monogenic disorders, is caused by the inheritance of two abnormal haemoglobin (beta-globin) genes. SCD can cause severe pain, significant end-organ damage, pulmonary complications, and premature death. Kidney disease is a frequent and potentially severe complication in people with SCD. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined as abnormalities of kidney structure or function present for more than three months. Sickle cell nephropathy refers to the spectrum of kidney complications in SCD. Glomerular damage is a cause of microalbuminuria and can develop at an early age in children with SCD, with increased prevalence in adulthood. In people with sickle cell nephropathy, outcomes are poor as a result of the progression to proteinuria and chronic kidney insufficiency. Up to 12% of people who develop sickle cell nephropathy will develop end-stage renal disease. This is an update of a review first published in 2017. To assess the effectiveness of any intervention for preventing or reducing kidney complications or chronic kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease. Possible interventions include red blood cell transfusions, hydroxyurea, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), either alone or in combination. We searched for relevant trials in the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, seven other databases, and two other trials registers. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing interventions to prevent or reduce kidney complications or CKD in people with SCD. We applied no restrictions related to outcomes examined, language, or publication status. Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility, extracted data, assessed the risk of bias, and assessed the certainty of the evidence (GRADE). We included three RCTs with 385 participants. We rated the certainty of the evidence as low to very low across different outcomes according to GRADE methodology, downgrading for risk of bias concerns, indirectness, and imprecision. Hydroxyurea versus placebo One RCT published in 2011 compared hydroxyurea to placebo in 193 children aged nine to 18 months. We are unsure if hydroxyurea compared to placebo reduces or prevents progression of kidney disease assessed by change in glomerular filtration rate (mean difference (MD) 0.58 mL/min /1.73 m2, 95% confidence interval (CI) -14.60 to 15.76; 142 participants; very low certainty). Hydroxyurea compared to placebo may improve the ability to concentrate urine (MD 42.23 mOsm/kg, 95% CI 12.14 to 72.32; 178 participants; low certainty), and may make little or no difference to SCD-related serious adverse events, including acute chest syndrome (risk ratio (RR) 0.39, 99% CI 0.13 to 1.16; 193 participants; low certainty), painful crisis (RR 0.68, 99% CI 0.45 to 1.02; 193 participants; low certainty); and hospitalisations (RR 0.83, 99% CI 0.68 to 1.01; 193 participants; low certainty). No deaths occurred in either trial arm and the RCT did not report quality of life. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors versus placebo One RCT published in 1998 compared an ACEI (captopril) to placebo in 22 adults with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. We are unsure if captopril compared to placebo reduces proteinuria (MD -124.10 to 26.10; 22 participants; very low certainty). We are unsure if captopril reduces or prevents kidney disease as measured by creatinine clearance; the trial authors stated that creatinine clearance remained constant over six months in both groups, but provided no comparative data (very low certainty). The RCT did not report serious adverse events, all-cause mortality, or quality of life. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors versus vitamin C One RCT published in 2020 compared an ACEI (lisinopril)with vitamin C in 170 children aged one to 18 years with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. It reported no data we could analyse. We are unsure if lisinopril compared to vitamin C reduces proteinuria in this population: the large drop in microalbuminuria in both arms of the trial after only one month on treatment may have been due to an overestimation of microalbuminuria at baseline rather than a true effect. The RCT did not report serious adverse events, all-cause mortality, or quality of life. We are unsure if hydroxyurea improves glomerular filtration rate or reduces hyperfiltration in children aged nine to 18 months, but it may improve their ability to concentrate urine and may make little or no difference to the incidence of acute chest syndrome, painful crises, and hospitalisations. We are unsure if ACEI compared to placebo has any effect on preventing or reducing kidney complications in adults with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. We are unsure if ACEI compared to vitamin C has any effect on preventing or reducing kidney complications in children with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. No RCTs assessed red blood cell transfusions or any combined interventions to prevent or reduce kidney complications. Due to lack of evidence, we cannot comment on the management of children aged over 18 months or adults with any known genotype of SCD. We have identified a lack of adequately designed and powered studies, although we found four ongoing trials since the last version of this review. Only one ongoing trial addresses renal function as a primary outcome in the short term, but such interventions have long-term effects. Trials of hydroxyurea, ACEIs or red blood cell transfusion in older children and adults are urgently needed to determine any effect on prevention or reduction of kidney complications in people with SCD.","SCD is a serious inherited blood disorder where the red blood cells, which carry oxygen around the body, develop abnormally. Normal red blood cells are flexible and disc-shaped, but sickled cells are rigid and crescent-shaped, and stickier than normal red blood cells. This can lead to blockage of blood vessels, resulting in tissue and organ damage and episodes of severe pain. The abnormal cells are fragile and break apart easily, which leads to a decreased number of red blood cells, known as anaemia.Kidney complications can start at an early age in children with SCD and are common in adults with the condition. Kidney complications leading to kidney protein leak and chronic kidney disease can be severe, with serious effects on health. Severe complications include the need for dialysis (a procedure to remove waste products and excess fluid from the blood when the kidneys stop working properly) or a kidney transplant. Identifying therapies that can prevent or slow down the decline in kidney function in people with SCD is critical for improving health outcomes. The evidence is current to 22 September 2022. We found three randomised controlled trials, which enroled a total of 385 people. One trial, published in 2011, compared the drug hydroxyurea (which helps to maintain the shape and flexibility of red blood cells), to placebo (dummy treatment) in 193 children aged nine to 18 months. The second trial, published in 1998, compared captopril (a drug used to treat high blood pressure) to placebo in 22 adults with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria (high levels of protein in the urine). The third trial, published in 2020, compared lisinopril (a drug used to treat high blood pressure) to vitamin C in 170 children aged one to 18 years. Two trials received government funding; it was unclear how the third trial was funded. We have little or very little confidence in the evidence because we only found three trials, and they had specific populations (only children or only adults), few participants, and wide variations in results.",1089,Sickle cell disease; monogenic disorders; haemoglobin; chronic kidney disease; sickle cell nephropathy; microalbuminuria; end-stage renal disease; glomerular filtration rate; acute chest syndrome; painful crisis,What condition does sickle cell disease primarily affect?,Identify a key characteristic of red blood cells in people with SCD.,Select the items that are animals,What is the main purpose of the reviewed trials in the study?,What serious kidney complication can arise from SCD?,Red blood cells; White blood cells; Blood platelets,Red blood cells,Flexible and disc-shaped; Rigid and crescent-shaped; Irregular and square-shaped,Rigid and crescent-shaped,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,To prevent kidney protein leak; To slow kidney function decline; To cure SCD,To slow kidney function decline,Kidney stones; Need for dialysis or kidney transplant; Urinary tract infections,Need for dialysis or kidney transplant
62e02660c3ef175825ab7655,static_2,"Does cardiovascular training relieve cancer-related fatigue before, during, or after anticancer therapy?","To evaluate the effects of cardiovascular training on cancer-related fatigue (CRF), quality of life (QoL), adverse events, anxiety, and depression in people with cancer, with regard to their stage of anticancer therapy (before, during, or after), up to 12 weeks, up to six months, or longer, postintervention.
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov and World Health Organization ICTRP to identify studies that are included in the review. The latest search date was October 2023.
Moderate-certainty evidence shows that cardiovascular training by people with cancer during their anticancer therapy slightly reduces short-term CRF and results in little to no difference in short-term QoL. We do not know whether cardiovascular training increases or decreases medium-term CRF/QoL, and long-term CRF/QoL. There is very low-certainty evidence (due to heterogeneous definitions, reporting and measurement) evaluating whether the training increases or decreases adverse events. In people with cancer who perform cardiovascular training after anticancer therapy, we are uncertain about the effects on short-term CRF/QoL, long-term CRF/QoL, and adverse events. We identified a lack of evidence concerning cardiovascular training before anticancer therapy and on safety outcomes. The 36 ongoing and 12 completed, but unpublished, studies could help close this gap, and could contribute to improving the effect estimates and certainty.
This Cochrane review was funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research of Germany, grant number: FKZ 01KG2017.","What is cancer-related fatigue? Cancer-related fatigue is an extreme feeling of tiredness over a long period of time. It can be caused by cancer treatment or the cancer itself. It is the most common symptom among people with cancer. It cannot be relieved by rest, and it affects the body and mind. What is cardiovascular training? Cardiovascular training is any activity that uses the large muscle groups of the buttocks and thighs, and increases heart and breathing rate. Examples are walking, running, cycling, and swimming. Why is cardiovascular training possibly effective for cancer-related fatigue? Cancer-related fatigue is linked to the body's response to cytokines, which regulate how tissues and organs increase in size (called cell growth). Cancer or cancer therapy may produce proteins called pro-inflammatory cytokines, which cause or worsen inflammation (the body's response to an injury or illness). Cardiovascular training can help reduce inflammation. What did we want to find out? We wanted to know whether cardiovascular training reduces cancer-related fatigue compared to no training. We explored the effects at short (up to 12 weeks), medium (up to six months), and long term (longer than six months). We also looked at quality of life, unwanted effects, anxiety, and depression. What did we do? We searched for studies that investigated cardiovascular training before, during, or after anticancer therapy compared to no training. These studies needed to evaluate cancer-related fatigue or quality of life, or both. The cardiovascular training needed at least five exercise sessions and had to be provided face-to-face, either in person or by video. We excluded studies with fewer than 20 people per group or studies only available in short-summary form. What did we find? We found 23 studies with 2135 people, mostly women with breast cancer. Most studies were conducted in high-income countries. A total of 1101 people received cardiovascular training and 1034 received no training. We also found 36 ongoing studies and 12 completed but unpublished studies. Main results: There were no studies comparing cardiovascular training before anticancer therapy with no training. We included 10 studies of cardiovascular training during anticancer therapy but could use only eight in our analyses. For cardiovascular training after anticancer therapy versus no training, we found 13 studies but could use only nine. Cardiovascular training during anticancer therapy probably reduces short-term cancer-related fatigue slightly (6 studies, 593 people) and probably results in little to no difference in short-term quality of life (6 studies, 612 people). It is unclear whether cardiovascular training affects medium- or long-term fatigue, quality of life, or unwanted effects. For cardiovascular training after anticancer therapy, we do not know whether it increases or decreases short- or long-term fatigue, quality of life, or unwanted effects, and no data were available for medium-term effects. What are the limitations of the evidence? We are moderately confident in the evidence on short-term fatigue and quality of life during anticancer therapy. Our confidence in all other results is very low because the studies were fewer, smaller, or had design limitations such as lack of blinding. There was no evidence for cardiovascular training before anticancer therapy or for medium-term effects after therapy.",1015,cardiovascular training; cancer-related fatigue (CRF); quality of life (QoL); adverse events; anticancer therapy,How does the study differentiate the impact of cardiovascular training on cancer-related fatigue based on the timing of the training in relation to anticancer therapy?,What critical gaps in the research were identified regarding the effects of cardiovascular training on cancer-related fatigue and quality of life?,Select all of the following that are fruits,What is cancer-related fatigue?,"According to the summary, what effect does cardiovascular training during anticancer therapy have on short-term quality of life?","By comparing cardiovascular training outcomes before, during, and after anticancer therapy.; By evaluating different types of cardiovascular exercises separately.; By focusing only on the exercise intensity.","By comparing cardiovascular training outcomes before, during, and after anticancer therapy.",Lack of studies on training before anticancer therapy and unclear medium- and long-term effects.; Inadequate comparison between different cancer types.; Failure to include age as a significant variable.,Lack of studies on training before anticancer therapy and unclear medium- and long-term effects.,dog; blue; grape,grape,An extreme feeling of tiredness over a long period of time.; A short-lasting tiredness that can be relieved by rest.; A feeling of tiredness that only affects the mind.,An extreme feeling of tiredness over a long period of time.,It results in little to no difference.; It significantly improves quality of life.; It worsens quality of life.,It results in little to no difference.
62e02660c3ef175825ab7655,static_2,Do non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive medicines for steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome in children help prevent relapse?,"About 80% of children with steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SSNS) have relapses. Of these children, half will relapse frequently, and are at risk of adverse effects from corticosteroids. While non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive medications prolong periods of remission, they have significant potential adverse effects. Currently, there is no consensus about the most appropriate second-line agent in children with frequently relapsing SSNS. In addition, these medications could be used with corticosteroids in the initial episode of SSNS to prolong the period of remission. This is the fifth update of a review first published in 2001 and updated in 2005, 2008, 2013 and 2020. To evaluate the benefits and harms of non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive medications in SSNS in children with a relapsing course of SSNS and in children with their first episode of nephrotic syndrome.
We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to October 2024 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs were included if they involved children with SSNS and compared non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive medications with placebo, corticosteroids or no treatment; different non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive medications, or different doses, durations or routes of administration of the same non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive medication. Two authors independently assessed study eligibility, risk of bias and extracted data from the included studies. Statistical analyses were performed using a random-effects model and results expressed as risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes or mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. We identified 58 studies (122 reports) randomising 3720 children. Half were multicentre studies, and most studies were undertaken in South and East Asia (28 studies) and Europe (20 studies). The numbers of children randomised ranged from 14 to 211. Risk of bias assessment indicated that 32 and 33 studies were at low risk of bias for sequence generation and allocation concealment, respectively. Eleven studies were at low risk of performance bias and 13 were at low risk of detection bias. Forty-eight and 36 studies were at low risk of incomplete and selective reporting, respectively. Rituximab with or without prednisone compared with placebo with or without prednisone probably reduces the number of children experiencing relapse at six months (5 studies, 182 children: RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.43) and 12 months (3 studies, 108 children: RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.09) (moderate certainty), may increase the number with severe infusion reactions (4 studies, 162 children: RR 5.21, 95% CI 1.19 to 22.89; low certainty), but not severe infection or arthropathy (low certainty). Rituximab compared with tacrolimus probably reduces the risk of relapse at 12 months (4 studies, 238 children: RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.96)and may reduce the risk of relapse whencompared with low dose mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (1 study, 30 children: RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.62). Rituximab followed by MMF for 500 days reduces the risk of relapse compared with rituximab followed by placebo for 500 days (1 study, 78 children: RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.63; high certainty). Rituximab probably does not differ from ofatumumab in the riisk of relapse and 12 months (1 study, 140 children: RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.41; moderate certainty) or in adverse events. MMF and levamisole (1 study, 149 children: RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.16) may have similar effects on the number of children who relapse at 12 months (low certainty). Cyclosporin compared with MMF may reduce the risk of relapse at 12 months (3 studies, 114 children: RR 1.57, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.30) (low certainty). Levamisole compared with steroids or placebo may reduce the number of children with relapse during treatment (8 studies, 474 children: RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.82) (low certainty). Preliminary data from single studies indicate that levamisole and prednisone compared with prednisone alone may delay the onset of relapse after the initial episode of SSNS and that levamisole compared with increasing prednisone administration from alternate day to daily at the onset of infection may reduce the risk of relapse with infection (low certainty). Cyclosporin compared with prednisone may reduce the number of children who relapse (1 study, 104 children: RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.83) (low certainty). Alkylating agents compared with cyclosporin may make little or no difference to the risk of relapse during cyclosporin treatment (2 studies, 95 children: RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.48) (low certainty evidence) but may reduce the risk of relapse at 12 to 24 months (2 studies, 95 children: RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.74) (low certainty). Alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil) compared with prednisone probably reduce the number of children who experience relapse at six to 12 months (6 studies, 202 children: RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.60) and at 12 to 24 months (4 studies, 59 children: RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.46) (moderate certainty). New studies incorporated in this review update indicate that rituximab compared with prednisone, tacrolimus, or MMF is a valuable additional agent for managing children with relapsing SSNS. Comparative studies of CNIs, MMF, and levamisole suggest that CNIs may be more effective than MMF and that levamisole may be similar in efficacy to MMF. Important new studies suggest that MMF prolongs remission following rituximab, that levamisole may prevent infection-related relapse more effectively than changing from alternate-day to daily prednisone and that levamisole and prednisone compared with prednisone alone may prolong the time to first relapse. There are currently 23 ongoing studies which should improve our understanding of how to treat children with frequently relapsing SSNS.","Children with nephrotic syndrome lose large amounts of protein from their bloodstream into their urine, causing swelling, especially in the face, stomach and legs. The risk of infection also increases because important proteins used by children's immune systems are lost in the urine. Corticosteroid medication, such as prednisone, can stop protein loss, but this often happens again (relapse). Giving children further corticosteroids can lead to poor growth, cataracts, osteoporosis (a condition in which bones become weak and brittle) and high blood pressure. A wide range of medicines have been tried to treat relapses in children and to prevent further relapses in children who relapse frequently. Immunosuppressive medicines (medicines that dampen down the body's immune system) have different mechanisms of action and have been demonstrated to provide longer remission (a period of time when signs and symptoms of nephrotic syndrome disappear) compared with steroids alone. Using these may enable steroids to be withdrawn or the dose reduced. We wanted to find out the best treatment options for children who have frequent relapses of nephrotic syndrome to stop the leaking of protein from the blood into the urine and to avoid the harmful side effects of steroids. We also wanted to find out if these other treatment options were associated with any unwanted effects. We searched for all studies that compared the benefits and harms of randomly allocating non-steroid immunosuppressive medicines to children who have frequent repeated episodes of nephrotic syndrome. We compared and summarised the studies' results and rated our confidence in the information based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 58 studies randomising 3720 children looking at a wide variety of non-steroid treatment options. Half of the studies were conducted in multiple centres around the world, and most were done in South and East Asia (28 studies) and Europe (20 studies). The number of children randomised ranged from 14 to 211. Rituximab compared to a placebo (dummy medicine) probably reduces the risk of a relapse at six and 12 months, but may increase the number who have severe reactions to the infusion. Rituximab probably reduces the risk of relapse at 12 months when compared to tacrolimus, and may reduce the risk when compared to mycophenolate mofetil. We also found that mycophenolate mofetil prolongs the length of remission induced by rituximab. Tacrolimus, cyclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil, and levamisole may reduce the risk of relapse in children with frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome. Cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil compared with steroids probably reduce the number of children who experience a relapse. We are confident that mycophenolate mofetil prolongs the length of remission induced by rituximab. We are moderately confident that rituximab compared to placebo or tacrolimus reduces the risk of relapse in children who experience frequent relapses of nephrotic syndrome. We are also moderately confident that cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil compared with steroids probably reduce the number of children who experience a relapse. We are less confident about the effects of other non-steroid immunosuppressive medicines on reducing the risk of relapse. We are not confident in the evidence for adverse events, as they were rarely or poorly reported for all of our comparisons.",1088,Steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome; relapses; corticosteroids; immunosuppressive medications; rituximab; prednisone; tacrolimus; mycophenolate mofetil; cyclosporin; alkylating agents,What condition in children is associated with protein loss in the urine?,What are some possible side effects of corticosteroid use in children?,Select all of the following that are colors,How does rituximab compare to a placebo in preventing relapse?,Which medication is believed to prolong remission induced by rituximab?,Nephrotic syndrome; Osteoporosis; Cataracts,Nephrotic syndrome,High blood pressure; Improved growth; Cataracts,High blood pressure; Cataracts,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Probably reduces the risk of relapse; Has no effect on relapse risk; Increases risk of relapse,Probably reduces the risk of relapse,Mycophenolate mofetil; Levamisole; Cyclosporin,Mycophenolate mofetil
62e02660c3ef175825ab7655,interactive_3,Immunosuppressive treatment for focal segmental glomerulosclerosis in adults,"Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) can result from primary, genetic, or secondary causes; primary disease typically leads to nephrotic syndrome, while genetic and secondary forms may present with asymptomatic proteinuria or with nephrotic syndrome. Only about 20% of patients achieve partial or complete remission with treatment, and roughly half progress to kidney failure. This updated review assessed treatments for adults with FSGS and included 15 studies with 560 participants, all of whom had steroid-resistant disease since no trials evaluated corticosteroids versus placebo despite guidelines recommending steroids as first-line therapy. Five studies compared cyclosporin, with or without prednisone, to various treatments including no specific therapy, prednisone, methylprednisolone, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and dexamethasone. Other small single trials evaluated monoclonal antibodies such as adalimumab and fresolimumab, rituximab versus tacrolimus, cyclosporin plus valsartan versus cyclosporin alone, MMF versus prednisone, chlorambucil with steroids versus no treatment, different dexamethasone regimens, CCX140-B versus placebo, and one larger study compared sparsentan to irbesartan. Evidence for cyclosporin suggested it may increase the likelihood of complete remission and of combined complete or partial remission, though results were imprecise and based on few small trials. Cyclosporin showed little to no difference in preventing chronic kidney disease progression or kidney failure, and its effects on hypertension or infection remained uncertain. MMF appeared to offer little or no difference compared to prednisone for remission outcomes or kidney function, and most other interventions had very low certainty evidence, preventing firm conclusions. It is also uncertain whether sparsentan reduces proteinuria more effectively than irbesartan. Overall, no trials evaluated the recommended first-line therapy of corticosteroids, and the available evidence applies only to steroid-resistant FSGS. Cyclosporin may improve remission rates when given for at least six months, but confidence in these findings is limited by the small size and variability of the studies. Future trials must more clearly define patient populations distinguishing primary, genetic, and secondary FSGS to support stronger treatment recommendations.","Nephrotic syndrome is a condition where the kidneys leak protein from the blood into the urine. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) defined on kidney biopsy is an uncommon cause of nephrotic syndrome disease but it progresses to kidney failure in about half of all cases. It can be divided into three groups - primary FSGS (thought to be due to a factor circulating in the blood that damages the kidneys), genetic (secondary to mutations in one or more genes), and secondary to other causes, including certain infections. Treatments aim to reduce the amount of protein in the urine completely or partly to increase the time before kidney failure develops.
We looked at all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which examined therapy with prednisone or other agents which affect the immune system such as cyclosporin and mycophenolate mofetil and other agents with or without steroid therapy. We found 15 studies involving 553 participants. In five studies cyclosporin was compared with different treatments. Combining four studies (231 participants) showed that cyclosporin was more effective than these other treatments in achieving complete remission of nephrotic syndrome. The studies were too small and lasted for too short a time to determine if cyclosporin reduced the risk of kidney failure.

62e02660c3ef175825ab7655,interactive_4,Aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for the prevention of dementia,"Dementia is a worldwide concern. Its global prevalence is increasing. At present, there is no medication licensed to prevent or delay the onset of dementia. Inflammation has been suggested as a key factor in dementia pathogenesis. Therefore, medications with anti-inflammatory properties could be beneficial for dementia prevention. To evaluate the effectiveness and adverse effects of aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for the primary or secondary prevention of dementia. We searched ALOIS, the specialised register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group up to 9 January 2020. ALOIS contains records of clinical trials identified from monthly searches of several major healthcare databases, trial registries and grey literature sources. We ran additional searches across MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP) and six other databases to ensure that the searches were as comprehensive and up-to-date as possible. We also reviewed citations of reference lists of included studies. We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) comparing aspirin or other NSAIDs with placebo for the primary or secondary prevention of dementia. We included trials with cognitively healthy participants (primary prevention) or participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or cognitive complaints (secondary prevention). We used standard methodological procedures according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We rated the strength of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach. We included four RCTs with 23,187 participants. Because of the diversity of these trials, we did not combine data to give summary estimates, but presented a narrative description of the evidence. We identified one trial (19,114 participants) comparing low-dose aspirin (100 mg once daily) to placebo. Participants were aged 70 years or older with no history of dementia, cardiovascular disease or physical disability. Interim analysis indicated no significant treatment effect and the trial was terminated slightly early after a median of 4.7 years' follow-up. There was no evidence of a difference in incidence of dementia between aspirin and placebo groups (risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.15; high-certainty evidence). Participants allocated aspirin had higher rates of major bleeding (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.60, high-certainty evidence) and slightly higher mortality (RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.28; high-certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in activities of daily living between groups (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.02; high-certainty evidence). We identified three trials comparing non-aspirin NSAIDs to placebo. All three trials were terminated early due to adverse events associated with NSAIDs reported in other trials. One trial (2528 participants) investigated the cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor celecoxib (200 mg twice daily) and the non-selective NSAID naproxen (220 mg twice daily) for preventing dementia in cognitively healthy older adults with a family history of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Median follow-up was 734 days. Combining both NSAID treatment arms, there was no evidence of a difference in the incidence of AD between participants allocated NSAIDs and those allocated placebo (RR 1.91, 95% CI 0.89 to 4.10; moderate-certainty evidence). There was also no evidence of a difference in rates of myocardial infarction (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.61 to 2.40), stroke (RR 1.82, 95% CI 0.76 to 4.37) or mortality (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.43) between treatment groups (all moderate-certainty evidence). One trial (88 participants) assessed the effectiveness of celecoxib (200 mg or 400 mg daily) in delaying cognitive decline in participants aged 40 to 81 years with mild age-related memory loss but normal memory performance scores. Mean duration of follow-up was 17.6 months in the celecoxib group and 18.1 months in the placebo group. There was no evidence of a difference between groups in test scores in any of six cognitive domains. Participants allocated celecoxib experienced more gastrointestinal adverse events than those allocated placebo (RR 2.66, 95% CI 1.05 to 6.75; low-certainty evidence). One trial (1457 participants) assessed the effectiveness of the COX-2 inhibitor rofecoxib (25 mg once daily) in delaying or preventing a diagnosis of AD in participants with MCI. Median duration of study participation was 115 weeks in the rofecoxib group and 130 weeks in the placebo group. There was a higher incidence of AD in the rofecoxib than the placebo group (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.72; moderate-certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between groups in cardiovascular adverse events (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.66; moderate-certainty evidence) or mortality (RR 1.62, 95% CI 0.85 to 3.05; moderate-certainty evidence). Participants allocated rofecoxib had more upper gastrointestinal adverse events (RR 3.53, 95% CI 1.17 to 10.68; moderate-certainty evidence). Reported annual mean difference scores showed no evidence of a difference between groups in activities of daily living (year 1: no data available; year 2: 0.0, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.2; year 3: 0.1, 95% CI - 0.1 to 0.3; year 4: 0.1, 95% CI -0.1 to 0.4; moderate-certainty evidence). There is no evidence to support the use of low-dose aspirin or other NSAIDs of any class (celecoxib, rofecoxib or naproxen) for the prevention of dementia, but there was evidence of harm. Although there were limitations in the available evidence, it seems unlikely that there is any need for further trials of low-dose aspirin for dementia prevention. If future studies of NSAIDs for dementia prevention are planned, they will need to be cognisant of the safety concerns arising from the existing studies.","Dementia is a worldwide healthcare concern. At present, there is no medicine that is proven to delay or prevent the onset of dementia. The biology of dementia is still poorly understood. However, there are reasons to believe that inflammation may be partly responsible for some of the brain changes seen in dementia. There are many medicines that have anti-inflammatory properties, including aspirin and NSAIDs that are often sold as pain killers. We wanted to see if these medicines had any effect on developing dementia. These medicines have a few potential side effects, including heart attack and bleeding, so we also assessed for any harmful effects of the medicines. We searched for relevant studies that had been published up to January 2020. We found four trials that met the inclusion criteria for this review (23,187 people). One trial was undertaken in the USA and Australia and three in the USA only. The trials included different populations. One was of aspirin in healthy people with no history of dementia, cardiovascular disease or physical disability. The other three were of NSAIDs other than aspirin and were conducted in healthy people with a family history of Alzheimer's disease, people with self-reported memory loss and people with mild cognitive impairment (a slight but noticeable and measurable decline in cognitive abilities, including memory and thinking skills). All of the included studies had limitations. The study of aspirin was stopped early due to ineffectiveness. The three studies of other NSAIDs (celecoxib, naproxen and rofecoxib) were stopped early due to concerns around the safety. This review found no evidence to support the use of either aspirin or other NSAIDs for the prevention of dementia and, in fact, there was some suggestion that they may cause harm. The studies had limitations, but, given the concerns over safety, further studies of low-dose aspirin for dementia prevention seem unlikely. If future studies of NSAIDs for dementia prevention are planned, then these will need to be mindful of the safety concerns arising from the studies included in this review and from other studies of the same medicines.",1132,Dementia; inflammation; anti-inflammatory properties; non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); primary prevention; secondary prevention; cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor; celecoxib; naproxen; rofecoxib,What could be the implications of the study's findings on future research into dementia prevention utilizing NSAIDs?,In what ways do the limitations of these studies influence the perceived strength of the evidence regarding NSAIDs' effectiveness in dementia prevention?,Select all of the following that are colors,Identify the primary goal of the study regarding these medications.,Summarize the main finding of the aspirin study in relation to dementia prevention.,Future studies will likely focus on alternative anti-inflammatory agents.; The safety concerns highlighted will necessitate the development of safer NSAID formulations.; There will be an increased interest in combining NSAIDs with other treatments to enhance effectiveness.,Future studies will likely focus on alternative anti-inflammatory agents.; The safety concerns highlighted will necessitate the development of safer NSAID formulations.,The limitations significantly weaken the evidence's reliability.; The limitations bolster confidence in the studies' findings.; The limitations necessitate a nuanced interpretation of the results.,The limitations significantly weaken the evidence's reliability.; The limitations necessitate a nuanced interpretation of the results.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,To observe their effectiveness in delaying or preventing dementia; To cure existing cases of dementia; To discover new side effects,To observe their effectiveness in delaying or preventing dementia,No evidence was found to support the use of aspirin for dementia prevention.; Aspirin was found to effectively prevent dementia.; Aspirin increased the risk of developing dementia.,No evidence was found to support the use of aspirin for dementia prevention.
62e02660c3ef175825ab7655,interactive_4,Lipid-lowering agents for nephrotic syndrome,"Nephrotic syndrome is the collective name given to a group of symptoms that include proteinuria, lipiduria, hypoalbuminaemia, oedema, hypercholesterolaemia, elevated triglycerides, and hyperlipidaemia. Hyperlipidaemia is thought to aggravate glomerulosclerosis (hardening of blood vessels in the kidneys) and enhance progression of glomerular disease. Studies have established that reduction in total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is associated with reduction in risk of cardiovascular diseases. In 2011, the European Society of Cardiology and European Atherosclerosis Society guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemia recommended use of statins as first-line agents in the management of nephrotic dyslipidaemia. However, the effectiveness and safety of statins for people with nephrotic syndrome remains uncertain. Furthermore, the efficacy of second-line lipid-lowering drugs, such as ezetimibe and nicotinic acid, has not been proven in patients with nephrotic syndrome who are unable to tolerate statin therapy. This review aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of lipid-lowering agents in adults and children with nephrotic syndrome. We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register (to 18 March 2013) through contact with the Trials Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review. All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs (RCTs in which allocation to treatment was obtained by alternation, use of alternate medical records, date of birth or other predictable methods) looking at participants with nephrotic syndrome that compared any lipid-lowering agent to placebo, no treatment or other lipid-lowering agents, given for not less than four weeks, were included. Two authors independently assessed study eligibility and risk of bias, and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using a random effects model. Dichotomous results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). For continuous measures mean difference (MD) was used, or the standardised mean difference (SMD) where different scales had been used. We included five RCTs enrolling a total of 203 participants. Of these, four studies compared statins with no treatment or placebo, and one compared fibrates with placebo. We found no published studies comparing second-line agents such as ezetimibe, bile acid sequestrants, and nicotinic acid with placebo or no treatment. Our assessment of the risk of bias found that one study was judged overall to be at low risk of bias and the remaining four were judged to be at high risk of bias. Most outcomes were supported by single study data. One study reported significantly increased high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol among participants in the statin arm compared with the no treatment group (MD 5.40 mg/dL, 95% CI 2.31 to 8.49). Another study reported higher serum albumin in the statin group compared to those who received no treatment (MD 0.60 g/dL, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.06). No serious adverse events, such as rhabdomyolysis, were reported, however some minor events occurred. One study reported no significant difference in the number of participants with elevated liver enzymes (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.13 to 69.52); three studies reported liver enzymes remained within the normal range (no data provided). Four studies reported creatinine phosphokinase (CPK). One study indicated that CPK values fluctuated in both the simvastatin and placebo groups (no data provided); the remaining three studies reported CPK either stayed within the normal range (one study) or there was no significant difference between the lipid lowering agents and placebo. None of the included studies reported patient-centred outcomes including all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, or non-fatal myocardial infarction; only single studies reported cholesterol (HDL, LDL and total cholesterol), triglycerides, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, liver enzymes, and protein (serum, urine). High quality RCTs need to be conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of lipid-lowering drugs for people with nephrotic syndrome.","Nephrotic syndrome is a relatively rare condition in which the kidneys leak protein into the urine, leading to early signs such as swelling of the feet and face, along with low levels of protein in the blood and high levels of fats, particularly cholesterol and triglycerides. Management often includes therapies to reduce blood lipids, and several types of lipid-lowering drugs such as statins, bile acid sequestrants, nicotinic acid, and ezetimibe can be used. We searched for evidence from randomized controlled trials to determine whether lipid-lowering medications are beneficial for people with nephrotic syndrome. We found five small studies involving 203 participants that examined four different lipid-lowering agents: simvastatin, lovastatin, fluvastatin, and gemfibrozil. Based on the available evidence, there is currently not enough high-quality research to determine whether lipid-lowering drugs are effective for managing dyslipidaemia in people with nephrotic syndrome.",1084,nephrotic syndrome; oedema; hypercholesterolaemia; hyperlipidaemia; glomerulosclerosis; dyslipidaemia; statins; nicotinic acid; rhabdomyolysis; creatinine phosphokinase (CPK),What condition involves kidneys leaking protein into urine?,Identify a type of medication used to manage blood lipids in nephrotic syndrome.,Select all of the following that are colors,Summarize the main reason for using lipid-lowering drugs in nephrotic syndrome treatment.,Describe the evidence available for the effectiveness of lipid-lowering drugs in nephrotic syndrome.,Nephrotic syndrome; Hypertension; Diabetes,Nephrotic syndrome,Statins; Antibiotics; Painkillers,Statins,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,To reduce blood fat levels; To increase urination; To boost immune response,To reduce blood fat levels,Insufficient high-quality research; Clear and well-documented effectiveness; No research conducted,Insufficient high-quality research
62e02660c3ef175825ab7655,finetuned_5,Statins for the prevention of dementia,"This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2001 and then updated in 2009. Vascular risk factors including high cholesterol levels increase the risk of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease and of vascular dementia. Some observational studies have suggested an association between statin use and lowered incidence of dementia.
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of statins for the prevention of dementia in people at risk of dementia due to their age and to determine whether the efficacy and safety of statins for this purpose depends on cholesterol level, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype or cognitive level.
We searched ALOIS (the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group), The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) Portal on 11 November 2015. We included double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials in which statins were administered for at least 12 months to people at risk of dementia. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We included two trials with 26,340 participants aged 40 to 82 years of whom 11,610 were aged 70 or older. All participants had a history of, or risk factors for, vascular disease. The studies used different statins (simvastatin and pravastatin). Mean follow-up was 3.2 years in one study and five years in one study. The risk of bias was low. Only one study reported on the incidence of dementia (20,536 participants, 31 cases in each group; odds ratio (OR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61 to 1.65, moderate quality evidence, downgraded due to imprecision). Both studies assessed cognitive function, but at different times using different scales, so we judged the results unsuitable for a meta-analysis. There were no differences between statin and placebo groups on five different cognitive tests (high quality evidence). Rates of treatment discontinuation due to non-fatal adverse events were less than 5% in both studies and there was no difference between statin and placebo groups in the risk of withdrawal due to adverse events (26,340 participants, 2 studies, OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.05). There is good evidence that statins given in late life to people at risk of vascular disease do not prevent cognitive decline or dementia. Biologically, it seems feasible that statins could prevent dementia due to their role in cholesterol reduction and initial evidence from observational studies was very promising. However, indication bias may have been a factor in these studies and the evidence from subsequent RCTs has been negative. There were limitations in the included studies involving the cognitive assessments used and the inclusion of participants at moderate to high vascular risk only.","Dementia (including Alzheimer's disease) is a global healthcare concern; the number of people affected worldwide is predicted to double every 20 years, reaching 74.7 million in 2010 and 131.5 million in 2050. Therefore, it is important to find means of preventing dementia. It has been suggested that high levels of cholesterol in the serum (part of the blood) may increase the risk of dementia and that treatment with cholesterol-lowering medicines such as statins may reduce the risk of dementia. We searched medical databases for clinical trials comparing giving a statin to giving a placebo (pretend medicine) to people with normal cognitive function (which is brain activities that allow us to gain and use knowledge) and of sufficient age to be at risk of Alzheimer's disease. There were limitations in the included studies involving the methods of assessment of cognition and the inclusion only of participants deemed to be of moderate to high risk of a problem with their blood (vascular) system. Nevertheless, there was good evidence that statins given in late life to people at risk of vascular disease do not prevent cognitive decline or dementia.",1131,dementia; statins; Alzheimer's disease; vascular dementia; apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype; cognitive decline; vascular risk factors; cholesterol reduction; adverse events; incidence of dementia,What key limitations in the studies may have impacted the conclusions about statins and dementia prevention?,Why might the biological mechanism of statins suggest potential for dementia prevention?,Select all of the following that are colors,Summarize the conclusion about the effect of statins on cognitive decline.,Explain the proposed relationship between cholesterol levels and dementia risk.,The methods of cognition assessment used; The exclusion of participants with low vascular risk; The lack of placebo control,The methods of cognition assessment used; The exclusion of participants with low vascular risk,Statins are known for their cholesterol-reducing role; Statins enhance cognitive function directly; Statins alter brain structure to prevent decline,Statins are known for their cholesterol-reducing role,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Statins do not prevent cognitive decline; Statins significantly increase cognitive function; Statins have an unpredictable effect on cognition,Statins do not prevent cognitive decline,High cholesterol may increase dementia risk; Low cholesterol directly causes dementia; Cholesterol has no link to dementia risk,High cholesterol may increase dementia risk
62e02660c3ef175825ab7655,finetuned_6,Immunosuppressive treatment for adults with idiopathic membranous nephropathy,"Primary membranous nephropathy (PMN) is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults, and without treatment about one-third of patients experience spontaneous remission, one-third have persistent proteinuria, and one-third progress to end?stage kidney disease (ESKD) within 10 years. Immunosuppressive therapy is used to protect kidney function in patients who do not improve with supportive treatment or who present with severe nephrotic syndrome, but the relative safety and effectiveness of different treatments have been unclear. This updated review included 65 studies involving 3807 adults with PMN and found that, compared with placebo or no immunosuppression, immunosuppressive therapy probably reduces the risk of progressing to ESKD, increases the likelihood of complete or partial remission, and lowers the number of people whose serum creatinine doubles, though it probably makes little or no difference to mortality. However, immunosuppressive therapy may increase relapse after remission and may increase temporary or permanent treatment discontinuation due to adverse effects, while its effects on infection and malignancy remain uncertain. Oral alkylating agents with or without steroids may reduce the risk of ESKD and may increase remission rates but also may lead to more treatment?related adverse events, and their effects on relapse, creatinine progression, infection, and malignancy remain uncertain. Evidence for calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus or cyclosporine), with or without steroids, was very uncertain, including whether they affect remission, relapse, ESKD, or adverse events. When calcineurin inhibitors were compared to alkylating agents, they appeared similarly effective for achieving remission but may result in higher relapse rates, though the overall certainty of evidence was low to moderate. Other treatments such as azathioprine, mizoribine, adrenocorticotropic hormone, traditional Chinese medicines, and rituximab had insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions. Overall, immunosuppressive therapy appears more effective than non-immunosuppressive management for inducing remission and reducing progression to ESKD, but this must be weighed against higher risks of adverse effects, and the evidence base remains limited by small sample sizes, high risk of bias, and inadequate follow-up. Alkylating agents combined with corticosteroids show both short- and long-term benefits but also higher toxicity, calcineurin inhibitors show similar efficacy but uncertain long-term safety, and biologics such as rituximab require further large, high-quality trials to determine their role.","Primary membranous nephropathy (PMN) is an autoimmune disease, where the body's immune system attacks the kidneys. The term ""primary"" is used to describe membranous nephropathy that is not caused by another disease in the body. PMN is a leading cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults. Nephrotic syndrome is a condition, where the membrane of the kidney is damaged and becomes permeable for proteins. Primary membranous nephropathy is diagnosed through findings in a kidney biopsy and the presence of nephrotic syndrome. PMN is not harmful in about one-third of patients, who will have a spontaneous ""complete remission"", which means that the disease will resolve by itself. However, about another one third will experience spontaneous remission but will have some protein in the urine that continues with normal kidney function. These patients usually only require supportive treatments that do not interact with the immune system. Without treatment, about 15% to 50% of patients progress to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) within 10 years. In some patients, PMN can be severe or continues to get worse even after using 6 months of supportive treatments. In these patients, extra treatment that dampens the activity of the immune system may be used to reduce damage to the kidney. It is not clear which of these treatment(s) is the most helpful and what side effects can occur. Therefore, the duration and intensity of immunosuppressive treatment need to be balanced against possible side effects. There are different classes of drugs used in immunosuppressive therapy. These drugs may or may not be combined with corticosteroids (drugs based on the body's stress response hormone cortisol). We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant specialised register up to 1 April 2021. We have combined studies to compare different treatment regimens with immunosuppressive therapy to assess which treatments help to treat patients with PMN and nephrotic syndrome with the least side effects. This review identified sixty-five studies with 3807 patients. Different types of immunosuppressive treatment include alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil), calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus and cyclosporine), antimetabolites (mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine), biologicals (e.g. rituximab) and adrenocorticotropic hormone. These drugs may or may not be combined with corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone), which also suppresses the immune system. After combining the results of available studies together, we found that compared with no treatment, supportive treatment or steroids alone, the use of immunosuppressive treatment probably reduced the number of patients who progressed to ESKD by about 40% and increased the number of patients that achieved complete remission. However, immunosuppressive treatment may lead to more adverse events, which can cause treatment to be stopped or lead to the patients needing to go to hospital. The different drugs that can be used in the immunosuppressive treatment were also examined in our review. We found that alkylating agents probably increases complete remission but may lead to more adverse events. We are uncertain whether alkylating agents increase infection or cancer. Based on the currently available evidence, the effectiveness of using calcineurin inhibitors is still unclear, but there is low certainty of the evidence, that CNI may lead to similar remission rates compared to alkylating agents.
Furthermore, other treatment options such as mycophenolate mofetil, adrenocorticotropic hormone, rituximab and others have only been examined in a few studies. There is not enough data to draw final conclusions on the use of these treatments in adults with PMN and nephrotic syndrome. The treatment of patients with PMN and nephrotic syndrome with immunosuppressive therapy compared to no treatment or supportive therapy alone probably protects the kidney but may increase side effects. A combination of immunosuppressive therapy with steroids may decrease disease activity and the use of alkylating agent combined with steroids probably has the short-term and long-term benefits of limiting damage to the kidney. Other therapies such as calcineurin inhibitors, mycophenolate mofetil, rituximab and adrenocorticotropic hormone have less certainty regarding their safety and effectiveness from these studies.",1086,Primary membranous nephropathy; nephrotic syndrome; immunosuppressive therapy; end-stage kidney disease; proteinuria; spontaneous remission; serum creatinine; alkylating agents; calcineurin inhibitors; rituximab,What is primary membranous nephropathy (PMN) primarily characterized by?,"In the context of PMN, what does spontaneous remission imply?",Select all of the following that are fruits,Which type of PMN patients might require immunosuppressive therapy?,What is a primary goal of immunosuppressive therapy in PMN treatment?,An autoimmune attack on the kidneys; A viral infection affecting the kidneys; A genetic disorder affecting the kidneys,An autoimmune attack on the kidneys,The disease resolves by itself; Immediate need for immunosuppressive therapy; Progression to end-stage kidney disease,The disease resolves by itself,dog; blue; grape,grape,Patients with spontaneous complete remission; Patients with severe or worsening PMN; All patients with nephrotic syndrome,Patients with severe or worsening PMN,To reduce the progression to end-stage kidney disease; To increase proteinuria; To eliminate the need for biopsy,To reduce the progression to end-stage kidney disease
62e02660c3ef175825ab7655,finetuned_6,Bisphosphonates and denosumab for breast cancer,"Bone is the most common site of metastatic disease associated with breast cancer (BC). Bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, and novel targeted therapies such as denosumab inhibit other key bone metabolism pathways. We have studied these agents in both early breast cancer and advanced breast cancer settings. This is an update of the review originally published in 2002 and subsequently updated in 2005 and 2012.
To assess the effects of bisphosphonates and other bone agents in addition to anti-cancer treatment: (i) in women with early breast cancer (EBC); (ii) in women with advanced breast cancer without bone metastases (ABC); and (iii) in women with metastatic breast cancer and bone metastases (BCBM).
In this review update, we searched Cochrane Breast Cancer's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov on 19 September 2016.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing: (a) one treatment with a bisphosphonate/bone-acting agent with the same treatment without a bisphosphonate/bone-acting agent; (b) treatment with one bisphosphonate versus treatment with a different bisphosphonate; (c) treatment with a bisphosphonate versus another bone-acting agent of a different mechanism of action (e.g. denosumab); and (d) immediate treatment with a bisphosphonate/bone-acting agent versus delayed treatment of the same bisphosphonate/bone-acting agent.
Two review authors independently extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and quality of the evidence. The primary outcome measure was bone metastases for EBC and ABC, and a skeletal-related event (SRE) for BCBM. We derived risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and the meta-analyses used random-effects models. Secondary outcomes included overall survival and disease-free survival for EBC; we derived hazard ratios (HRs) for these time-to-event outcomes where possible. We collected toxicity and quality-of-life information. GRADE was used to assess the quality of evidence for the most important outcomes in each treatment setting.
We included 44 RCTs involving 37,302 women. In women with EBC, bisphosphonates were associated with a reduced risk of bone metastases compared to placebo/no bisphosphonate (RR 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75 to 0.99; P = 0.03, 11 studies; 15,005 women; moderate-quality evidence with no significant heterogeneity). Bisphosphonates provided an overall survival benefit with time-to-event data (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.99; P = 0.04; 9 studies; 13,949 women; high-quality evidence with evidence of heterogeneity). Subgroup analysis by menopausal status showed a survival benefit from bisphosphonates in postmenopausal women (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.90; P = 0.001; 4 studies; 6048 women; high-quality evidence with no evidence of heterogeneity) but no survival benefit for premenopausal women (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.22; P = 0.78; 2 studies; 3501 women; high-quality evidence with no heterogeneity). There was evidence of no effect of bisphosphonates on disease-free survival (HR 0.94, 95% 0.87 to 1.02; P = 0.13; 7 studies; 12,578 women; high-quality evidence with significant heterogeneity present) however subgroup analyses showed a disease-free survival benefit from bisphosphonates in postmenopausal women only (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.91; P < 0.001; 7 studies; 8314 women; high-quality evidence with no heterogeneity). Bisphosphonates did not significantly reduce the incidence of fractures when compared to placebo/no bisphosphonates (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.08, P = 0.13, 6 studies, 7602 women; moderate-quality evidence due to wide confidence intervals). We await mature overall survival and disease-free survival results for denosumab trials. In women with ABC without clinically evident bone metastases, there was no evidence of an effect of bisphosphonates on bone metastases (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.43; P = 0.86; 3 studies; 330 women; moderate-quality evidence with no heterogeneity) or overall survival (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.09; P = 0.28; 3 studies; 330 women; high-quality evidence with no heterogeneity) compared to placebo/no bisphosphonates however the confidence intervals were wide. One study reported a trend towards an extended period of time without a SRE with bisphosphonate compared to placebo (low-quality evidence). One study reported quality of life and there was no apparent difference in scores between bisphosphonate and placebo (moderate-quality evidence). In women with BCBM, bisphosphonates reduced the SRE risk by 14% (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.95; P = 0.003; 9 studies; 2810 women; high-quality evidence with evidence of heterogeneity) compared with placebo/no bisphosphonates. This benefit persisted when administering either intravenous or oral bisphosphonates versus placebo. Bisphosphonates delayed the median time to a SRE with a median ratio of 1.43 (95% CI 1.29 to 1.58; P < 0.00001; 9 studies; 2891 women; high-quality evidence with no heterogeneity) and reduced bone pain (in 6 out of 11 studies; moderate-quality evidence) compared to placebo/no bisphosphonate. Treatment with bisphosphonates did not appear to affect overall survival (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.11; P = 0.85; 7 studies; 1935 women; moderate-quality evidence with significant heterogeneity). Quality-of-life scores were slightly better with bisphosphonates than placebo at comparable time points (in three out of five studies; moderate-quality evidence) however scores decreased during the course of the studies. Denosumab reduced the risk of developing a SRE compared with bisphosphonates by 22% (RR 0.78, 0.72 to 0.85; P < 0.001; 3 studies, 2345 women). One study reported data on overall survival and observed no difference in survival between denosumab and bisphosphonate. Reported toxicities across all settings were generally mild. Osteonecrosis of the jaw was rare, occurring less than 0.5% in the adjuvant setting (high-quality evidence).
For women with EBC, bisphosphonates reduce the risk of bone metastases and provide an overall survival benefit compared to placebo or no bisphosphonates. There is preliminary evidence suggestive that bisphosphonates provide an overall survival and disease-free survival benefit in postmenopausal women only when compared to placebo or no bisphosphonate. This was not a planned subgroup for these early trials, and we await the completion of new large clinical trials assessing benefit for postmenopausal women. For women with BCBM, bisphosphonates reduce the risk of developing SREs, delay the median time to an SRE, and appear to reduce bone pain compared to placebo or no bisphosphonate.","Breast cancer may spread and recur in the bones. This may cause fractures, pain and high calcium in the bloodstream (known as complications).
Medicines for osteoporosis may prevent these complications and may help cure cancer by reducing cancer growth in the bone. These medicines are called 'bisphosphonates'. A newer type is called  denosumab. Bisphosphonates or denosumab are given in addition to other cancer treatment medications. These may be given along with chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, or radiotherapy.
The goal of bisphosphonates and denosumab differs based on the women's breast cancer status.
We asked three main questions:
1. For women with early breast cancer (EBC) , can bisphosphonates or denosumab reduce the risk of the cancer spreading to the bone? Will adding this medicine to anticancer treatments allow women to live longer (improve survival)?
2. For women with advanced breast cancer which does not appear to involve the bone (ABC) , can bisphosphonates reduce the risk of the cancer spreading to the bone and improve survival? Will bisphosphonates reduce complications and improve quality of life?
3. For women with metastatic breast cancer that has spread to the bone (BCBM), can bisphosphonates or denosumab reduce the risk of complication, and improve quality of life and survival?
We found 44 studies involving 37,302 participants. We included studies published by September 2016.
For women with EBC, we included 17 studies with 26,129 participants. The women's health was monitored for at least 12 months from the start of the study. Some studies monitored women for 10 years.
The studies tested different types of bisphosphonate drugs and denosumab, and different doses of these drugs. Some studies compared the drugs to no treatment. Some studies used oral medications. Other studies gave the medicine as an injection into a vein or under the skin.
Bisphosphonates probably lowered the risk of cancer spreading to the bone.
Bisphosphonates were found to improve survival, but the benefit in the whole group of women was small. Postmenopausal women had a benefit from bisphosphonates with improved survival and reduced risk of cancer returning. Premenopausal women did not have improved survival or reduced risk of the cancer returning. New studies that test bisphosphonates by the women's menopausal status are awaited.
We await the reporting of data on survival and other important outcomes from denosumab trials.
For women with ABC that had not spread to the bone, we included three studies enrolling 330 participants. All three studies compared oral bisphosphonates to no treatment.
Bisphosphonates did not reduce the risk of cancer spreading to the bone or improve survival. Very little information was available on complications and quality of life from only one study.
For women with BCBM, we included 24 studies enrolling 10,853 participants. Their health was monitored for at least 12 months. Some women were followed for 24 months. Most studies compared bisphosphonates to receiving no medication.
Bisphosphonates reduced complications (fractures and bone pain). Bisphosphonates did not appear to increase the length of time women survived. Quality of life scores were slightly better for women receiving bisphosphonates compared to similar women having no bisphosphonates.
Denosumab reduced the risk of complications compared to bisphosphonates in the three studies that collected these data. There was no benefit in survival from denosumab in the one study that collected data.
Side effects were uncommon and mild. There was a rare risk of damage to the jaw bone (osteonecrosis of the jaw).
Overall, most of the evidence was moderate to high-quality.

5cce9b46b09ec90015f3ef05,static_1,Melatonin and agomelatine for prevention of winter depression,"Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a seasonal pattern of recurrent major depressive episodes that most commonly starts in autumn or winter and remits in spring. The prevalence of SAD depends on latitude and ranges from 1.5% to 9%. The predictable seasonal aspect of SAD provides a promising opportunity for prevention in people who have a history of SAD. This is one of four reviews on the efficacy and safety of interventions to prevent SAD; we focus on agomelatine and melatonin as preventive interventions. To assess the efficacy and safety of agomelatine and melatonin (in comparison with each other, placebo, second-generation antidepressants, light therapy, psychological therapy or lifestyle interventions) in preventing SAD and improving person-centred outcomes among adults with a history of SAD. We searched Ovid MEDLINE (1950- ), Embase (1974- ), PsycINFO (1967- ) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to 19 June 2018. An earlier search of these databases was conducted via the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trial Register (CCMD-CTR) (all years to 11 August 2015). Furthermore, we searched the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database and international trial registers (to 19 June 2018). We also conducted a grey literature search and handsearched the reference lists of included studies and pertinent review articles. To examine efficacy, we included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on adults with a history of winter-type SAD who were free of symptoms at the beginning of the study. For adverse events, we intended also to include non-randomised studies. We planned to include studies that compared agomelatine versus melatonin, or agomelatine or melatonin versus placebo, any second-generation antidepressant, light therapy, psychological therapies or lifestyle changes. We also intended to compare melatonin or agomelatine in combination with any of the comparator interventions mentioned above versus the same comparator intervention as monotherapy.
Two review authors screened abstracts and full-text publications, abstracted data and assessed risk of bias of included studies independently. We intended to pool data in a meta-analysis using a random-effects model, but included only one study. We identified 3745 citations through electronic searches and reviews of reference lists after deduplication of search results. We excluded 3619 records during title and abstract review and assessed 126 full-text papers for inclusion in the review. Only one study, providing data of 225 participants, met our eligibility criteria and compared agomelatine (25 mg/day) with placebo. We rated it as having high risk of attrition bias because nearly half of the participants left the study before completion. We rated the certainty of the evidence as very low for all outcomes, because of high risk of bias, indirectness, and imprecision. The main analysis based on data of 199 participants rendered an indeterminate result with wide confidence intervals (CIs) that may encompass both a relevant reduction as well as a relevant increase of SAD incidence by agomelatine (risk ratio (RR) 0.83, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.34; 199 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Also the severity of SAD may be similar in both groups at the end of the study with a mean SIGH-SAD (Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Seasonal Affective Disorders) score of 8.3 (standard deviation (SD) 9.4) in the agomelatine group and 10.1 (SD 10.6) in the placebo group (mean difference (MD) -1.80, 95% CI -4.58 to 0.98; 199 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events may be similar in both groups. In the agomelatine group, 64 out of 112 participants experienced at least one adverse event, while 61 out of 113 did in the placebo group (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.34; 225 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Three out of 112 patients experienced serious adverse events in the agomelatine group, compared to 4 out of 113 in the placebo group (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.17 to 3.30; 225 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No data on quality of life or interpersonal functioning were reported. We did not identify any studies on melatonin.
Given the uncertain evidence on agomelatine and the absence of studies on melatonin, no conclusion about efficacy and safety of agomelatine and melatonin for prevention of SAD can currently be drawn. The decision for or against initiating preventive treatment of SAD and the treatment selected should consider patient preferences and reflect on the evidence base of all available treatment options.","Many people in northern latitudes suffer from seasonal affective disorder (SAD), which occurs as a reaction to reduced sunlight. Three-quarters of those affected are women. Lethargy, overeating, craving for carbohydrates and depressed mood are common symptoms. In some people, SAD becomes depression that seriously affects their daily lives. Up to two-thirds experience depressive symptoms every winter. General practitioners, psychiatrists, pharmacists, other health professionals working in adult mental health services, and researchers could be interested in the results of this review. Anyone who has experienced winter depression, or who has friends or relatives who have experienced winter depression might also be interested. Because of the seasonal pattern and high recurrence of SAD, melatonin or agomelatine could be used to prevent the onset of depressed mood. The goal of this report is to examine whether benefits outweigh harms of melatonin or agomelatine when used to prevent onset of a new depressive episode in people with a history of SAD who were free of symptoms when the preventive intervention started. To date, this question has not been examined in a systematic way. This is one of four reviews on the efficacy and potential harms of interventions to prevent SAD. We searched databases up to June 2018 for studies on melatonin or agomelatine for prevention of winter depression. Among 3745 records, we found one randomised controlled study comparing agomelatine with placebo for one year. All 225 participants had a history of winter depression but were not depressed when the prevention study started. The included study showed neither a clear effect in favour nor against agomelatine as a preventive treatment. In addition, the certainty of evidence for all outcomes was very low, making it impossible to draw any conclusions about the efficacy and safety of agomelatine for the prevention of winter depression. No evidence on melatonin for prevention of SAD was identified. Doctors need to discuss with persons with a history of SAD that currently evidence on agomelatine or melatonin for preventive treatment options for SAD is inconclusive, therefore treatment selection should be strongly based on peoples' preferences and reflect on the evidence base of all available treatment options. Review authors recommend that future studies should evaluate the efficacy of agomelatine or melatonin in preventing SAD and should directly compare these interventions against other treatment options, such as light therapy, antidepressants, or psychological therapies to determine the best treatment option for prevention of SAD.",1121,Seasonal affective disorder; major depressive episodes; agomelatine; melatonin; light therapy; psychological therapy; lifestyle interventions,How do the motivations for investigating agomelatine and melatonin for SAD prevention reflect the challenges faced by northern populations?,How can the findings from this review be integrated into future studies for a more definitive conclusion on the use of agomelatine?,Select all of the following that are colors,"Based on the review, what criteria should healthcare providers consider when discussing treatment options for SAD with patients?",How does the report suggest assessing treatment options for SAD prevention?,The seasonal variation in sunlight uniquely affects mental health in these regions.; The general practitioners in these regions prefer these medications.; There is a cultural significance to using these treatments in northern latitudes.,The seasonal variation in sunlight uniquely affects mental health in these regions.,Design studies that directly compare agomelatine with other established treatments.; Limit research to uncontrolled observational studies.; Focus solely on patient preference surveys in future studies.,Design studies that directly compare agomelatine with other established treatments.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Evidence base and patient preferences.; Brand reputation of agomelatine and melatonin.; Cost of treatment as the primary factor.,Evidence base and patient preferences.,Based on patient preferences; Random selection; Popularity of the treatment,Based on patient preferences
5cce9b46b09ec90015f3ef05,static_2,Treatments to reduce body temperature to 35C in people who are in hospital after a traumatic brain injury,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and disability, with an estimated 5.5 million people experiencing severe TBI worldwide every year. Observational clinical studies suggest a link between raised body temperature and unfavourable outcomes, though findings are inconsistent. Preclinical models indicate that reducing temperature to 35C to 37.5C may improve biological outcomes compared to deeper cooling (33C). It remains unknown whether reducing body temperature to 35C in people admitted to hospital with TBI is beneficial, neutral, or harmful. This review updates a previous version published in 2014. We aimed to assess the effects of pharmacological or physical interventions designed to reduce body temperature to 35C in adults and children hospitalised after TBI. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, PubMed, clinical trial registers, grey literature, reference lists, and forward citations up to 28 November 2019. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving participants of any age admitted after TBI and receiving interventions intended to lower body temperature within the target range, including medications (paracetamol, NSAIDs) or physical cooling methods (surface cooling devices, bedside fans, cooled intravenous fluids). Eligible comparators were placebo or usual care. Two authors independently assessed studies, extracted data, and evaluated risk of bias, using GRADE to assess certainty of evidence. Only one RCT with 41 adult participants, conducted in two Australian intensive care units, met the criteria. Participants received intravenous paracetamol (1 g every four hours for 72 hours) or a matched placebo. We were uncertain whether paracetamol influenced 28-day mortality (risk ratio 2.86, 95% CI 0.32 to 25.24). The certainty of evidence was very low due to imprecision (small sample size) and selective reporting concerns, although other risks of bias were low. The study did not report the primary outcome of poor outcome at follow-up (death or dependency) or any secondary outcomes of interest, including intracranial or extracranial haemorrhage, abnormal intracranial pressure, or pneumonia or other serious infections. We found one additional completed trial of a physical intervention (advanced fever control using a surface cooling device versus standard fever control in 12 participants), but it was published only as an abstract with insufficient details for inclusion; it is listed as awaiting classification pending further information. Four ongoing trials may contribute data to future updates if they report relevant outcomes and provide separate results for participants with TBI when mixed populations are included. In conclusion, one small study contributed very low-certainty evidence on mortality. Overall uncertainty is driven by extremely limited research on interventions aimed at reducing body temperature to 35C after TBI. More research evaluating both pharmacological and physical interventions is needed. Future studies should include outcomes important to patients, such as side effects (e.g., nausea, vomiting) and discomfort caused by cooling therapies.","Traumatic brain injury occurs when direct force to the headsuch as from a road traffic accident or a fall causes damage to the brain. It is a major global health problem, affecting about 5.5 million people each year. Injury occurs in two stages: first at the moment of impact, and then over the following hours to weeks as secondary damage develops. Treatment aims to limit this secondary damage. Some evidence suggests that people with normal body temperature after injury may have better outcomes than those with elevated temperatures. This review examined whether medicines or non-drug physical cooling methods that reduce body temperature to between 35C improve outcomes for adults or children hospitalized after traumatic brain injury. We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs)the most reliable type of evidence up to 28 November 2019. Only one small RCT with 41 participants was found. It compared intravenous paracetamol, given for 72 hours, with an intravenous salt solution made to look identical. No published trials assessed other medicines or physical cooling methods such as cooling blankets, ice, fans, or cooled fluids. One very small study of physical cooling was identified but lacked enough information for inclusion, and four ongoing studies may provide future evidence. Some of these include mixed types of brain injury, and we will only be able to use them if they report traumatic brain injury results separately. We were uncertain whether paracetamol reduced deaths within 28 days because the study was very small and did not originally plan to report mortality. It also did not report any of our key outcomes, such as poor functional outcome (death or dependency), serious bleeding inside or outside the brain, raised intracranial pressure, pneumonia, or other infections. Although the study methods were generally sound, the lack of pre-specified reporting increased the risk of bias. With only one small study, the certainty of the evidence was very low, meaning the true effects may be very different from what was reported. Overall, we remain uncertain whether medicines or physical cooling treatments that lower body temperature to 35C benefit people in hospital after traumatic brain injury. More and larger studies are needed, and future updates will assess side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and discomfort, which we hope ongoing and future research will report.",1056,Traumatic brain injury; pharmacological interventions; physical cooling methods; certainty of evidence; imprecision; intracranial pressure; extracranial haemorrhage; pneumonia; advanced fever control,What were the motivations for the study's focus on cooling treatments for TBI?,Which factors contributed to the uncertainty of the study results on paracetamol?,Select all of the following that are colors,"Based on the study, what can be concluded about the use of cooling methods in reducing TBI mortality rates?",Explain the main goal of the study in your own words.,Elevated body temperatures suggest potentially worse outcomes for TBI patients.; Normal body temperature is universally accepted to improve brain injury outcomes.; Cooling treatments have been consistently proven in other unrelated medical contexts.,Elevated body temperatures suggest potentially worse outcomes for TBI patients.,The study used a too short duration of treatment.; The small sample size and lack of pre-planned mortality reporting.; The study confirmed that all key outcomes were reported comprehensively.,The small sample size and lack of pre-planned mortality reporting.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,The study provides strong evidence that cooling methods reduce mortality.; Cooling methods' impact on mortality is uncertain due to the study's limited scope.; Mortality rates increase significantly with the use of cooling methods.,Cooling methods' impact on mortality is uncertain due to the study's limited scope.,To determine if cooling to 35-37.5Â°C improves outcomes after TBI; To establish the best surgical intervention for TBI; To identify genetic markers of TBI,To determine if cooling to 35-37.5Â°C improves outcomes after TBI
5cce9b46b09ec90015f3ef05,static_2,Does the DASH diet help people with or at risk of cardiovascular diseases?,"The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet is designed to lower blood pressure and improve cardiovascular health by reducing sodium and unhealthy fats while increasing nutrients such as potassium, calcium, magnesium, and fibre. While evidence supports its benefits for managing cardiovascular risk factors, gaps remain in understanding its long-term impact on preventing cardiovascular disease, particularly major outcomes like myocardial infarction and stroke. This review assessed the effects of the DASH diet for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. We used standard Cochrane search methods, with the latest search conducted in May 2024. We included randomised controlled trials comparing DASH diet interventions to no intervention, minimal intervention (brief dietary advice or informational leaflets without a structured programme), or other dietary interventions, with adult participants who had or did not have cardiovascular disease. Interventions lasted at least eight weeks, with a minimum follow-up of three months. Primary outcomes were myocardial infarction, heart failure, and stroke; secondary outcomes included revascularisation procedures, all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, changes in blood pressure and blood lipids, incidence of type 2 diabetes, health-related quality of life, and adverse effects. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence. Five trials involving 1397 participants met inclusion criteria; all were primary prevention trials involving generally healthy adults without diagnosed cardiovascular disease. Intervention durations ranged from 16 weeks to 12 months, with follow-up periods up to 18 months. Trials were conducted in the USA and Poland, funded by public institutions. In comparisons of the DASH diet versus no intervention, one small trial reported no myocardial infarctions, strokes, or deaths, with low or very low certainty due to high or unclear risk of bias and imprecision. No data were available for heart failure or revascularisation procedures. In comparisons of the DASH diet versus minimal intervention, two trials reported very few myocardial infarctions and no strokes, with no clear differences between groups (RR for myocardial infarction 2.99, 95% CI 0.12 to 73.04), and no data for heart failure, mortality, or revascularisation outcomes. In comparisons of the DASH diet versus another dietary intervention, one trial reported no clear difference in all-cause mortality (RR 2.98, 95% CI 0.12 to 72.42), with very low certainty of evidence. Across comparisons, the DASH diet may lower blood pressure, total cholesterol, and triglycerides and increase HDL cholesterol relative to no intervention or usual care, but appears to have little to no effect on LDL cholesterol. Reported adverse effects were minimal, though the absence of long-term safety data limits conclusions. Overall, the effects of the DASH diet on major cardiovascular outcomes myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality remain uncertain due to the limited number of trials, small sample sizes, high risk of bias, and short follow-up durations. All included studies evaluated primary prevention, with no evidence for secondary prevention. Well-designed, long-term randomised controlled trials are needed to determine the DASH diets true impact on major cardiovascular events, its role in secondary prevention, and its long-term safety.","Cardiovascular disease refers to conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels, usually caused by a build-up of fatty deposits inside the vessels that can narrow them and lead to blood clots. These clots may block blood flow to the heart and cause a heart attack, or cut off blood supply to the brain and cause a stroke. Cardiovascular disease is a major cause of death and disability, but many cases can be prevented through healthy lifestyle choices. Diet is one of the most important and well-known risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The DASH diet was developed to help lower high blood pressure, a key contributor to heart disease. It focuses on eating fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins, while reducing salt, red meat, and sugar. There is strong evidence that the DASH diet can lower blood pressure, which might help prevent heart disease, but its effects on preventing heart attacks and strokes are not yet fully understood. Prevention can be primary (preventing the first event) or secondary (preventing another event in people who already have heart disease). We wanted to find out whether the DASH diet can prevent cardiovascular diseases in people with or without existing heart disease, and whether it causes any unwanted effects. To answer this, we searched for studies comparing the DASH diet with a regular diet, a minimal intervention (such as general advice or information leaflets), or another structured diet programme like the Mediterranean diet. We summarised the findings and assessed how confident we could be in the evidence. We found five studies involving 1397 people, all of whom did not have cardiovascular disease, meaning the studies assessed the DASH diet for primary prevention only. No studies looked at people who already had cardiovascular disease. The studies lasted between 16 weeks and 18 months and were funded by public or nonprofit organisations, including the US National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute, and the Institute of Cardiology in Poland. Overall, the evidence remains unclear on whether the DASH diet reduces the risk of major cardiovascular events such as heart attacks, strokes, the need for heart procedures, or death from cardiovascular disease. The DASH diet may not cause harmful effects, but the evidence is limited, so we cannot be certain. There were several limitations to the evidence. People in some studies may have known which diet they were following, which could influence results. All studies included participants without cardiovascular disease, leaving us unable to assess whether the DASH diet helps people who already have heart disease. Studies were also small and relatively short, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions about long-term benefits or safety. Larger, well-designed studies with longer follow-up are needed to clarify how effective the DASH diet is at preventing serious heart problems and whether it is safe over the long term.",1046,DASH diet; cardiovascular health; hypertension; myocardial infarction; stroke; cardiovascular disease; primary prevention; secondary prevention; revascularisation procedures; LDL cholesterol,What does the absence of data on secondary prevention reveal about the study's scope regarding cardiovascular disease?,What was the primary focus of the review related to the DASH diet?,Select all of the following that are colors,What are examples of unhealthy dietary components reduced by the DASH diet?,What dietary elements does the DASH diet focus on increasing?,The study provides comprehensive insights into DASH diet effects for all patients.; It highlights a gap in understanding the DASH diet's impact on those with existing heart disease.; The study intentionally excluded secondary prevention for focus on initial prevention.,It highlights a gap in understanding the DASH diet's impact on those with existing heart disease.,Evaluating weight loss results; Preventing cardiovascular diseases; Increasing muscular strength,Preventing cardiovascular diseases,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,"Sodium, red meat, sugar; Fruits and vegetables; Calcium and magnesium","Sodium, red meat, sugar","Fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins; Dairy products and processed foods; Fried foods and sweets","Fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins"
5cce9b46b09ec90015f3ef05,interactive_3,Dietary intake in people living beyond cancer,"International dietary recommendations include guidance on healthy eating and weight management for people who have survived cancer; however dietary interventions are not provided routinely for people living beyond cancer.
To assess the effects of dietary interventions for adult cancer survivors on morbidity and mortality, changes in dietary behaviour, body composition, health-related quality of life, and clinical measurements.
We ran searches on 18 September 2019 and searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials (CENTRAL), in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE via Ovid; Embase via Ovid; the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED); the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL); and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE). We searched other resources including reference lists of retrieved articles, other reviews on the topic, the International Trials Registry for ongoing trials, metaRegister, Physicians Data Query, and appropriate websites for ongoing trials. We searched conference abstracts and WorldCat for dissertations.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that recruited people following a cancer diagnosis. The intervention was any dietary advice provided by any method including group sessions, telephone instruction, written materials, or a web-based approach. We included comparisons that could be usual care or written information, and outcomes measured included overall survival, morbidities, secondary malignancies, dietary changes, anthropometry, quality of life (QoL), and biochemistry.
We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Two people independently assessed titles and full-text articles, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. For analysis, we used a random-effects statistical model for all meta-analyses, and the GRADE approach to rate the certainty of evidence, considering limitations, indirectness, inconsistencies, imprecision, and bias.
We included 25 RCTs involving 7259 participants including 977 (13.5%) men and 6282 (86.5%) women. Mean age reported ranged from 52.6 to 71 years, and range of age of included participants was 23 to 85 years. The trials reported 27 comparisons and included participants who had survived breast cancer (17 trials), colorectal cancer (2 trials), gynaecological cancer (1 trial), and cancer at mixed sites (5 trials). For overall survival, dietary intervention and control groups showed little or no difference in risk of mortality (hazard ratio (HR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77 to 1.23; 1 study; 3107 participants; low-certainty evidence). For secondary malignancies, dietary interventions versus control trials reported little or no difference (risk ratio (RR) 0.99, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.15; 1 study; 3107 participants; low-certainty evidence). Co-morbidities were not measured in any included trials. Subsequent outcomes reported after 12 months found that dietary interventions versus control probably make little or no difference in energy intake at 12 months (mean difference (MD) -59.13 kcal, 95% CI -159.05 to 37.79; 5 studies; 3283 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Dietary interventions versus control probably led to slight increases in fruit and vegetable servings (MD 0.41 servings, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.71; 5 studies; 834 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); mixed results for fibre intake overall (MD 5.12 g, 95% CI 0.66 to 10.9; 2 studies; 3127 participants; very low-certainty evidence); and likely improvement in Diet Quality Index (MD 3.46, 95% CI 1.54 to 5.38; 747 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). For anthropometry, dietary intervention versus control probably led to a slightly decreased body mass index (BMI) (MD -0.79 kg/m², 95% CI -1.50 to -0.07; 4 studies; 777 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Dietary interventions versus control probably had little or no effect on waist-to-hip ratio (MD -0.01, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.02; 2 studies; 106 participants; low-certainty evidence). For QoL, there were mixed results; several different quality assessment tools were used and evidence was of low to very low-certainty. No adverse events were reported in any of the included studies.
Evidence demonstrated little effects of dietary interventions on overall mortality and secondary cancers. For comorbidities, no evidence was identified. For nutritional outcomes, there was probably little or no effect on energy intake, although probably a slight increase in fruit and vegetable intake and Diet Quality Index. Results were mixed for fibre. For anthropometry, there was probably a slight decrease in body mass index (BMI) but probably little or no effect on waist-to-hip ratio. For QoL, results were highly varied. Additional high-quality research is needed to examine the effects of dietary interventions for different cancer sites, and to evaluate important outcomes including comorbidities and body composition. Evidence on new technologies used to deliver dietary interventions was limited.","Diet has been linked to cancer, and dietary guidelines are available for cancer prevention. People after cancer have been found to have higher rates of other conditions including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and other cancers. It is therefore sensible for people after cancer to look at changing their diet. It was important to undertake this review to assess the evidence on dietary advice for people who have survived cancer. This review evaluates evidence on dietary interventions for people after cancer. The quality of evidence is generally low to very low. Most studies did not evaluate dietary interventions for key review outcomes, particularly mortality and morbidity. However, a few study outcomes with moderate-certainty evidence focused on dietary intake and physical measurements. Included studies compared dietary interventions versus control or usual care. We pooled data from similar randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to provide a summary estimate of the effects of an intervention, and we judged how confident (certain) we were of these findings by using an established method (GRADE). We identified 25 RCTs involving 27 different comparisons. For some outcomes, we found absence of evidence for dietary interventions. We found some evidence showing that dietary interventions probably did not modify energy intake; however, some evidence shows what is probably a slight increase in fruit and vegetable intake (moderate-certainty evidence). Evidence on dietary fibre was mixed for different advice on weight reducing or healthy eating. Dietary interventions compared to control probably improved the Diet Quality Index (moderate-certainty evidence). For physical measurements, we found a probable reduction in body mass index (BMI) with dietary interventions compared to controls (moderate-certainty evidence) but little evidence showing any change in waist-to-hip ratio (low-certainty evidence). For quality of life (QoL), results were mixed due to the wide variety of tools used. No adverse events were reported. Available evidence shows that dietary interventions can be helpful in modifying fruit and vegetable servings and diet quality; modification of fibre intake was variable, and some benefits were seen for anthropometric measurements, including BMI. Most of the evidence is based on women with breast cancer, so more research is needed for patients with other cancers.

5cce9b46b09ec90015f3ef05,interactive_4,Statins can help reduce risk of death in people with chronic kidney disease who do not need dialysis,"Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in people with early-stage chronic kidney disease (CKD), and their absolute risk of cardiovascular events is similar to that of people with coronary artery disease. This updated review evaluated whether statins benefit adults with CKD not requiring dialysis by reducing cardiovascular events, death, or kidney decline, compared with placebo, no treatment, usual care, or other statins. We included 63 studies involving 50,725 participants, most of which compared statins with placebo or no treatment, with a median follow-up of 12 months and typical doses equivalent to 20 mg/day of simvastatin. Participants had a median eGFR of 55 mL/min/1.73 m2. Across 43 studies that could be meta-analysed, statins clearly reduced major cardiovascular events, with a 28% relative reduction, and reduced overall death and cardiovascular death. Statins also lowered the risk of myocardial infarction, though data were insufficient to determine whether they influenced hospitalisations for heart failure. Statins probably made little or no difference in preventing stroke or kidney failure in people with CKD not on dialysis. Evidence on harms was limited due to insufficient reporting, but available data suggest statins may have little or no effect on elevated liver enzymes, withdrawals due to side effects, or cancer. Too few studies reported rhabdomyolysis or elevated creatine kinase to determine whether statins increase these risks. Statins showed clear benefits when used for primary prevention, reducing death and major cardiovascular events in people with CKD who did not have cardiovascular disease at baseline. However, there were insufficient data to determine whether one statin was better than another. Overall, statins reduce the risk of death and major cardiovascular events in people with CKD not requiring dialysis, while their effects on muscle-related toxicity remain uncertain due to limited reporting.","Adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have a high risk of cardiovascular events, with elevated serum cholesterol and triglycerides, a factor that contributes to cardiovascular disease. Statin therapy helps to lower the level of bad cholesterol (low-density lipoprotein) and has cardiovascular protective effects beyond cholesterol reduction. For people not needing dialysis, statin therapy has been shown to reduce death and cardiovascular events. Still, studies in this population have shown unclear effects on stroke, kidney failure, and harms such as muscle damage (rhabdomyolysis).
We looked at 62 studies published before 4 October 2023 concerning statins in over 50,000 people with CKD who did not need dialysis treatment. This review is a living systematic review. A search for new evidence will be conducted every three months, and the review will be updated accordingly. We found that compared to placebo, statin therapy reduced death and major heart-related events, with one in 13 people receiving statin therapy avoiding heart-related events and one in 26 people avoiding death. Statin therapy probably had little or no effect on stroke and kidney failure (when people would benefit from dialysis or a kidney transplant). The benefits of statin therapy were also evident in patients with CKD but not heart disease. Statins have some potential harms; however, we found there was probably no effect on cancer, liver function or withdrawing from treatment due to adverse events. There was limited reporting of muscle damage in the studies. Studies did not identify a preferred type or dose of statin in treating people with CKD not requiring dialysis. Statins decrease death, major cardiovascular events, and myocardial infarction in people with moderate CKD.

5cce9b46b09ec90015f3ef05,interactive_4,"Diet, physical activity or both for prevention or delay of type 2 diabetes mellitus and its associated complications in people at increased risk","The projected rise in the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) could develop into a substantial health problem worldwide. Whether diet, physical activity or both can prevent or delay T2DM and its associated complications in at-risk people is unknown. To assess the effects of diet, physical activity or both on the prevention or delay of T2DM and its associated complications in people at increased risk of developing T2DM.
This is an update of the Cochrane Review published in 2008. We searched the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP Search Portal and reference lists of systematic reviews, articles and health technology assessment reports. The date of the last search of all databases was January 2017. We continuously used a MEDLINE email alert service to identify newly published studies using the same search strategy as described for MEDLINE up to September 2017. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a duration of two years or more. We used standard Cochrane methodology for data collection and analysis. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence using GRADE. We included 12 RCTs randomising 5238 people. One trial contributed 41% of all participants. The duration of the interventions varied from two to six years. We judged none of the included trials at low risk of bias for all 'Risk of bias' domains. Eleven trials compared diet plus physical activity with standard or no treatment. Nine RCTs included participants with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), one RCT included participants with IGT, impaired fasting blood glucose (IFG) or both, and one RCT included people with fasting glucose levels between 5.3 to 6.9 mmol/L. A total of 12 deaths occurred in 2049 participants in the diet plus physical activity groups compared with 10 in 2050 participants in the comparator groups (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.50; 95% prediction interval 0.44 to 2.88; 4099 participants, 10 trials; very low-quality evidence). The definition of T2DM incidence varied among the included trials. Altogether 315 of 2122 diet plus physical activity participants (14.8%) developed T2DM compared with 614 of 2389 comparator participants (25.7%) (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.64; 95% prediction interval 0.50 to 0.65; 4511 participants, 11 trials; moderate-quality evidence). Two trials reported serious adverse events. In one trial no adverse events occurred. In the other trial one of 51 diet plus physical activity participants compared with none of 51 comparator participants experienced a serious adverse event (low-quality evidence). Cardiovascular mortality was rarely reported (four of 1626 diet plus physical activity participants and four of 1637 comparator participants (the RR ranged between 0.94 and 3.16; 3263 participants, 7 trials; very low-quality evidence). Only one trial reported that no non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke had occurred (low-quality evidence). Two trials reported that none of the participants had experienced hypoglycaemia. One trial investigated health-related quality of life in 2144 participants and noted that a minimal important difference between intervention groups was not reached (very low-quality evidence). Three trials evaluated costs of the interventions in 2755 participants. The largest trial of these reported an analysis of costs from the health system perspective and society perspective reflecting USD 31,500 and USD 51,600 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) with diet plus physical activity, respectively (low-quality evidence). There were no data on blindness or end-stage renal disease. One trial compared a diet-only intervention with a physical-activity intervention or standard treatment. The participants had IGT. Three of 130 participants in the diet group compared with none of the 141 participants in the physical activity group died (very low-quality evidence). None of the participants died because of cardiovascular disease (very low-quality evidence). Altogether 57 of 130 diet participants (43.8%) compared with 58 of 141 physical activity participants (41.1%) group developed T2DM (very low-quality evidence). No adverse events were recorded (very low-quality evidence). There were no data on non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, blindness, end-stage renal disease, health-related quality of life or socioeconomic effects. Two trials compared physical activity with standard treatment in 397 participants. One trial included participants with IGT, the other trial included participants with IGT, IFG or both. One trial reported that none of the 141 physical activity participants compared with three of 133 control participants died. The other trial reported that three of 84 physical activity participants and one of 39 control participants died (very low-quality evidence). In one trial T2DM developed in 58 of 141 physical activity participants (41.1%) compared with 90 of 133 control participants (67.7%). In the other trial 10 of 84 physical activity participants (11.9%) compared with seven of 39 control participants (18%) developed T2DM (very low-quality evidence). Serious adverse events were rarely reported (one trial noted no events, one trial described events in three of 66 physical activity participants compared with one of 39 control participants - very low-quality evidence). Only one trial reported on cardiovascular mortality (none of 274 participants died - very low-quality evidence). Non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke were rarely observed in the one trial randomising 123 participants (very low-quality evidence). One trial reported that none of the participants in the trial experienced hypoglycaemia. One trial investigating health-related quality of life in 123 participants showed no substantial differences between intervention groups (very low-quality evidence). There were no data on blindness or socioeconomic effects. There is no firm evidence that diet alone or physical activity alone compared to standard treatment influences the risk of T2DM and especially its associated complications in people at increased risk of developing T2DM. However, diet plus physical activity reduces or delays the incidence of T2DM in people with IGT. Data are lacking for the effect of diet plus physical activity for people with intermediate hyperglycaemia defined by other glycaemic variables. Most RCTs did not investigate patient-important outcomes.","People with moderately elevated blood glucose (often referred to as 'prediabetes') are said to be at an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. It is currently recommended that all people with increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes should adjust their eating habits and physical activity levels. We wanted to find out whether these changes in diet, physical activity or both could prevent or delay type 2 diabetes in people at increased risk. We also wanted to know the effects on patient-important outcomes, such as complications of diabetes (e.g. kidney and eye disease, heart attack, stroke), death from any cause, health-related quality of life (a measure of a person's satisfaction with their life and health) and side-effects. Participants had to have blood glucose levels higher than considered normal, but below the glucose levels that are used to diagnose type 2 diabetes mellitus. We found 12 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) with 5238 participants. The duration of the treatments varied from two years to six years. Most trials included people defined as being at increased risk of type 2 diabetes based on glucose levels measured two hours after ingestion of 75 g of glucose (i.e. 'impaired glucose tolerance' (IGT) after an oral glucose tolerance test). This evidence is up to date as of January 2017. We used a MEDLINE email alert service to identify newly published studies up to September 2017. One study compared diet only with physical activity only. Fifty-seven of 130 participants (44%) in the diet-only group compared with 58 of 141 participants (41%) in the physical activity-only group developed type 2 diabetes. Two studies compared physical activity with standard treatment; in one study 58 of 141 participants (41%) in the physical activity group compared with 90 of 133 participants (68%) in the control group developed type 2 diabetes; in the other study 10 of 84 participants (12%) in the physical activity group compared with seven out of 39 participants (18%) in the control group developed type 2 diabetes. Eleven studies compared diet plus physical activity with standard or no treatment. Diet plus physical activity decreased the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, which occurred in 315 of 2122 participants (15%) in the diet plus physical activity group compared with 614 of 2389 participants (26%) in the standard treatment group. We detected neither an advantage nor a disadvantage of diet, physical activity or both with regard to heart attacks or strokes. Our included studies did not report on complications of diabetes such as kidney or eye disease. The effects on health-related quality of life were inconclusive. Very few participants died in the course of the studies and side-effects were also rare. Future long-term studies should investigate more patient-important outcomes like complications of diabetes, because we do not know for sure whether prediabetes is just a condition arbitrarily defined by a laboratory measurement or is, in fact, a real risk factor for type 2 diabetes mellitus and whether treatment of this condition translates into better patient-important outcomes. All included trials had deficiencies in the way that they were conducted or how key items were reported. For diet plus physical activity compared with standard treatment, we found rather good evidence that the development of new type 2 diabetes was reduced or delayed. For the other comparisons the number of participants was small, resulting in a high risk of random errors (play of chance).",1011,Type 2 diabetes mellitus; randomised controlled trials; impaired glucose tolerance; fasting blood glucose; serious adverse events; cardiovascular mortality; myocardial infarction; non-fatal stroke; hypoglycaemia; health-related quality of life,In what ways could the lack of reported diabetes complications data affect the interpretation of study results?,What was the primary objective of the study?,Select all of the following that are fruits,Describe the effect of diet plus physical activity on developing type 2 diabetes compared with standard treatment.,Identify the outcomes that were not conclusively affected by the interventions.,It may limit understanding of the full benefits of interventions.; It confirms the absence of any complications from diabetes.; It enhances the credibility of the studies by focusing only on T2DM incidence.,It may limit understanding of the full benefits of interventions.,Investigate whether diet and physical activity prevent type 2 diabetes.; Compare different types of medications for type 2 diabetes.; Evaluate the prevalence of type 2 diabetes worldwide.,Investigate whether diet and physical activity prevent type 2 diabetes.,dog; blue; grape,grape,It decreased the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.; It increased the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.; It had no effect on the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.,It decreased the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.,Health-related quality of life.; Blood glucose levels.; Body mass index.,Health-related quality of life.
5cce9b46b09ec90015f3ef05,finetuned_5,Do education programmes improve outcomes in people with both chronic kidney disease and diabetes?,"Adherence to complex regimens for people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes is often poor. Interventions to enhance adherence require intensive education and behavioural counselling. However, whether the existing evidence is scientifically rigorous and can support recommendations for routine use of educational programmes in people with CKD and diabetes is still unknown. This is an update of a review first published in 2011.
To evaluate the benefits and harms of education programmes for people with CKD and diabetes. We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 19 July 2024 using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs investigating the benefits and harms of educational programmes (information and behavioural instructions and advice given by a healthcare provider, who could be a nurse, pharmacist, educator, health professional, medical practitioner, or healthcare provider, through verbal, written, audio-recording, or computer-aided modalities) for people 18 years and older with CKD and diabetes.
Two authors independently screened the literature, determined study eligibility, assessed quality, and extracted and entered data. We expressed dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and continuous data as mean difference (MD) with 95% CI. Data were pooled using the random-effects model. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Eight studies (13 reports, 840 randomised participants) were included. The overall risk of bias was low for objective outcomes and attrition bias, unclear for selection bias, reporting bias and other biases, and high for subjective outcomes. Education programmes compared to routine care alone probably decrease glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) (4 studies, 467 participants: MD -0.42%, 95% CI -0.53 to -0.31; moderate certainty evidence; 13.5 months follow-up) and may decrease total cholesterol (179 participants: MD -0.35 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.63 to -00.07; low certainty evidence) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (179 participants: MD -0.40 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.65 to -0.14; low certainty evidence) at 18 months of follow-up. One study (83 participants) reported education programmes for people receiving dialysis who have diabetes may improve the diabetes knowledge of diagnosis, monitoring, hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia, medication with insulin, oral medication, personal health habits, diet, exercise, chronic complications, and living with diabetes and coping with stress (all low certainty evidence). There may be an improvement in the general knowledge of diabetes at the end of the intervention and at the end of the three-month follow-up (one study, 97 participants; low certainty evidence) in people with diabetes and moderately increased albuminuria (A2). In participants with diabetes and moderately increased albuminuria (A2) (one study, 97 participants), education programmes may improve a participantÃÆÃÆÃâÃÂ¢ÃÆÃâÃâÃâ¬ÃÆÃâÃâÃâ¢s beliefs in treatment effectiveness and total self-efficacy at the end of five weeks compared to routine care (low certainty evidence). Self-efficacy for in-home blood glucose monitoring and beliefs in personal control may increase at the end of the three-month follow-up (low certainty evidence). There were no differences in other self-efficacy measures. One study (100 participants) reported an education programme may increase change in behaviour for general diet, specific diet and home blood glucose monitoring at the end of treatment (low certainty evidence); however, at the end of three months of follow-up, there may be no difference in any behaviour change outcomes (all low certainty evidence). There were uncertain effects on death, serious hypoglycaemia, and kidney failure due to very low certainty evidence. No data was available for changes in kidney function (creatinine clearance, serum creatinine, doubling of serum creatinine or proteinuria). For an education programme plus multidisciplinary, co-ordinated care compared to routine care, there may be little or no difference in HbA1c, kidney failure, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), systolic or diastolic blood pressure, hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia, and LDL and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (all low certainty evidence in participants with type-2 diabetes mellitus and documented advanced diabetic nephropathy). There were no data for death, patient-orientated measures, change in kidney function (other than eGFR and albuminuria), cardiovascular disease morbidity, quality of life, or adverse events. Education programmes may improve knowledge of some areas related to diabetes care and some self-management practices. Education programmes probably decrease HbA1c in people with CKD and diabetes, but the effect on other clinical outcomes is unclear. This review only included eight studies with small sample sizes. Therefore, more randomised studies are needed to examine the efficacy of education programmes on important clinical outcomes in people with CKD and diabetes.","Chronic kidney disease (a long-term condition where the kidneys do not work effectively) and diabetes (a lifelong condition that causes a person's blood sugar level to become too high) are chronic conditions that bring on many challenges for people, particularly when they have to manage both at the same time. Diabetes can accelerate the development of kidney disease and is the leading cause of kidney failure (a condition where the kidneys no longer function well enough to keep a person alive). While sticking to complex treatment plans can be challenging, successful self-management in the early stages of kidney disease can improve outcomes later in life and delay the need for dialysis or a kidney transplant. Education programmes are any set of planned activities designed to improve a person's ability to manage their condition and delay the progression of their kidney disease. These activities can aim to improve a person's knowledge of their disease, self-care activities, and their ability to self-monitor the disease, thus encouraging and motivating them to create healthy lifestyle changes, improve their treatment compliance, and improve quality of life. We wanted to find out whether an education programme designed for people with both kidney disease and diabetes helps them understand their condition and recognise the importance of strategies aimed at slowing its progression and preventing long-term complications. We searched for randomised studies (studies in which participants are assigned randomly to two or more treatment groups) that compared education programmes to usual care for people with both kidney disease and diabetes. We compared and summarised the results and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and sizes.
We included eight studies involving 840 people 18 years or older with both kidney disease and diabetes. Four studies were undertaken in multiple centres, and four studies were performed in single centres. The duration of follow-up ranged from 12 weeks to four years. Most of the education programmes were designed to increase a person's knowledge of their condition and improve self-management behaviours. One study focused on reducing stress using mindfulness (a person's ability to be aware of where they are and what they are doing), and it was adapted to include practices for complex thoughts and feelings related to diabetes, and one study used a co-ordinated medical care approach with multiple practitioners involved in a person's care. Overall, education programmes probably lower blood glucose levels and may lower total cholesterol and blood pressure, but may make little or no difference to kidney function, abnormally low or high blood sugar, and cardiovascular disease (disorders of the heart and blood vessels). For people with diabetes on dialysis (a procedure to remove waste products and excess fluid from the blood when the kidneys stop working properly), an education programme may improve their knowledge of diabetes, self-management behaviour for checking their feet, using lotion, wearing appropriate shoes and socks, and coping with stress. For people with moderately increased protein in the urine, there may be an improvement in their general knowledge of diabetes, their confidence in monitoring their blood sugar levels at home, their beliefs in their personal control, as well as behavioural changes to their diet. There may be no behavioural changes to exercise, foot care, or quitting smoking.
We have low confidence in education programmes improving the understanding of diabetes in people with kidney disease.

5cce9b46b09ec90015f3ef05,finetuned_6,Is metformin an effective treatment for adults with type 2 diabetes?,"Worldwide, there is an increasing incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Metformin is still the recommended first-line glucose-lowering drug for people with T2DM. Despite this, the effects of metformin on patient-important outcomes are still not clarified.
To assess the effects of metformin monotherapy in adults with T2DM.
We based our search on a systematic report from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and topped-up the search in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, WHO ICTRP, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Additionally, we searched the reference lists of included trials and systematic reviews, as well as health technology assessment reports and medical agencies. The date of the last search for all databases was 2 December 2019, except Embase (searched up 28 April 2017).
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with at least one year's duration comparing metformin monotherapy with no intervention, behaviour changing interventions or other glucose-lowering drugs in adults with T2DM.
Two review authors read all abstracts and full-text articles/records, assessed risk of bias, and extracted outcome data independently. We resolved discrepancies by involvement of a third review author. For meta-analyses we used a random-effects model with investigation of risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes, using 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for effect estimates. We assessed the overall certainty of the evidence by using the GRADE instrument.
We included 18 RCTs with multiple study arms (N = 10,680). The percentage of participants finishing the trials was approximately 58% in all groups. Treatment duration ranged from one to 10.7 years. We judged no trials to be at low risk of bias on all 'Risk of bias' domains. The main outcomes of interest were all-cause mortality, serious adverse events (SAEs), health-related quality of life (HRQoL), cardiovascular mortality (CVM), non-fatal myocardial infarction (NFMI), non-fatal stroke (NFS), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Two trials compared metformin (N = 370) with insulin (N = 454). Neither trial reported on all-cause mortality, SAE, CVM, NFMI, NFS or ESRD. One trial provided information on HRQoL but did not show a substantial difference between the interventions. Seven trials compared metformin with sulphonylureas. Four trials reported on all-cause mortality: in three trials no participant died, and in the remaining trial 31/1454 participants (2.1%) in the metformin group died compared with 31/1441 participants (2.2%) in the sulphonylurea group (very low-certainty evidence). Three trials reported on SAE: in two trials no SAE occurred (186 participants); in the other trial 331/1454 participants (22.8%) in the metformin group experienced a SAE compared with 308/1441 participants (21.4%) in the sulphonylurea group (very low-certainty evidence). Two trials reported on CVM: in one trial no CVM was observed and in the other trial 4/1441 participants (0.3%) in the metformin group died of cardiovascular reasons compared with 8/1447 participants (0.6%) in the sulphonylurea group (very low-certainty evidence). Three trials reported on NFMI: in two trials no NFMI occurred, and in the other trial 21/1454 participants (1.4%) in the metformin group experienced a NFMI compared with 15/1441 participants (1.0%) in the sulphonylurea group (very low-certainty evidence). One trial reported no NFS occurred (very low-certainty evidence). No trial reported on HRQoL or ESRD. Seven trials compared metformin with thiazolidinediones (very low-certainty evidence for all outcomes). Five trials reported on all-cause mortality: in two trials no participant died; the overall RR was 0.88, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.39; P = 0.57; 5 trials; 4402 participants). Four trials reported on SAE, the RR was 0,95, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.09; P = 0.49; 3208 participants. Four trials reported on CVM, the RR was 0.71, 95% CI 0.21 to 2.39; P = 0.58; 3211 participants. Three trial reported on NFMI: in two trials no NFMI occurred and in one trial 21/1454 participants (1.4%) in the metformin group experienced a NFMI compared with 25/1456 participants (1.7%) in the thiazolidinedione group. One trial reported no NFS occurred. No trial reported on HRQoL or ESRD. Three trials compared metformin with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (one trial each with saxagliptin, sitagliptin, vildagliptin with altogether 1977 participants). There was no substantial difference between the interventions for all-cause mortality, SAE, CVM, NFMI and NFS (very low-certainty evidence for all outcomes). One trial compared metformin with a glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue (very low-certainty evidence for all reported outcomes). There was no substantial difference between the interventions for all-cause mortality, CVM, NFMI and NFS. One or more SAEs were reported in 16/268 (6.0%) of the participants allocated to metformin compared with 35/539 (6.5%) of the participants allocated to a glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue. HRQoL or ESRD were not reported. One trial compared metformin with meglitinide and two trials compared metformin with no intervention. No deaths or SAEs occurred (very low-certainty evidence)no other patient-important outcomes were reported. No trial compared metformin with placebo or a behaviour changing interventions. Four ongoing trials with 5824 participants are likely to report one or more of our outcomes of interest and are estimated to be completed between 2018 and 2024. Furthermore, 24 trials with 2369 participants are awaiting assessment.
There is no clear evidence whether metformin monotherapy compared with no intervention, behaviour changing interventions or other glucose-lowering drugs influences patient-important outcomes.","Type 2 diabetes is a condition that causes high levels of sugar in the blood. Blood sugar levels are controlled by insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas. Insulin instructs the liver, muscles and fat cells to remove sugar from the blood and store it. When the pancreas does not make enough insulin, or the body does not respond to insulin, too much sugar stays in the blood. Many medicines for treating type 2 diabetes are available. These aim to lower the amount of sugar in the blood and reduce long-term complications of diabetes. The first medicine that is usually prescribed to people with type 2 diabetes is metformin. Metformin works by reducing the amount of sugar that the liver releases into the blood. It also improves the way the body responds to insulin. We wanted to find out whether metformin is an effective treatment for type 2 diabetes, and whether it causes any unwanted effects. We also wanted to compare its effects with other antidiabetic medicines, and with diets, exercise or both. The outcomes we were specifically interested in were death, serious unwanted events, health-related quality of life, death from cardiovascular causes, and non-fatal complications of diabetes (for example heart attacks, strokes or kidney failure). We searched medical databases for studies that were randomised controlled trials, which are medical studies where participants are put randomly into one of the treatment groups and provide the most reliable evidence about whether treatments make a difference; included people aged 18 years or older with type 2 diabetes; compared metformin with a placebo (fake treatment), no treatment, diet programmes, or another medicine that lowers blood sugar; and lasted at least one year. We found 18 studies with multiple study arms including a total of 10,680 participants. The studies lasted between one year and approximately 11 years. They compared metformin with insulin injections (two studies); other medicines that lower blood sugar levels such as sulphonylureas (seven studies), thiazolidinediones (seven studies), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (three studies), a glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue (one study), and a meglitinide (one study); and no treatment (two studies). No study compared metformin with a placebo or with diet or exercise programmes. Almost all studies investigated laboratory measurements of blood sugar control like fasting blood glucose. However, there was little information on patient-important outcomes such as death, serious unwanted events, health-related quality of life, death from cardiovascular causes, and non-fatal complications of diabetes when comparing metformin with other medicines, placebo or no intervention. The available data did not show any clear benefit or harm of metformin. Four ongoing studies with 5824 participants will report one or more of our outcomes of interest and will be completed between 2018 and 2024. Furthermore, 24 studies with 2369 participants could be used in a future update of our review once results are published.",1005,type 2 diabetes mellitus; metformin monotherapy; serious adverse events; non-fatal myocardial infarction; health-related quality of life; end-stage renal disease; sulphonylureas; thiazolidinediones; dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors; glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue,In what ways do the study's findings challenge the standard use of metformin as a first-line treatment for T2DM?,"Given the study's findings, how should metformin's role be reassessed in the context of other glucose-lowering therapies?",Select the items that are animals,What is the primary focus of the study regarding metformin?,What did the study find about metformin's comparison with other medicines?,The absence of significant differences in serious adverse events; Metformin's superior effect on cardiovascular outcomes; The lack of evidence on health-related quality of life improvements,The absence of significant differences in serious adverse events; The lack of evidence on health-related quality of life improvements,As a similar option with unclear additional benefits; As the most effective option for preventing diabetes complications; As a supplementary treatment to other therapies,As a similar option with unclear additional benefits,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,To evaluate its efficacy and safety as a treatment for type 2 diabetes.; To compare its effects with insulin in type 1 diabetes patients.; To determine its production methods.,To evaluate its efficacy and safety as a treatment for type 2 diabetes.,No clear benefit or harm compared to other treatments.; Significantly better at preventing complications.; Worse at controlling blood sugar levels.,No clear benefit or harm compared to other treatments.
5cce9b46b09ec90015f3ef05,finetuned_6,What are the benefits and risks of using steroids for treating nephrotic syndrome in children?,"In nephrotic syndrome, protein leaks from the blood into the urine through the glomeruli, resulting in hypoproteinaemia and generalised oedema. While most children with nephrotic syndrome respond to corticosteroids, 80% experience a relapsing course. Corticosteroids have reduced the death rate to around 3%; however, corticosteroids have well-recognised potentially serious adverse events such as obesity, poor growth, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, cataracts, glaucoma and behavioural disturbances. This is an update of a review first published in 2000 and updated in 2002, 2005, 2007, 2015 and 2020. The aim of this review was to assess the benefits and harms of different corticosteroid regimens in children with steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SSNS). The benefits and harms of therapy were studied in two groups of children: 1) children in their initial episode of SSNS and 2) children who experience a relapsing course of SSNS. We contacted the Information Specialist and searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 9 July 2024 using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) performed in children (one to 18 years) during their initial or subsequent episode of SSNS, comparing different durations, total doses or other dose strategies using any corticosteroid agent. Summary estimates of effects were obtained using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. In this 2024 update, we included five new studies, resulting in 54 studies randomising 4670 children. Risk of bias methodology was often poorly performed, with only 31 studies and 28 studies respectively assessed to be at low risk for random sequence generation and allocation concealment. Ten studies were at low risk of performance bias (blinding of participants and personnel), and 12 studies were at low risk of detection bias (blinding of outcome assessment); nine of these studies were placebo-controlled RCTs. Twenty-seven studies (fewer than 50%) were at low risk for attrition bias, and 26 studies were at low risk for reporting bias (selective outcome reporting). In studies at low risk of selection bias evaluating children in their initial episode of SSNS, there is little or no difference in the number of children with frequent relapses when comparing two months of prednisone with three months or more (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.10; 755 children, 5 studies; I2= 0%; high certainty evidence) or when comparing three months with five to seven months of therapy (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.33; 376 children, 3 studies; I2= 35%; high certainty evidence). In analyses of studies at low risk of selection bias, there is little or no difference in the number of children with any relapse by 12 to 24 months when comparing two months of prednisone with three months or more (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.06; 808 children; 6 studies; I2= 47%) or when comparing three months with five to seven months of therapy (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.11; 377 children, 3 studies; I2= 53%). Little or no difference was noted in adverse events between the different treatment durations. Amongst children with relapsing SSNS, four small studies (177 children) utilising lower doses of prednisone compared with standard regimens found little or no differences between groups in the numbers with relapse (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.20; I2= 0%). A fifth study (117 children) reported little or no difference between two weeks and four weeks of alternate-day prednisone after remission with daily prednisone. A recent large, well-designed study with 271 children found that administering daily prednisone compared with alternate-day prednisone or no prednisone during viral infection did not reduce the risk of relapse. In contrast, four previous small studies in children with frequently relapsing disease had reported that daily prednisone during viral infections compared with alternate-day prednisone or no treatment reduced the risk of relapse. There are four well-designed studies randomising 823 children, which have demonstrated that there is no benefit of prolonging prednisone therapy beyond two to three months in the first episode of SSNS. Small studies in children with relapsing disease have identified no differences in efficacy using lower induction doses or shorter durations of prednisone therapy. Large, well-designed studies are required to confirm these findings. While previous small studies had suggested that changing from alternate-day to daily prednisone therapy at the onset of infection reduced the likelihood of relapse, a much larger and well-designed study found no reduction in the number relapsing when administering daily prednisone at the onset of infection.","Nephrotic syndrome is a condition in which the kidneys leak protein from the blood into the urine, and if left untreated, children can develop serious infections. In most children, this protein leak stops with steroid treatment because steroids are strong anti-inflammatory medicines, but they can also cause significant side effects such as depression, anxiety, high blood pressure, cataracts, increased infection risk, weight gain, and slowed growth. Children may also experience repeated episodes of nephrotic syndrome, often triggered by viral infections. We wanted to determine the best treatment options for children with nephrotic syndrome to stop protein leakage while avoiding harmful steroid side effects. We searched for all studies that compared the benefits and risks of different steroid regimens in children experiencing nephrotic syndrome for the first time or in those with frequent repeat episodes. We identified 54 studies involving 4670 children from around the world, many from South Asia. Twenty-three studies compared shorter courses of prednisone lasting two to three months with longer courses lasting three to seven months in children experiencing their first episode. The remaining studies looked at children with frequent relapses. We found that longer courses of prednisone (three to seven months) did not meaningfully reduce the chance of a child experiencing another episode or becoming someone who has frequent repeat episodes, compared with shorter two- to three-month courses. The side effects appeared similar between shorter and longer treatments, although many studies did not report this information clearly. Overall, the evidence shows that children experiencing nephrotic syndrome for the first time only need two to three months of prednisone because extending treatment does not lower the risk of relapses. However, we are less confident regarding side effects since many studies did not provide enough usable information.",1085,nephrotic syndrome; hypoproteinaemia; oedema; corticosteroids; steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome; prednisone; glomeruli; alternate-day prednisone; frequently relapsing; remission,Name a motivation for the study according to the plain-language summary.,State a key finding regarding the duration of prednisone treatment.,Select the items that are animals,Explain the goal of reviewing different steroid regimens.,Paraphrase the study's conclusion on treatment duration.,To find the most effective steroid regimens; To determine if steroid therapy is outdated; To evaluate new surgical techniques,To find the most effective steroid regimens,Longer courses reduce the chance of episodes; Shorter courses are as effective as longer courses; Only intravenous doses are effective,Shorter courses are as effective as longer courses,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,To balance efficacy and side effects; To eliminate steroid usage entirely; To improve patient dietary plans,To balance efficacy and side effects,Extending treatment beyond two to three months is unnecessary; Seven-month treatments are significantly better; All patients benefit most from indefinite treatment,Extending treatment beyond two to three months is unnecessary
60e769ec9858960e8ad00886,static_1,Bisphosphonates and denosumab for breast cancer,"Bone is the most common site of metastatic disease associated with breast cancer (BC). Bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, and novel targeted therapies such as denosumab inhibit other key bone metabolism pathways. We have studied these agents in both early breast cancer and advanced breast cancer settings. This is an update of the review originally published in 2002 and subsequently updated in 2005 and 2012.
To assess the effects of bisphosphonates and other bone agents in addition to anti-cancer treatment: (i) in women with early breast cancer (EBC); (ii) in women with advanced breast cancer without bone metastases (ABC); and (iii) in women with metastatic breast cancer and bone metastases (BCBM).
In this review update, we searched Cochrane Breast Cancer's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov on 19 September 2016.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing: (a) one treatment with a bisphosphonate/bone-acting agent with the same treatment without a bisphosphonate/bone-acting agent; (b) treatment with one bisphosphonate versus treatment with a different bisphosphonate; (c) treatment with a bisphosphonate versus another bone-acting agent of a different mechanism of action (e.g. denosumab); and (d) immediate treatment with a bisphosphonate/bone-acting agent versus delayed treatment of the same bisphosphonate/bone-acting agent.
Two review authors independently extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and quality of the evidence. The primary outcome measure was bone metastases for EBC and ABC, and a skeletal-related event (SRE) for BCBM. We derived risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and the meta-analyses used random-effects models. Secondary outcomes included overall survival and disease-free survival for EBC; we derived hazard ratios (HRs) for these time-to-event outcomes where possible. We collected toxicity and quality-of-life information. GRADE was used to assess the quality of evidence for the most important outcomes in each treatment setting.
We included 44 RCTs involving 37,302 women. In women with EBC, bisphosphonates were associated with a reduced risk of bone metastases compared to placebo/no bisphosphonate (RR 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75 to 0.99; P = 0.03, 11 studies; 15,005 women; moderate-quality evidence with no significant heterogeneity). Bisphosphonates provided an overall survival benefit with time-to-event data (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.99; P = 0.04; 9 studies; 13,949 women; high-quality evidence with evidence of heterogeneity). Subgroup analysis by menopausal status showed a survival benefit from bisphosphonates in postmenopausal women (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.90; P = 0.001; 4 studies; 6048 women; high-quality evidence with no evidence of heterogeneity) but no survival benefit for premenopausal women (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.22; P = 0.78; 2 studies; 3501 women; high-quality evidence with no heterogeneity). There was evidence of no effect of bisphosphonates on disease-free survival (HR 0.94, 95% 0.87 to 1.02; P = 0.13; 7 studies; 12,578 women; high-quality evidence with significant heterogeneity present) however subgroup analyses showed a disease-free survival benefit from bisphosphonates in postmenopausal women only (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.91; P < 0.001; 7 studies; 8314 women; high-quality evidence with no heterogeneity). Bisphosphonates did not significantly reduce the incidence of fractures when compared to placebo/no bisphosphonates (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.08, P = 0.13, 6 studies, 7602 women; moderate-quality evidence due to wide confidence intervals). We await mature overall survival and disease-free survival results for denosumab trials. In women with ABC without clinically evident bone metastases, there was no evidence of an effect of bisphosphonates on bone metastases (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.43; P = 0.86; 3 studies; 330 women; moderate-quality evidence with no heterogeneity) or overall survival (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.09; P = 0.28; 3 studies; 330 women; high-quality evidence with no heterogeneity) compared to placebo/no bisphosphonates however the confidence intervals were wide. One study reported a trend towards an extended period of time without a SRE with bisphosphonate compared to placebo (low-quality evidence). One study reported quality of life and there was no apparent difference in scores between bisphosphonate and placebo (moderate-quality evidence). In women with BCBM, bisphosphonates reduced the SRE risk by 14% (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.95; P = 0.003; 9 studies; 2810 women; high-quality evidence with evidence of heterogeneity) compared with placebo/no bisphosphonates. This benefit persisted when administering either intravenous or oral bisphosphonates versus placebo. Bisphosphonates delayed the median time to a SRE with a median ratio of 1.43 (95% CI 1.29 to 1.58; P < 0.00001; 9 studies; 2891 women; high-quality evidence with no heterogeneity) and reduced bone pain (in 6 out of 11 studies; moderate-quality evidence) compared to placebo/no bisphosphonate. Treatment with bisphosphonates did not appear to affect overall survival (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.11; P = 0.85; 7 studies; 1935 women; moderate-quality evidence with significant heterogeneity). Quality-of-life scores were slightly better with bisphosphonates than placebo at comparable time points (in three out of five studies; moderate-quality evidence) however scores decreased during the course of the studies. Denosumab reduced the risk of developing a SRE compared with bisphosphonates by 22% (RR 0.78, 0.72 to 0.85; P < 0.001; 3 studies, 2345 women). One study reported data on overall survival and observed no difference in survival between denosumab and bisphosphonate. Reported toxicities across all settings were generally mild. Osteonecrosis of the jaw was rare, occurring less than 0.5% in the adjuvant setting (high-quality evidence).
For women with EBC, bisphosphonates reduce the risk of bone metastases and provide an overall survival benefit compared to placebo or no bisphosphonates. There is preliminary evidence suggestive that bisphosphonates provide an overall survival and disease-free survival benefit in postmenopausal women only when compared to placebo or no bisphosphonate. This was not a planned subgroup for these early trials, and we await the completion of new large clinical trials assessing benefit for postmenopausal women. For women with BCBM, bisphosphonates reduce the risk of developing SREs, delay the median time to an SRE, and appear to reduce bone pain compared to placebo or no bisphosphonate.","Breast cancer may spread and recur in the bones. This may cause fractures, pain and high calcium in the bloodstream (known as complications).
Medicines for osteoporosis may prevent these complications and may help cure cancer by reducing cancer growth in the bone. These medicines are called 'bisphosphonates'. A newer type is called  denosumab. Bisphosphonates or denosumab are given in addition to other cancer treatment medications. These may be given along with chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, or radiotherapy.
The goal of bisphosphonates and denosumab differs based on the women's breast cancer status.
We asked three main questions:
1. For women with early breast cancer (EBC) , can bisphosphonates or denosumab reduce the risk of the cancer spreading to the bone? Will adding this medicine to anticancer treatments allow women to live longer (improve survival)?
2. For women with advanced breast cancer which does not appear to involve the bone (ABC) , can bisphosphonates reduce the risk of the cancer spreading to the bone and improve survival? Will bisphosphonates reduce complications and improve quality of life?
3. For women with metastatic breast cancer that has spread to the bone (BCBM), can bisphosphonates or denosumab reduce the risk of complication, and improve quality of life and survival?
We found 44 studies involving 37,302 participants. We included studies published by September 2016.
For women with EBC, we included 17 studies with 26,129 participants. The women's health was monitored for at least 12 months from the start of the study. Some studies monitored women for 10 years.
The studies tested different types of bisphosphonate drugs and denosumab, and different doses of these drugs. Some studies compared the drugs to no treatment. Some studies used oral medications. Other studies gave the medicine as an injection into a vein or under the skin.
Bisphosphonates probably lowered the risk of cancer spreading to the bone.
Bisphosphonates were found to improve survival, but the benefit in the whole group of women was small. Postmenopausal women had a benefit from bisphosphonates with improved survival and reduced risk of cancer returning. Premenopausal women did not have improved survival or reduced risk of the cancer returning. New studies that test bisphosphonates by the women's menopausal status are awaited.
We await the reporting of data on survival and other important outcomes from denosumab trials.
For women with ABC that had not spread to the bone, we included three studies enrolling 330 participants. All three studies compared oral bisphosphonates to no treatment.
Bisphosphonates did not reduce the risk of cancer spreading to the bone or improve survival. Very little information was available on complications and quality of life from only one study.
For women with BCBM, we included 24 studies enrolling 10,853 participants. Their health was monitored for at least 12 months. Some women were followed for 24 months. Most studies compared bisphosphonates to receiving no medication.
Bisphosphonates reduced complications (fractures and bone pain). Bisphosphonates did not appear to increase the length of time women survived. Quality of life scores were slightly better for women receiving bisphosphonates compared to similar women having no bisphosphonates.
Denosumab reduced the risk of complications compared to bisphosphonates in the three studies that collected these data. There was no benefit in survival from denosumab in the one study that collected data.
Side effects were uncommon and mild. There was a rare risk of damage to the jaw bone (osteonecrosis of the jaw).
Overall, most of the evidence was moderate to high-quality.

60e769ec9858960e8ad00886,static_2,Psychosocial interventions for the prevention of disability following traumatic physical injury,"Traumatic physical injury can result in many disabling sequelae including physical and mental health problems and impaired social functioning.
To assess the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions in the prevention of physical, mental and social disability following traumatic physical injury.
The search was not restricted by date, language or publication status. We searched the following electronic databases; Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 1), MEDLINE (Ovid SP), EMBASE (Ovid SP), PsycINFO (Ovid SP), Controlled Trials metaRegister (www.controlled-trials.com), AMED (Allied & Complementary Medicine), ISI Web of Science: Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI), PubMed. We also screened the reference lists of all selected papers and contacted authors of relevant studies. The latest search for trials was in February 2008.
Randomised controlled trials that consider one or more defined psychosocial interventions for the prevention of physical disability, mental health problems or reduced social functioning as a result of traumatic physical injury. We excluded studies that included patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Two authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of search results, reviewed the full text of potentially relevant studies, independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. We included five studies, involving 756 participants. Three studies assessed the effect of brief psychological therapies, one assessed the impact of a self-help booklet, and one the effect of collaborative care. The disparate nature of the trials covering different patient populations, interventions and outcomes meant that it was not possible to pool data meaningfully across studies. There was no evidence of a protective effect of brief psychological therapy or educational booklets on preventing disability. There was evidence from one trial of a reduction in both post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depressive symptoms one month after injury in those who received a collaborative care intervention combined with a brief psycho-educational intervention, however this was not retained at follow up. Overall mental health status was the only disability outcome affected by any intervention. In three trials the psychosocial intervention had a detrimental effect on the mental health status of patients. This review provides no convincing evidence of the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for the prevention of disability following traumatic physical injury. Taken together, our findings cannot be considered as supporting the provision of psychosocial interventions to prevent aspects of disability arising from physical injury. However, these conclusions are based on a small number of disparate trials with small to moderate sample sizes and are therefore necessarily cautious. More research, using larger sample sizes, and similar interventions and patient populations to enable pooling of results, is needed before these findings can be confirmed.","Traumatic physical injury such as that resulting from road traffic accidents, falls and fires can cause high levels of subsequent disability in the person affected. This may include physical disability as a result of the initial injury and subsequent complications, mental health problems such as depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a result of the trauma of the event which caused the injury and the resulting physical and social problems, and social problems such as loss of social life and unemployment. It is therefore important to evaluate interventions which seek to prevent these adverse secondary outcomes. Psychosocial interventions, which include psychological therapies such as interpersonal counselling and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), and social interventions such as befriending, social support and self-help advice, delivered soon after the injury, may help to prevent these problems.
This review identified five randomised controlled trials, involving 756 participants, which evaluated psychosocial interventions for the prevention of disability following traumatic injury. No convincing evidence was found supporting the efficacy of these interventions. In particular, self-help booklets and interpersonal therapies had no effect on preventing disability. There was some evidence that a more complex intervention involving collaborative care reduced symptoms of depression and PTSD in the short but not the medium term. There was evidence from three trials that psychosocial interventions had a detrimental effect on mental health. Taken together, our findings cannot be taken as supporting the provision of psychosocial interventions to prevent aspects of disability arising from physical injury. These results suggest that future interventions should focus on screening patients at risk of poor outcomes and only treating those who develop subsequent problems. However, the strength of these conclusions is limited by the small size and varied nature of many of the trials, which means that their results cannot be pooled.",1060,psychosocial interventions; traumatic physical injury; disabling sequelae; physical disability; mental health problems; social functioning; collaborative care; post-traumatic stress disorder; depressive symptoms; psycho-educational intervention,What types of disabilities can traumatic physical injury cause?,Identify the primary purpose of evaluating psychosocial interventions in the context of traumatic injuries.,Select all of the following that are colors,Which psychosocial intervention showed short-term efficacy in reducing depressive symptoms?,Explain the overall finding regarding the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions after a traumatic injury.,Physical and mental health problems; Improved social interactions; Increased employment opportunities,Physical and mental health problems,To prevent adverse secondary outcomes; To reduce the cost of medical treatments; To enhance physical strength,To prevent adverse secondary outcomes,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Collaborative care intervention; Self-help booklet; Interpersonal therapy,Collaborative care intervention,No convincing evidence supports their efficacy; Effective in preventing all types of disability; Significantly improved physical recovery,No convincing evidence supports their efficacy
60e769ec9858960e8ad00886,static_2,Lipid-lowering agents for nephrotic syndrome,"Nephrotic syndrome is the collective name given to a group of symptoms that include proteinuria, lipiduria, hypoalbuminaemia, oedema, hypercholesterolaemia, elevated triglycerides, and hyperlipidaemia. Hyperlipidaemia is thought to aggravate glomerulosclerosis (hardening of blood vessels in the kidneys) and enhance progression of glomerular disease. Studies have established that reduction in total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is associated with reduction in risk of cardiovascular diseases. In 2011, the European Society of Cardiology and European Atherosclerosis Society guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemia recommended use of statins as first-line agents in the management of nephrotic dyslipidaemia. However, the effectiveness and safety of statins for people with nephrotic syndrome remains uncertain. Furthermore, the efficacy of second-line lipid-lowering drugs, such as ezetimibe and nicotinic acid, has not been proven in patients with nephrotic syndrome who are unable to tolerate statin therapy. This review aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of lipid-lowering agents in adults and children with nephrotic syndrome. We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register (to 18 March 2013) through contact with the Trials Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review. All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs (RCTs in which allocation to treatment was obtained by alternation, use of alternate medical records, date of birth or other predictable methods) looking at participants with nephrotic syndrome that compared any lipid-lowering agent to placebo, no treatment or other lipid-lowering agents, given for not less than four weeks, were included. Two authors independently assessed study eligibility and risk of bias, and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using a random effects model. Dichotomous results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). For continuous measures mean difference (MD) was used, or the standardised mean difference (SMD) where different scales had been used. We included five RCTs enrolling a total of 203 participants. Of these, four studies compared statins with no treatment or placebo, and one compared fibrates with placebo. We found no published studies comparing second-line agents such as ezetimibe, bile acid sequestrants, and nicotinic acid with placebo or no treatment. Our assessment of the risk of bias found that one study was judged overall to be at low risk of bias and the remaining four were judged to be at high risk of bias. Most outcomes were supported by single study data. One study reported significantly increased high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol among participants in the statin arm compared with the no treatment group (MD 5.40 mg/dL, 95% CI 2.31 to 8.49). Another study reported higher serum albumin in the statin group compared to those who received no treatment (MD 0.60 g/dL, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.06). No serious adverse events, such as rhabdomyolysis, were reported, however some minor events occurred. One study reported no significant difference in the number of participants with elevated liver enzymes (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.13 to 69.52); three studies reported liver enzymes remained within the normal range (no data provided). Four studies reported creatinine phosphokinase (CPK). One study indicated that CPK values fluctuated in both the simvastatin and placebo groups (no data provided); the remaining three studies reported CPK either stayed within the normal range (one study) or there was no significant difference between the lipid lowering agents and placebo. None of the included studies reported patient-centred outcomes including all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, or non-fatal myocardial infarction; only single studies reported cholesterol (HDL, LDL and total cholesterol), triglycerides, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, liver enzymes, and protein (serum, urine). High quality RCTs need to be conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of lipid-lowering drugs for people with nephrotic syndrome.","Nephrotic syndrome is a relatively rare condition in which the kidneys leak protein into the urine, leading to early signs such as swelling of the feet and face, along with low levels of protein in the blood and high levels of fats, particularly cholesterol and triglycerides. Management often includes therapies to reduce blood lipids, and several types of lipid-lowering drugs such as statins, bile acid sequestrants, nicotinic acid, and ezetimibe can be used. We searched for evidence from randomized controlled trials to determine whether lipid-lowering medications are beneficial for people with nephrotic syndrome. We found five small studies involving 203 participants that examined four different lipid-lowering agents: simvastatin, lovastatin, fluvastatin, and gemfibrozil.

60e769ec9858960e8ad00886,interactive_3,Stem cell treatment for chronic ischaemic heart disease and congestive heart failure,"A promising approach to the treatment of chronic ischaemic heart disease and congestive heart failure is the use of stem cells. The last decade has seen a plethora of randomised controlled trials developed worldwide, which have generated conflicting results.
The critical evaluation of clinical evidence on the safety and efficacy of autologous adult bone marrow-derived stem/progenitor cells as a treatment for chronic ischaemic heart disease and congestive heart failure.
We searched CENTRAL in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, and four ongoing trial databases for relevant trials up to 14 December 2015.
Eligible studies were randomised controlled trials comparing autologous adult stem/progenitor cells with no cells in people with chronic ischaemic heart disease and congestive heart failure. We included co-interventions, such as primary angioplasty, surgery, or administration of stem cell mobilising agents, when administered to treatment and control arms equally.
Two review authors independently screened all references for eligibility, assessed trial quality, and extracted data. We undertook a quantitative evaluation of data using random-effects meta-analyses. We evaluated heterogeneity using the I2statistic and explored substantial heterogeneity (I2 greater than 50%) through subgroup analyses. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We created a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADEprofiler (GRADEpro), excluding studies with a high or unclear risk of selection bias. We focused our summary of findings on long-term follow-up of mortality, morbidity outcomes, and left ventricular ejection fraction measured by magnetic resonance imaging.
We included 38 randomised controlled trials involving 1907 participants (1114 cell therapy, 793 controls) in this review update. Twenty-three trials were at high or unclear risk of selection bias. Other sources of potential bias included lack of blinding of participants (12 trials) and full or partial commercial sponsorship (13 trials). Cell therapy reduced the incidence of long-term mortality (? 12 months) (risk ratio (RR) 0.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.21 to 0.87; participants = 491; studies = 9; I2= 0%; low-quality evidence). Periprocedural adverse events associated with the mapping or cell/placebo injection procedure were infrequent. Cell therapy was also associated with a long-term reduction in the incidence of non-fatal myocardial infarction (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.97; participants = 345; studies = 5; I2= 0%; low-quality evidence) and incidence of arrhythmias (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.99; participants = 82; studies = 1; low-quality evidence). However, we found no evidence that cell therapy affects the risk of rehospitalisation for heart failure (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.09; participants = 375; studies = 6; I2= 0%; low-quality evidence) or composite incidence of mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and/or rehospitalisation for heart failure (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.08; participants = 141; studies = 3; I2= 0%; low-quality evidence), or long-term left ventricular ejection fraction when measured by magnetic resonance imaging (mean difference -1.60, 95% CI -8.70 to 5.50; participants = 25; studies = 1; low-quality evidence).
This systematic review and meta-analysis found low-quality evidence that treatment with bone marrow-derived stem/progenitor cells reduces mortality and improves left ventricular ejection fraction over short- and long-term follow-up and may reduce the incidence of non-fatal myocardial infarction and improve New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Classification in people with chronic ischaemic heart disease and congestive heart failure. These findings should be interpreted with caution, as event rates were generally low, leading to a lack of precision.","Are adult stem/progenitor cells derived from bone marrow safe and effective as a treatment for chronic ischaemic heart disease and heart failure?
The current treatment for people suffering from heart disease and heart failure is drugs and, when possible, restoration of the blood supply in the heart (revascularisation) either by opening the arteries with a tiny balloon in a procedure called primary angioplasty (or percutaneous coronary intervention) or by heart surgery (or coronary artery bypass graft). Revascularisation has reduced the death rate associated with these conditions. In some people, heart disease and heart failure symptoms persist even after revascularisation. Recently, bone marrow stem/progenitor cells have been investigated as a new treatment for people with heart disease and heart failure, whether or not they also undergo revascularisation.
We searched electronic databases for relevant randomised controlled trials to December 2015.
We included 38 randomised controlled trials involving more than 1900 participants in this review, with 14 trials of chronic ischaemic heart disease, 17 trials of ischaemic heart failure secondary to heart disease, and seven trials of refractory or intractable angina. The mean age of participants ranged from 55 to 70 years, and the proportion of male participants ranged from 51% to 100%.
The quality of the evidence was low, as the number of included studies and participants is not currently high enough to draw robust conclusions.

60e769ec9858960e8ad00886,interactive_4,Statins for the prevention of dementia,"This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2001 and then updated in 2009. Vascular risk factors including high cholesterol levels increase the risk of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease and of vascular dementia. Some observational studies have suggested an association between statin use and lowered incidence of dementia.
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of statins for the prevention of dementia in people at risk of dementia due to their age and to determine whether the efficacy and safety of statins for this purpose depends on cholesterol level, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype or cognitive level.
We searched ALOIS (the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group), The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) Portal on 11 November 2015. We included double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials in which statins were administered for at least 12 months to people at risk of dementia. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We included two trials with 26,340 participants aged 40 to 82 years of whom 11,610 were aged 70 or older. All participants had a history of, or risk factors for, vascular disease. The studies used different statins (simvastatin and pravastatin). Mean follow-up was 3.2 years in one study and five years in one study. The risk of bias was low. Only one study reported on the incidence of dementia (20,536 participants, 31 cases in each group; odds ratio (OR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61 to 1.65, moderate quality evidence, downgraded due to imprecision). Both studies assessed cognitive function, but at different times using different scales, so we judged the results unsuitable for a meta-analysis. There were no differences between statin and placebo groups on five different cognitive tests (high quality evidence). Rates of treatment discontinuation due to non-fatal adverse events were less than 5% in both studies and there was no difference between statin and placebo groups in the risk of withdrawal due to adverse events (26,340 participants, 2 studies, OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.05). There is good evidence that statins given in late life to people at risk of vascular disease do not prevent cognitive decline or dementia. Biologically, it seems feasible that statins could prevent dementia due to their role in cholesterol reduction and initial evidence from observational studies was very promising. However, indication bias may have been a factor in these studies and the evidence from subsequent RCTs has been negative. There were limitations in the included studies involving the cognitive assessments used and the inclusion of participants at moderate to high vascular risk only.","Dementia (including Alzheimer's disease) is a global healthcare concern; the number of people affected worldwide is predicted to double every 20 years, reaching 74.7 million in 2010 and 131.5 million in 2050. Therefore, it is important to find means of preventing dementia. It has been suggested that high levels of cholesterol in the serum (part of the blood) may increase the risk of dementia and that treatment with cholesterol-lowering medicines such as statins may reduce the risk of dementia. We searched medical databases for clinical trials comparing giving a statin to giving a placebo (pretend medicine) to people with normal cognitive function (which is brain activities that allow us to gain and use knowledge) and of sufficient age to be at risk of Alzheimer's disease. There were limitations in the included studies involving the methods of assessment of cognition and the inclusion only of participants deemed to be of moderate to high risk of a problem with their blood (vascular) system. Nevertheless, there was good evidence that statins given in late life to people at risk of vascular disease do not prevent cognitive decline or dementia.",1131,dementia; statins; Alzheimer's disease; vascular dementia; apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype; cognitive decline; vascular risk factors; cholesterol reduction; adverse events; incidence of dementia,What key limitations in the studies may have impacted the conclusions about statins and dementia prevention?,Why might the biological mechanism of statins suggest potential for dementia prevention?,Select all of the following that are colors,Summarize the conclusion about the effect of statins on cognitive decline.,Explain the proposed relationship between cholesterol levels and dementia risk.,The methods of cognition assessment used; The exclusion of participants with low vascular risk; The lack of placebo control,The methods of cognition assessment used; The exclusion of participants with low vascular risk,Statins are known for their cholesterol-reducing role; Statins enhance cognitive function directly; Statins alter brain structure to prevent decline,Statins are known for their cholesterol-reducing role,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Statins do not prevent cognitive decline; Statins significantly increase cognitive function; Statins have an unpredictable effect on cognition,Statins do not prevent cognitive decline,High cholesterol may increase dementia risk; Low cholesterol directly causes dementia; Cholesterol has no link to dementia risk,High cholesterol may increase dementia risk
60e769ec9858960e8ad00886,interactive_4,"What are the benefits and harms of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs), the next-generation blood thinners, after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR)?","Balancing the risk of thromboembolism and bleeding after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) remains clinically challenging. Questions regarding the efficacy and safety of  non?vitamin  K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) after TAVR still need to be definitively answered.
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of NOACs after TAVR in individuals with and without indication for anticoagulation.
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP on 7 October 2023 together with reference checking and citation searching to identify additional studies.
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared NOACs versus antiplatelet therapy or vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) after TAVR in adults with or without an indication for anticoagulation.
We used standard Cochrane methods and conducted random-effects pair-wise analyses and network meta-analyses (NMAs). Our primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, stroke, and major bleeding. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence.
We included four RCTs with 4808 participants in the NMA. Of these, one compared rivaroxaban versus antiplatelet therapy in people without an indication for anticoagulation after TAVR; one compared apixaban versus antiplatelet therapy in people without an indication for anticoagulation or versus VKA in people with an indication for anticoagulation after TAVR; one compared edoxaban versus VKA in people with an indication for anticoagulation after TAVR; and one compared edoxaban with antiplatelet therapy in people without an indication for anticoagulation after TAVR. The mean age of trial participants was 81 years. Follow-up duration ranged from 6 to 18 months. Overall, we judged the risk of bias in the included trials to be low in all domains except for blinding, which was assessed as high in all four studies. No studies evaluated dabigatran. In peoplewithoutan indication for anticoagulation, rivaroxaban and apixaban may increase all-cause mortality after TAVR as compared to antiplatelet therapy (rivaroxaban: risk ratio (RR) 1.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13 to 2.46; studies = 1, participants = 1644; moderate-certainty evidence; apixaban: RR 1.71, 95% CI 0.97 to 3.02; studies = 1, participants = 1049; low-certainty evidence), while edoxaban may result in little or no difference (RR 1.59, 95% CI 0.27 to 9.36; studies = 1, participants = 229; low-certainty evidence). Low-certainty evidence suggests little or no difference between rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban and antiplatelet therapy in cardiovascular mortality (rivaroxaban: RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.10; studies = 1, participants = 1644; apixaban: RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.64 to 2.65; studies = 1, participants = 1049; edoxaban: RR 7.44, 95% CI 0.39 to 142.38; studies = 1, participants = 229) and between rivaroxaban or edoxaban and antiplatelets in stroke (rivaroxaban: RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.71 to 2.00; studies = 1, participants = 1644; edoxaban: RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.15 to 7.42; studies = 1, participants = 229). While rivaroxaban versus antiplatelets probably increases major bleeding after TAVR (RR 1.98, 95% CI 1.07 to 3.65; studies = 1, participants = 1644; moderate-certainty evidence), there may be little or no difference between apixaban and antiplatelet therapy (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.64; studies = 1, participants = 1049; low-certainty evidence). It is unclear if edoxaban has an effect on major bleeding, although the point estimate suggests increased bleeding (versus antiplatelets: RR 2.13, 95% CI 0.54 to 8.30; studies = 1, participants = 229; low-certainty evidence). In peoplewithan indication for anticoagulation, low-certainty evidence suggests apixaban or edoxaban may result in little to no difference in our predefined primary efficacy outcomes after TAVR when compared to VKA (all-cause mortality: apixaban: RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.77; studies = 1, participants = 451; edoxaban: RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.20; studies = 1, participants = 1426; cardiovascular mortality: apixaban: RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.76 to 2.70; studies = 1, participants = 451; edoxaban: RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.57; studies = 1, participants = 1426; stroke: apixaban: RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.35 to 4.70; studies = 1, participants = 451; edoxaban: RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.34; studies = 1, participants = 1426). While apixaban may result in a similar rate of bleeding as VKA in this population, edoxaban probably increases major bleeding after TAVR in people with an indication for anticoagulation (apixaban: RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.54; studies = 1, participants = 451; low-certainty evidence; edoxaban: RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.93; studies = 1, participants = 1426; moderate-certainty evidence).
In peoplewithoutan indication for oral anticoagulation, rivaroxaban and apixaban may increase all-cause mortality when compared to antiplatelet therapy, while edoxaban may result in little or no difference. There might be little or no difference between rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban and antiplatelet therapy in cardiovascular mortality, and between rivaroxaban or edoxaban and antiplatelets in stroke. While rivaroxaban probably increases major bleeding following TAVR, there might be little or no difference between apixaban and antiplatelet therapy, and the effect of edoxaban on major bleeding remains unclear. In peoplewithan indication for anticoagulation, apixaban and edoxaban may be as effective as VKA in preventing all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death, and stroke. Apixaban may lead to a similar rate of major bleeding as VKA in this population. However, edoxaban probably increases major bleeding following TAVR when compared to VKA. Our NMA did not show superiority of one NOAC over another for any of the primary outcomes. Head-to-head trials directly comparing NOACs against each other are required to increase the certainty of the evidence.","TAVR is a heart valve replacement procedure that does not require open-heart surgery. It uses a heart catheter to insert a new valve through a small surgical incision in the leg or chest. Choosing the best treatment for people after TAVR remains a challenge in clinical practice.
We looked at whether the next-generation blood thinners, non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs), are safer and more effective than antiplatelet drugs or vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), such as warfarin, after TAVR.
We searched for studies that looked at the benefits and harms of NOACs compared with antiplatelet therapy or VKA after TAVR.
We found five studies that compared three types of NOACs: rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, with antiplatelet drugs or warfarin, one of which is ongoing. Our review findings are based on the four completed studies involving 4808 participants.
We found that in people who did not have a medical reason to take blood thinners, the NOACs rivaroxaban and apixaban may increase the risk of death for any reason compared to antiplatelet therapy, while edoxaban appears to have little or no effect. Any differences between rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban, and antiplatelet therapy in death caused by diseases of the heart or blood vessels are likely small. Similarly, differences between rivaroxaban or edoxaban and antiplatelets in stroke are also likely small. In these people, the risk of serious bleeding is probably increased with rivaroxaban; however, there seems to be little or no difference between apixaban and antiplatelet therapy, and we are uncertain about the impact of edoxaban on serious bleeding.
In people who have a medical reason to take blood thinners, we found that apixaban and edoxaban may be as effective as warfarin in preventing death for any reason, death caused by diseases of the heart or blood vessels, and stroke. Apixaban may result in a similar rate of serious bleeding as warfarin, whereas edoxaban probably increases the rate of serious bleeding compared to warfarin.
We are uncertain if any one type of NOAC is better than another. More research is needed to know for sure.
We have little confidence in the evidence for apixaban and edoxaban because the included studies were small. We are only moderately confident in some of the evidence for rivaroxaban, also due to the small size of studies.

60e769ec9858960e8ad00886,finetuned_5,"Thymic peptides for treatment of cancer patients in addition to chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or both","Purified thymus extracts (pTE) and synthetic thymic peptides (sTP) are thought to enhance the immune system of cancer patients to help fight tumour growth and reduce infections caused by disease-related or treatment-related immunosuppression. This review evaluated the effectiveness of pTE and sTP for cancer management. Researchers searched major medical databases up to February 2010 for randomized trials in adult cancer patients where pTE or sTP were added to chemotherapy or radiotherapy and compared with the same regimen alone or with placebo. Data were independently extracted by two authors, and odds ratios were calculated for overall survival, disease-free survival, tumour response, and adverse effects. A random-effects model was used. Twenty-six trials involving 2736 patients were identified: 20 trials investigated pTE (thymostimulin or thymosin fraction 5) and six investigated sTP (thymopentin or thymosin ?1). Twenty-one trials reported overall survival, six reported disease-free survival, 14 reported tumour response, nine reported adverse effects, and 10 reported safety. Adding pTE showed no benefit for overall survival (RR 1.00), disease-free survival (RR 0.97), or tumour response (RR 1.07), with moderate to high heterogeneity. For thymosin ?1, the pooled RR for overall survival was 1.21 and for disease-free survival was 3.37, though neither result reached statistical significance. pTE reduced the risk of severe infectious complications (RR 0.54), and thymostimulin showed a non-significant trend toward reduced severe neutropenia. Both pTE and sTP were generally well tolerated. Many trials had at least moderate risk of bias. Overall, there is no clear evidence that adding pTE to cancer treatment improves survival or tumour response, although thymosin ?1 showed a possible trend toward benefit. There is preliminary evidence that pTE may reduce severe infectious complications during chemotherapy or radiotherapy.","The immune system plays a key role in the body's own defences against cancer cells. The thymus gland plays a central part in this and modifies T-cells, a subset of lymphocytes. Studies with thymic peptides have shown a variety of effects on the immune system. There are two groups of thymic peptides available for use in treatment: purified extracts from animal (mostly calf) thymus glands and synthetically produced thymus gland peptides.
This review aims to answer the question whether having thymic peptides can improve the response to and tolerability of standard chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or combined treatment. Further questions are whether the peptides inhibit or reduce the progression and recurrence of disease, whether they prolong the life of cancer patients and whether quality of life is improved. This review looked at the evidence from 26 clinical trials with a total of 2736 adult cancer patients. Many of the trials were small and of moderate quality. Only three studies were less than 10 years old. Thymosin ?1 is a synthetic peptide that shows some promise as a treatment option for patients with metastatic melanoma when used in addition to chemotherapy. Severe problems occur during chemotherapy and radiotherapy due to low white blood cell counts and infections. These were reduced by using purified thymus extracts.

60e769ec9858960e8ad00886,finetuned_6,Quality improvement strategies for diabetes care: Effects on outcomes for adults living with diabetes,"There is a large body of evidence evaluating quality improvement (QI) programmes to improve care for adults living with diabetes. These programmes are often comprised of multiple QI strategies, which may be implemented in various combinations. Decision-makers planning to implement or evaluate a new QI programme, or both, need reliable evidence on the relative effectiveness of different QI strategies (individually and in combination) for different patient populations. To update existing systematic reviews of diabetes QI programmes and apply novel meta-analytical techniques to estimate the effectiveness of QI strategies (individually and in combination) on diabetes quality of care. We searched databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL) and trials registers (ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP) to 4 June 2019. We conducted a top-up search to 23 September 2021; we screened these search results and 42 studies meeting our eligibility criteria are available in the awaiting classification section. We included randomised trials that assessed a QI programme to improve care in outpatient settings for people living with diabetes. QI programmes needed to evaluate at least one system- or provider-targeted QI strategy alone or in combination with a patient-targeted strategy. - System-targeted: case management (CM); team changes (TC); electronic patient registry (EPR); facilitated relay of clinical information (FR); continuous quality improvement (CQI). - Provider-targeted: audit and feedback (AF); clinician education (CE); clinician reminders (CR); financial incentives (FI). - Patient-targeted: patient education (PE); promotion of self-management (PSM); patient reminders (PR). Patient-targeted QI strategies needed to occur with a minimum of one provider or system-targeted strategy. We dual-screened search results and abstracted data on study design, study population and QI strategies. We assessed the impact of the programmes on 13 measures of diabetes care, including: glycaemic control (e.g. mean glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c)); cardiovascular risk factor management (e.g. mean systolic blood pressure (SBP), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), proportion of people living with diabetes that quit smoking or receiving cardiovascular medications); and screening/prevention of microvascular complications (e.g. proportion of patients receiving retinopathy or foot screening); and harms (e.g. proportion of patients experiencing adverse hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia). We modelled the association of each QI strategy with outcomes using a series of hierarchical multivariable meta-regression models in a Bayesian framework. The previous version of this review identified that different strategies were more or less effective depending on baseline levels of outcomes. To explore this further, we extended the main additive model for continuous outcomes (HbA1c, SBP and LDL-C) to include an interaction term between each strategy and average baseline risk for each study (baseline thresholds were based on a data-driven approach; we used the median of all baseline values reported in the trials). Based on model diagnostics, the baseline interaction models for HbA1c, SBP and LDL-C performed better than the main model and are therefore presented as the primary analyses for these outcomes. Based on the model results, we qualitatively ordered each QI strategy within three tiers (Top, Middle, Bottom) based on its magnitude of effect relative to the other QI strategies, where 'Top' indicates that the QI strategy was likely one of the most effective strategies for that specific outcome. Secondary analyses explored the sensitivity of results to choices in model specification and priors. Additional information about the methods and results of the review are available as Appendices in an online repository. This review will be maintained as a living systematic review; we will update our syntheses as more data become available. We identified 553 trials (428 patient-randomised and 125 cluster-randomised trials), including a total of 412,161 participants. Of the included studies, 66% involved people living with type 2 diabetes only. Participants were 50% female and the median age of participants was 58.4 years. The mean duration of follow-up was 12.5 months. HbA1c was the commonest reported outcome; screening outcomes and outcomes related to cardiovascular medications, smoking and harms were reported infrequently. The most frequently evaluated QI strategies across all study arms were PE, PSM and CM, while the least frequently evaluated QI strategies included AF, FI and CQI. Our confidence in the evidence is limited due to a lack of information on how studies were conducted. Four QI strategies (CM, TC, PE, PSM) were consistently identified as 'Top' across the majority of outcomes. All QI strategies were ranked as 'Top' for at least one key outcome. The majority of effects of individual QI strategies were modest, but when used in combination could result in meaningful population-level improvements across the majority of outcomes. The median number of QI strategies in multicomponent QI programmes was three. Combinations of the three most effective QI strategies were estimated to lead to the below effects: - PR + PSM + CE: decrease in HbA1c by 0.41% (credibility interval (CrI) -0.61 to -0.22) when baseline HbA1c < 8.3%; - CM + PE + EPR: decrease in HbA1c by 0.62% (CrI -0.84 to -0.39) when baseline HbA1c > 8.3%; - PE + TC + PSM: reduction in SBP by 2.14 mmHg (CrI -3.80 to -0.52) when baseline SBP < 136 mmHg; - CM + TC + PSM: reduction in SBP by 4.39 mmHg (CrI -6.20 to -2.56) when baseline SBP > 136 mmHg; - TC + PE + CM: LDL-C lowering of 5.73 mg/dL (CrI -7.93 to -3.61) when baseline LDL < 107 mg/dL; - TC + CM + CR: LDL-C lowering by 5.52 mg/dL (CrI -9.24 to -1.89) when baseline LDL > 107 mg/dL. Assuming a baseline screening rate of 50%, the three most effective QI strategies were estimated to lead to an absolute improvement of 33% in retinopathy screening (PE + PR + TC) and 38% absolute increase in foot screening (PE + TC + Other). There is a significant body of evidence about QI programmes to improve the management of diabetes. Multicomponent QI programmes for diabetes care (comprised of effective QI strategies) may achieve meaningful population-level improvements across the majority of outcomes. For health system decision-makers, the evidence summarised in this review can be used to identify strategies to include in QI programmes. For researchers, this synthesis identifies higher-priority QI strategies to examine in further research regarding how to optimise their evaluation and effects. We will maintain this as a living systematic review.","Diabetes, a disorder of how sugar is managed by the body, can lead to complications such as heart disease and blindness. If people with diabetes get the best possible treatment, their risk for these and other diabetes-related complications will be lowered. Unfortunately, many people with diabetes do not get the best possible treatment.
Quality improvement programmes using different strategies help healthcare professionals improve care. We examined 12 common types of quality improvement strategies.
- Four strategies were directed at healthcare professionals: audit and feedback, clinician education, clinician reminders and financial incentives.
- Three strategies were directed at people living with diabetes: patient education, patient reminders and promotion of self-management.
- Five strategies involved healthcare organisations: case management, team changes, electronic patient registry, facilitated relay of clinical information and continuous quality improvement.
We wanted to find out which strategies worked best to improve:
- blood sugar control (measured using a test called glycated haemoglobin or HbA1c);
- blood pressure;
- low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C).
Lower levels on these tests are associated with lower rates of complications such as heart attacks.
We also assessed whether quality improvement strategies improved rates of screening for eye damage (also known as retinopathy) and loss of sensation in the foot (also known as neuropathy). Routine screening for these issues in people living with diabetes is recommended to prevent blindness or amputation, respectively.
We searched for randomised trials including adults living with diabetes managed in outpatient settings, which evaluated at least one quality improvement strategy. Although we were interested in strategies directed at people living with diabetes, patient strategies needed to be tested in combination with strategies directed at healthcare organisations or professionals for the study to be included. We summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods, size and other considerations.
We found 553 studies that involved 412,161 people with diabetes up to the year 2019. Studies took place in countries around the world with most being conducted in the USA (231) and in medical settings.
Most studies (367) involved people with type 2 diabetes. Half of the study participants were female. The average age of participants was 57 years. Most studies lasted 12 months.
Studies usually used multiple quality improvement strategies together. Most commonly, studies featured three quality improvement strategies.
Overall, case management, team changes, patient education and promotion of self-management appeared to be the most effective quality improvement strategies for diabetes care.
When considering three-strategy combinations (the median number of quality improvement strategies in multicomponent interventions), the combination of clinician education, promotion of self-management and patient reminders may lead to the most improvement in blood sugar control in people who begin with lower HbA1c. Whereas the combination of case management, patient education and electronic patient registries may lead to the largest improvement in blood sugar control for people who begin with higher HbA1c.
For blood pressure, people who have lower systolic blood pressure may see the most improvement with the combination of patient education, team changes and promotion of self-management. People who have higher systolic blood pressure may improve the most with the combination of case management, team changes and promotion of self-management.
For cholesterol, we found that team changes, patient education and case management may lead to the most improvement in people who already have lower low-density lipoprotein levels. For those who have higher levels of low-density lipoprotein, team changes, case management and clinician reminders may lead to the largest improvement.
Patient education, patient reminders and team changes may lead to an increase in retinopathy screening rates. Patient education, team changes and audit and feedback, financial incentives and continuous quality improvement strategies combined may lead to an increase in foot screening rates.
Clinics can improve their diabetes care by engaging in quality improvement programmes (especially those including case management, team changes, patient education and patient self-management).
Many studies did not provide information on everything we were interested in. Most focused on blood sugar control and few studies reported screening rates.

60e769ec9858960e8ad00886,finetuned_6,Medicines to prevent breast cancer in women at above-average risk of developing breast cancer,"Breast cancer is the most frequently occurring malignancy and the second cause of death for cancer in women. Cancer prevention agents (CPAs) are a promising approach to reduce the burden of breast cancer. Currently, two main types of CPAs are available: selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs, such as tamoxifen and raloxifene) and aromatase inhibitors (AIs, such as exemestane and anastrozole).
To assess the efficacy and acceptability of single CPAs for the prevention of primary breast cancer, in unaffected women, at an above-average risk of developing breast cancer. Using a network meta-analysis, to rank single CPAs, based on their efficacy and acceptability (an endpoint that is defined as the inverse of CPA-related toxicity).
We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), and ClinicalTrials.gov on 17 August 2018. We handsearched reference lists to identify additional relevant studies.
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that enrolled women without a personal history of breast cancer but with an above-average risk of developing a tumor. Women had to be treated with a CPA and followed up to record the occurrence of breast cancer and adverse events.
Two review authors independently extracted data and conducted risk of bias assessments of the included studies, and assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. Outcome data included incidence of breast carcinoma (both invasive and in situ carcinoma) and adverse events (both overall and severe toxicity). We performed a conventional meta-analysis (for direct comparisons of a single CPA with placebo or a different CPA) and network meta-analysis (for indirect comparisons).
We included six studies enrolling 50,927 women randomized to receive one CPA (SERMs: tamoxifen or raloxifene, or AIs: exemestane or anastrozole) or placebo. Three studies compared tamoxifen and placebo, two studies compared AIs (exemestane or anastrozole) versus placebo, and one study compared tamoxifen versus raloxifene. The risk of bias was low for all RCTs. For the tamoxifen versus placebo comparison, tamoxifen likely resulted in a lower risk of developing breast cancer compared to placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 0.76; 3 studies, 22,832 women; moderate-certainty evidence). In terms of adverse events, tamoxifen likely increased the risk of severe toxicity compared to placebo (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.47; 2 studies, 20,361 women; moderate-certainty evidence). In particular, women randomized to receive tamoxifen experienced a higher incidence of both endometrial carcinoma (RR 2.26, 95% CI 1.52 to 3.38; high-certainty evidence) and thromboembolism (RR 2.10, 95% CI 1.14 to 3.89; high-certainty evidence) compared to women who received placebo. For the AIs versus placebo comparison, AIs (exemestane or anastrozole) reduced the risk of breast cancer by 53% (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.63; 2 studies, 8424 women; high-certainty evidence). In terms of adverse events, AIs increased the risk of severe toxicity by 18% (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.28; 2 studies, 8352 women; high-certainty evidence). These differences were sustained especially by endocrine (e.g. hot flashes), gastrointestinal (e.g. diarrhea), and musculoskeletal (e.g. arthralgia) adverse events, while there were no differences in endometrial cancer or thromboembolism rates between AIs and placebo. For the tamoxifen versus raloxifene comparison, raloxifene probably performed worse than tamoxifen in terms of breast cancer incidence reduction (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.43; 1 study, 19,490 women; moderate-certainty evidence), but its use was associated with lower toxicity rates (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.95; 1 study, 19,490 women; moderate-certainty evidence), particularly relating to incidence of endometrial cancer and thromboembolism. An indirect comparison of treatment effects allowed us to compare the SERMs and AIs in this review. In terms of efficacy, AIs (exemestane or anastrozole) may have reduced breast cancer incidence slightly compared to tamoxifen (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.98; 5 RCTs, 31,256 women); however, the certainty of evidence was low. A lack of model convergence did not allow us to analyze toxicity data.
For women with an above-average risk of developing breast cancer, CPAs can reduce the incidence of this disease. AIs appear to be more effective than SERMs (tamoxifen) in reducing the risk of developing breast cancer. AIs are not associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer and thromboembolic events. However, long-term data on toxicities from tamoxifen are available while the follow-up toxicity data on unaffected women taking AIs is relatively short. Additional data from direct comparisons are needed to fully address the issues of breast cancer prevention by risk-reducing medications, with special regards to acceptability (i.e. the benefit/harm ratio).","Breast cancer is the most frequent type of cancer and the second cause of death by cancer in women. Therefore, any strategy which can reduce its burden is eagerly awaited. Cancer prevention agents (CPAs) are medicines that might fulfil this need. Currently, two main types of CPAs are available to combat breast cancer: selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs, such as tamoxifen and raloxifene) and aromatase inhibitors (such as exemestane and anastrozole). Women without personal history of breast cancer, but with above-average risk of developing this disease (that is, with a lifetime risk greater than 17%) represent the usual target population for CPAs.
This Cochrane Review aimed to summarize the evidence on the efficacy and toxicity of CPAs for the prevention of primary breast cancer.
The review authors found six studies enrolling 50,927 women to receive one CPA or placebo (a pretend treatment, e.g. a sugar pill). Three studies involving 23,013 women compared tamoxifen and placebo, two studies involving 8424 women compared aromatase inhibitors (exemestane or anastrozole) and placebo, and one study involving 19,490 women that compared tamoxifen and raloxifene.
Based on the three studies that compared tamoxifen to placebo, tamoxifen probably reduced the risk of developing breast cancer by 32% compared to placebo. However, tamoxifen was associated with a 28% increased risk of severe side effects compared to placebo based on two studies involving 20,361 women. In particular, women taking tamoxifen experienced higher incidence of endometrial cancer and thromboembolism than women having no medicine.
For women who received either an aromatase inhibitor (exemestane or anastrozole) or placebo, aromatase inhibitors reduced the risk of breast cancer by 53% compared to placebo. Data from two studies involving 8352 women indicated that aromatase inhibitors increased the risk of severe side effects by 18% compared to placebo. These differences were sustained especially by endocrine (hormonal; e.g. hot flashes), gastrointestinal (e.g. diarrhea), and musculoskeletal (e.g. joint pain) side effects, whereas there were no differences in either endometrial cancer or thromboembolism rates.
For women who received either tamoxifen or raloxifene, raloxifene probably performed worse than tamoxifen in terms of breast cancer incidence reduction, but its use was associated with a 13% reduction of toxicity rates especially endometrial cancer and thromboembolism.
A specialized method named a 'network meta-analysis' allowed us to compare medications never directly compared to each other in a study. Based on this network meta-analysis, aromatase inhibitors may have led to a 23% additional risk reduction of developing breast cancer compared to tamoxifen. However, the reliability of the evidence was low meaning that further research is likely to have an impact on our confidence in this result.

6648c20d6429196c77d342d9,static_1,"Does cardiovascular training relieve cancer-related fatigue before, during, or after anticancer therapy?","To evaluate the effects of cardiovascular training on cancer-related fatigue (CRF), quality of life (QoL), adverse events, anxiety, and depression in people with cancer, with regard to their stage of anticancer therapy (before, during, or after), up to 12 weeks, up to six months, or longer, postintervention.
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov and World Health Organization ICTRP to identify studies that are included in the review. The latest search date was October 2023.
Moderate-certainty evidence shows that cardiovascular training by people with cancer during their anticancer therapy slightly reduces short-term CRF and results in little to no difference in short-term QoL. We do not know whether cardiovascular training increases or decreases medium-term CRF/QoL, and long-term CRF/QoL. There is very low-certainty evidence (due to heterogeneous definitions, reporting and measurement) evaluating whether the training increases or decreases adverse events. In people with cancer who perform cardiovascular training after anticancer therapy, we are uncertain about the effects on short-term CRF/QoL, long-term CRF/QoL, and adverse events. We identified a lack of evidence concerning cardiovascular training before anticancer therapy and on safety outcomes. The 36 ongoing and 12 completed, but unpublished, studies could help close this gap, and could contribute to improving the effect estimates and certainty.
This Cochrane review was funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research of Germany, grant number: FKZ 01KG2017.","What is cancer-related fatigue? Cancer-related fatigue is an extreme feeling of tiredness over a long period of time. It can be caused by cancer treatment or the cancer itself. It is the most common symptom among people with cancer. It cannot be relieved by rest, and it affects the body and mind. What is cardiovascular training? Cardiovascular training is any activity that uses the large muscle groups of the buttocks and thighs, and increases heart and breathing rate. Examples are walking, running, cycling, and swimming. Why is cardiovascular training possibly effective for cancer-related fatigue? Cancer-related fatigue is linked to the body's response to cytokines, which regulate how tissues and organs increase in size (called cell growth). Cancer or cancer therapy may produce proteins called pro-inflammatory cytokines, which cause or worsen inflammation (the body's response to an injury or illness). Cardiovascular training can help reduce inflammation. What did we want to find out? We wanted to know whether cardiovascular training reduces cancer-related fatigue compared to no training. We explored the effects at short (up to 12 weeks), medium (up to six months), and long term (longer than six months). We also looked at quality of life, unwanted effects, anxiety, and depression. What did we do? We searched for studies that investigated cardiovascular training before, during, or after anticancer therapy compared to no training. These studies needed to evaluate cancer-related fatigue or quality of life, or both. The cardiovascular training needed at least five exercise sessions and had to be provided face-to-face, either in person or by video. We excluded studies with fewer than 20 people per group or studies only available in short-summary form. What did we find? We found 23 studies with 2135 people, mostly women with breast cancer. Most studies were conducted in high-income countries. A total of 1101 people received cardiovascular training and 1034 received no training. We also found 36 ongoing studies and 12 completed but unpublished studies. Main results: There were no studies comparing cardiovascular training before anticancer therapy with no training. We included 10 studies of cardiovascular training during anticancer therapy but could use only eight in our analyses. For cardiovascular training after anticancer therapy versus no training, we found 13 studies but could use only nine. Cardiovascular training during anticancer therapy probably reduces short-term cancer-related fatigue slightly (6 studies, 593 people) and probably results in little to no difference in short-term quality of life (6 studies, 612 people). It is unclear whether cardiovascular training affects medium- or long-term fatigue, quality of life, or unwanted effects. For cardiovascular training after anticancer therapy, we do not know whether it increases or decreases short- or long-term fatigue, quality of life, or unwanted effects, and no data were available for medium-term effects. What are the limitations of the evidence? We are moderately confident in the evidence on short-term fatigue and quality of life during anticancer therapy. Our confidence in all other results is very low because the studies were fewer, smaller, or had design limitations such as lack of blinding. There was no evidence for cardiovascular training before anticancer therapy or for medium-term effects after therapy.",1015,cardiovascular training; cancer-related fatigue (CRF); quality of life (QoL); adverse events; anticancer therapy,How does the study differentiate the impact of cardiovascular training on cancer-related fatigue based on the timing of the training in relation to anticancer therapy?,What critical gaps in the research were identified regarding the effects of cardiovascular training on cancer-related fatigue and quality of life?,Select all of the following that are fruits,What is cancer-related fatigue?,"According to the summary, what effect does cardiovascular training during anticancer therapy have on short-term quality of life?","By comparing cardiovascular training outcomes before, during, and after anticancer therapy.; By evaluating different types of cardiovascular exercises separately.; By focusing only on the exercise intensity.","By comparing cardiovascular training outcomes before, during, and after anticancer therapy.",Lack of studies on training before anticancer therapy and unclear medium- and long-term effects.; Inadequate comparison between different cancer types.; Failure to include age as a significant variable.,Lack of studies on training before anticancer therapy and unclear medium- and long-term effects.,dog; blue; grape,grape,An extreme feeling of tiredness over a long period of time.; A short-lasting tiredness that can be relieved by rest.; A feeling of tiredness that only affects the mind.,An extreme feeling of tiredness over a long period of time.,It results in little to no difference.; It significantly improves quality of life.; It worsens quality of life.,It results in little to no difference.
6648c20d6429196c77d342d9,static_2,The timing of treatment for broken bones in the legs and arms that also have open wounds,"Open fractures of the major long bones are complex limb-threatening injuries that are predisposed to deep infection. Treatment includes antibiotics and surgery to debride the wound, stabilise the fracture and reconstruct any soft tissue defect to enable infection-free bone repair. There is a need to assess the effect of timing and duration of antibiotic administration and timing and staging of surgical interventions to optimise outcomes.
To assess the effects (risks and benefits) of the timing of antibiotic administration, wound debridement and the stages of surgical interventions in managing people with open long bone fractures of the upper and lower limbs.
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase and clinical trial registers in February 2021. We also searched conference proceedings and reference lists of included studies.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs that recruited adults with open fractures of the major long bones, comparing: 1) timings of prophylactic antibiotic treatment, 2) duration of prophylactic antibiotic treatment, 3) timing of wound debridement following injury or 4) timing of the stages of reconstructive surgery.
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We aimed to collect data for the following outcomes: limb function, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), deep surgical site infection, delayed or non-union, adverse events (in the short- and long-term course of recovery), and resource-related outcomes.
We included three RCTs of 613 randomised participants with 617 open fractures. Studies were conducted in medical and trauma centres in the USA and Kenya. Where reported, there was a higher proportion of men and a mean age of participants between 30 and 34 years old. Fractures were in the upper and lower limbs in one study, and were tibia fractures in two studies; where reported, these were the result of high-energy trauma such as road traffic accidents. No studies compared the timing of antibiotic treatment or wound debridement. Duration of prophylactic antibiotic treatment (1 study, 77 participants available for analysis) One study compared antibiotic treatment for 24 hours with antibiotic treatment for five days. We are very uncertain about the effects of different durations of antibiotic treatment on superficial infections (risk ratio (RR) 1.19, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.87, favours 5 day treatment; 1 study, 77 participants); this was very low-certainty evidence derived from one small study with unclear and high risks of bias, and with an imprecise effect estimate. This study reported no other review outcomes. Reconstructive surgery: timing of the stages of surgery (2 studies, 458 participants available for analysis) Two studies compared the timing of wound closure, which was completed immediately or delayed. In one study, the mean time of delay was 5.9 days; in the other study, the time of delay was not reported. We are very uncertain about the effects of different timings of wound closure on deep infections (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.80, favours immediate closure; 2 studies, 458 participants), delayed union or non-union (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.55, favours delayed closure; 1 study, 387 participants), or superficial infections (RR 6.45, 95% CI 0.35 to 120.43, favours delayed closure; 1 study, 71 participants); this was very low-certainty evidence. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence for very serious risks of bias because both studies had unclear and high risks of bias. We also downgraded for serious imprecision because effect estimates were imprecise, including the possibility of benefits as well as harms, and very serious imprecision when the data were derived from single small study. These studies reported no other review outcomes.
We could not determine the risks and benefits of different treatment protocols for open long bone fractures because the evidence was very uncertain for the two comparisons and we did not find any studies addressing the other possible comparisons. Well-designed randomised trials with adequate power are needed to guide surgical and antibiotic treatment of open fractures, particularly with regard to timing and duration of antibiotic administration and timing and staging of surgery.","Some broken bones include open skin wounds around the break. These are called open fractures and are most common in high impact injuries such as road traffic accidents or falls from a height. In this review, we were interested in the treatment of open fractures of long bones (in the thigh, shin, lower leg, upper arm and forearms). These fractures can be very serious injuries. Because of the open wound, people are at serious risk of infection. A 'deep infection' involves the bone and will require further surgery; it may be limb-threatening and affect long-term recovery.
- Antibiotics (to fight infection) may be started early (within an hour of injury) or later; they may be given for a short time (until the wound is surgically closed) or a longer time.
- Debridement: surgically removing any dirt, foreign objects, or dead and damaged tissue from inside the wound: this may be done early (within 12 hours of injury) or later.
- Treatment also includes surgery to fix the bone and close the wound (this may involve moving skin or muscle, or both, from another body area to cover the wound). All stages (debridement, fixing the bone, wound closure) may be completed during a single operation or in multiple operations. If this is done in multiple operations, the wound may be closed early (within 72 hours of injury) or later.
We searched for studies that compared one or more of these treatments for adults who had broken bones with open skin wounds. We wanted to find out the benefits and harms of these different treatments. If we found similar studies, of the same treatments, we combined the findings from the studies to see if we could find out if some treatment resulted in better outcomes.
We found three studies with 613 adults, who had 617 open fractures. Most fractures were in men, and the average age was 30 to 34 years. In two studies, the open fractures were in the shin bone (a common place for this type of injury because there is not much skin and muscle between the bone and skin surface). In the other study, injuries were in arms and legs.
One study compared giving antibiotics for 24 hours (short course) with five days of antibiotics (long course). It is unclear if these treatment times had an effect on the number of people who developed superficial infections within 14 days. Superficial infections are in the skin around the wound, but not deep enough to affect the bone; they may occur early in the recovery period and can be easily treated with antibiotics only.
Two studies compared closing the wound immediately after fixing the bone with a delay to closing the wound. It is unclear if timing of wound closure had an effect on the number of people who developed deep infections, superficial infections, or had delayed bone union (when the broken parts of the bone heal together more slowly than expected) or non-union (when the bone does not heal).
None of the studies looked at how well a person can move their injured arm or leg, or the health-related quality of life of people six to 12 months after treatment.
We found no studies that compared starting antibiotics immediately or later, whether wound cleaning started within 12 hours of the injury or later, or whether the different stages of treatment happened at the same time or separately.
We are not very confident in these findings because:
- we only had information from one small study about how long antibiotics are given, and from two studies about when the wound is closed;
- the studies were not well reported, and one was only reported in a short summary;
- all of the findings included the possibility of benefit (for example, fewer infections with a short course of antibiotics) as well as the possibility of harm (for example, more infections with a short course of antibiotics).",1054,open fractures; long bones; prophylactic antibiotic treatment; wound debridement; reconstructive surgery; deep surgical site infection; non-union; high-energy trauma; superficial infections; wound closure,What are the motivations behind examining the timing of antibiotic administration and surgical interventions in managing open long bone fractures?,What types of injuries are classified as open fractures?,Select all of the following that are fruits,Explain why immediate antibiotic administration might be considered for open fractures.,Summarize the uncertainty in outcomes related to wound closure timing.,To optimize treatment outcomes by reducing infection risks.; To assess the financial costs associated with various treatment methods.; To determine the psychological impact of open fractures on patients.,To optimize treatment outcomes by reducing infection risks.,Injuries with open skin wounds around the break; Closed bone fractures; Fractures that only occur in the upper limbs,Injuries with open skin wounds around the break,dog; blue; grape,grape,To reduce the risk of deep infection; To promote faster bone healing; To prevent muscle loss,To reduce the risk of deep infection,Unclear impact on infection rates and delayed healing; Clear advantage for immediate closure; Direct correlation with improved mobility,Unclear impact on infection rates and delayed healing
6648c20d6429196c77d342d9,static_2,Cannabis-based medicines for cancer pain,"Pain is a common symptom in people with cancer; 30% to 50% of people with cancer will experience moderate-to-severe pain. This can have a major negative impact on their quality of life. Opioid (morphine-like) medications are commonly used to treat moderate or severe cancer pain, and are recommended for this purpose in the World Health Organization (WHO) pain treatment ladder. Pain is not sufficiently relieved by opioid medications in 10% to 15% of people with cancer. In people with insufficient relief of cancer pain, new analgesics are needed to effectively and safely supplement or replace opioids. To evaluate the benefits and harms of cannabis-based medicines, including medical cannabis, for treating pain and other symptoms in adults with cancer compared to placebo or any other established analgesic for cancer pain. We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 26 January 2023. We selected double-blind randomised, controlled trials (RCT) of medical cannabis, plant-derived and synthetic cannabis-based medicines against placebo or any other active treatment for cancer pain in adults, with any treatment duration and at least 10 participants per treatment arm. We used standard Cochrane methods. The primary outcomes were 1. proportions of participants reporting no worse than mild pain; 2. Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) of much improved or very much improved and 3. withdrawals due to adverse events. Secondary outcomes were 4. number of participants who reported pain relief of 30% or greater and overall opioid use reduced or stable; 5. number of participants who reported pain relief of 30% or greater, or 50% or greater; 6. pain intensity; 7. sleep problems; 8. depression and anxiety; 9. daily maintenance and breakthrough opioid dosage; 10. dropouts due to lack of efficacy; 11. all central nervous system adverse events. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence for each outcome. We identified 14 studies involving 1823 participants. No study assessed the proportions of participants reporting no worse than mild pain on treatment by 14 days after start of treatment. We found five RCTs assessing oromucosal nabiximols (tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD)) or THC alone involving 1539 participants with moderate or severe pain despite opioid therapy. The double-blind periods of the RCTs ranged between two and five weeks. Four studies with a parallel design and 1333 participants were available for meta-analysis. There was moderate-certainty evidence that there was no clinically relevant benefit for proportions of PGIC much or very much improved (risk difference (RD) 0.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 0.12; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 16, 95% CI 8 to 100). There was moderate-certainty evidence for no clinically relevant difference in the proportion of withdrawals due to adverse events (RD 0.04, 95% CI 0 to 0.08; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 25, 95% CI 16 to endless). There was moderate-certainty evidence for no difference between nabiximols or THC and placebo in the frequency of serious adverse events (RD 0.02, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.07). There was moderate-certainty evidence that nabiximols and THC used as add-on treatment for opioid-refractory cancer pain did not differ from placebo in reducing mean pain intensity (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.19, 95% CI -0.40 to 0.02). There was low-certainty evidence that a synthetic THC analogue (nabilone) delivered over eight weeks was not superior to placebo in reducing pain associated with chemotherapy or radiochemotherapy in people with head and neck cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (2 studies, 89 participants, qualitative analysis). Analyses of tolerability and safety were not possible for these studies. There was low-certainty evidence that synthetic THC analogues were superior to placebo (SMD -0.98, 95% CI -1.36 to -0.60), but not superior to low-dose codeine (SMD 0.03, 95% CI -0.25 to 0.32; 5 single-dose trials; 126 participants) in reducing moderate-to-severe cancer pain after cessation of previous analgesic treatment for three to four and a half hours (2 single-dose trials; 66 participants). Analyses of tolerability and safety were not possible for these studies. There was low-certainty evidence that CBD oil did not add value to specialist palliative care alone in the reduction of pain intensity in people with advanced cancer. There was no difference in the number of dropouts due to adverse events and serious adverse events (1 study, 144 participants, qualitative analysis). We found no studies using herbal cannabis. There is moderate-certainty evidence that oromucosal nabiximols and THC are ineffective in relieving moderate-to-severe opioid-refractory cancer pain. There is low-certainty evidence that nabilone is ineffective in reducing pain associated with (radio-) chemotherapy in people with head and neck cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. There is low-certainty evidence that a single dose of synthetic THC analogues is not superior to a single low-dose morphine equivalent in reducing moderate-to-severe cancer pain. There is low-certainty evidence that CBD does not add value to specialist palliative care alone in the reduction of pain in people with advanced cancer.","One person in two or three who gets cancer will have pain that becomes moderate or severe in intensity. The pain tends to get worse as the cancer progresses.
The WHO recommends taking morphine-like medicines for moderate-to-severe pain from cancer, but 1 in 6 to 10 people with cancer pain do not experience sufficient pain relief from morphine-like medicines. Several products based on the cannabis plant have been suggested as treatment for cancer pain. These products include inhaled or orally ingested herbal cannabis, and various oils, sprays or tablets containing active cannabis ingredients obtained from the plant, or made synthetically. Some people with cancer pain have reported that CbMs are effective for them, and that is often highlighted in the media.
If CbMs relieved cancer pain in people living with cancer.
If CbMs were associated with any unwanted or harmful effects.
We searched for clinical trials that examined CbMs compared to other medications to treat cancer pain in adults.
We summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as the methods and size of studies.
We found 14 studies involving 1823 people. The biggest study included 399 people and the smallest study included 10 people.
Studies were conducted in countries around the world; most (six) were based in North America.
Five studies used one dose of CbM and lasted less than one day. Other studies lasted between two and eight weeks.
Pharmaceutical companies funded seven studies.
Six studies compared a mouth spray with a plant-derived combination of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the principal psychoactive constituent of cannabis, and cannabidiol (CBD), an anti-inflammatory ingredient of cannabis, against a fake medication (placebo). Seven studies compared an artificial cannabinoid mimicking the effects of THC against placebo. Of these seven studies, two studies compared against a morphine-like medication (codeine), too. One study compared CBD against placebo.
We did not find studies with herbal cannabis.
Mouth spray with a plant-derived combination of THC and CBD was probably not better than placebo in reducing pain in people with moderate-to-severe cancer pain despite opioid treatment. Thirty-two out of 100 people reported to be much or very much improved by cannabis-based mouth spray and 23 out of 100 people with mouth spray with placebo. A total of 19 out of 100 people withdrew early because of side effects by cannabis-based mouth spray and 16 out of 100 people by mouth spray with placebo. There was no difference in serious side effects between the cannabis-based mouth spray and a placebo mouth spray.
Artificial cannabinoid mimicking the effects of THC may not be better than a fake medication in reducing pain associated with chemotherapy or radiochemotherapy in people with head and neck cancer and a certain type of lung cancer.
A single dose of an artificial cannabinoid mimicking the effects of THC may be better than a single dose of placebo, but may not differ from a single small dose of a morphine-like medication in reducing moderate-to-severe cancer pain after cessation of previous analgesic treatment for three to four and a half hours.
CBD may not add value to specialist palliative care alone in the reduction of pain in people with advanced cancer.
We found no studies with medical cannabis.
We are moderately confident in the evidence that a mouth spray with a plant-derived combination of THC and CBD does not reduce severe cancer pain despite opioid treatment because studies did not provide information about everything that we could have used.
We have little confidence in the evidence that an artificial cannabinoid mimicking the effects of THC (nabilone) does not reduce pain associated with chemotherapy or radiochemotherapy because the studies did not provide data about everything that we could have used, and because the studies were small.
We have little confidence in the evidence that artificial cannabinoids mimicking the effects of THC reduce cancer pain after the previous pain-relieving medication was stopped some hours before because the studies did not provide data about everything that we could have used, and because the studies were small.
We have little confidence in the evidence that CBD added to standard palliative care does not reduce cancer pain because there was only one study available.",1016,Opioid-refractory; oromucosal nabiximols; tetrahydrocannabinol (THC); cannabidiol (CBD); patient global impression of change (PGIC); synthetic THC analogue; analgesic treatment; chemotherapy; radiochemotherapy; adverse events,How do the study results challenge the potential use of cannabis-based medicines as alternatives to opioids for cancer pain?,What was a key motivation for the study?,Select all of the following that are colors,What was the outcome of using a mouth spray with THC and CBD for cancer pain?,"In the study, how did artificial cannabinoids perform compared to codeine?",There is no strong evidence that CbMs offer superior pain relief to opioids.; CbMs consistently showed better results than placebo.; CbMs treatments are associated with fewer side effects than opioids.,There is no strong evidence that CbMs offer superior pain relief to opioids.,To determine the effectiveness of CbMs in cancer pain relief.; To find new synthetic drugs for cancer treatment.; To evaluate the cost of cancer treatments.,To determine the effectiveness of CbMs in cancer pain relief.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,It was more effective than placebo.; It did not show significant improvement over placebo.; It cured the pain completely.,It did not show significant improvement over placebo.,They were superior in reducing pain.; They showed no difference in pain reduction.; They were less effective than codeine.,They showed no difference in pain reduction.
6648c20d6429196c77d342d9,interactive_3,Does taxation of unprocessed sugar or foods with added sugar reduce their consumption and prevent obesity or other adverse health outcomes?,"Global prevalence of overweight and obesity are alarming. For tackling this public health problem, preventive public health and policy actions are urgently needed. Some countries implemented food taxes in the past and some were subsequently abolished. Some countries, such as Norway, Hungary, Denmark, Bermuda, Dominica, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and the Navajo Nation (USA), specifically implemented taxes on unprocessed sugar and sugar-added foods. These taxes on unprocessed sugar and sugar-added foods are fiscal policy interventions, implemented to decrease their consumption and in turn reduce adverse health-related, economic and social effects associated with these food products. To assess the effects of taxation of unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods in the general population on the consumption of unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods, the prevalence and incidence of overweight and obesity, and the prevalence and incidence of other diet-related health outcomes. We searched CENTRAL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, Embase and 15 other databases and trials registers on 12 September 2019. We handsearched the reference list of all records of included studies, searched websites of international organisations and institutions, and contacted review advisory group members to identify planned, ongoing or unpublished studies. We included studies with the following populations: children (0 to 17 years) and adults (18 years or older) from any country and setting. Exclusion applied to studies with specific subgroups, such as people with any disease who were overweight or obese as a side-effect of the disease. The review included studies with taxes on or artificial increases of selling prices for unprocessed sugar or food products that contain added sugar (e.g. sweets, ice cream, confectionery, and bakery products), or both, as intervention, regardless of the taxation level or price increase. In line with Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) criteria, we included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-randomised controlled trials (cRCTs), non-randomised controlled trials (nRCTs), controlled before-after (CBA) studies, and interrupted time series (ITS) studies. We included controlled studies with more than one intervention or control site and ITS studies with a clearly defined intervention time and at least three data points before and three after the intervention. Our primary outcomes were consumption of unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods, energy intake, overweight, and obesity. Our secondary outcomes were substitution and diet, expenditure, demand, and other health outcomes. Two review authors independently screened all eligible records for inclusion, assessed the risk of bias, and performed data extraction.Two review authors independently assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We retrieved a total of 24,454 records. After deduplicating records, 18,767 records remained for title and abstract screening. Of 11 potentially relevant studies, we included one ITS study with 40,210 household-level observations from the Hungarian Household Budget and Living Conditions Survey. The baseline ranged from January 2008 to August 2011, the intervention was implemented on September 2011, and follow-up was until December 2012 (16 months). The intervention was a tax - the so-called 'Hungarian public health product tax' - on sugar-added foods, including selected foods exceeding a specific sugar threshold value. The intervention includes co-interventions: the taxation of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) and of foods high in salt or caffeine. The study provides evidence on the effect of taxing foods exceeding a specific sugar threshold value on the consumption of sugar-added foods. After implementation of the Hungarian public health product tax, the mean consumption of taxed sugar-added foods (measured in units of kg) decreased by 4.0% (standardised mean difference (SMD) ?0.040, 95% confidence interval (CI) ?0.07 to ?0.01; very low-certainty evidence). The study was at low risk of bias in terms of performance bias, detection bias and reporting bias, with the shape of effect pre-specified and the intervention unlikely to have any effect on data collection. The study was at unclear risk of attrition bias and at high risk in terms of other bias and the independence of the intervention. We rated the certainty of the evidence as very low for the primary and secondary outcomes. The Hungarian public health product tax included a tax on sugar-added foods but did not include a tax on unprocessed sugar. We did not find eligible studies reporting on the taxation of unprocessed sugar. No studies reported on the primary outcomes of consumption of unprocessed sugar, energy intake, overweight, and obesity. No studies reported on the secondary outcomes of substitution and diet, demand, and other health outcomes. No studies reported on differential effects across population subgroups. We could not perform meta-analyses or pool study results. There was very limited evidence and the certainty of the evidence was very low. Despite the reported reduction in consumption of taxed sugar-added foods, we are uncertain whether taxing unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods has an effect on reducing their consumption and preventing obesity or other adverse health outcomes. Further robustly conducted studies are required to draw concrete conclusions on the effectiveness of taxing unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods for reducing their consumption and preventing obesity or other adverse health outcomes.","As outlined by the World Health Organization, 'globesity' (the rise in overweight and obesity globally) is a major world challenge. A sugar-rich diet, especially when combined with physical inactivity, may cause overweight and obesity, and other harmful health outcomes. There are direct costs to healthcare services of people being overweight or obese, such as preventing and treating health problems that this causes. There are also costs to society as a whole when people who are ill through being overweight or obese are unable to work. This review may be of interest to government public health agencies, policy decision-makers, food retailers, and food industries. This review and subsequent updates of this review may change policy and affect a government's motivation to create a tax on unprocessed sugar and foods with added sugar. It also may motivate food industries to reformulate their products to contain lower levels of added sugar. We wanted to know if taxation of unprocessed sugar and foods with added sugar (other than sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs)) reduced their consumption, changed people's energy intake, and reduced overweight and obesity. We also wanted to know if taxation changed people's diet and spending, and had an effect on other diet-related health problems. We searched for ongoing or published studies up to October 2019. Of a total of 24,454 records retrieved, we identified one 'interrupted time series' (ITS) study meeting our eligibility criteria to assess the impact of a tax on sugar-added foods (but not unprocessed sugar). The study used data from the Hungarian Household Budget and Living Conditions Survey, with observations from 40,210 households. Evidence from the study included a 'baseline' (the situation before taxation), ranging from January 2008 to August 2011. The Hungarian public health product tax was implemented on September 2011. The duration of the follow-up period (measuring the effects of taxation) was 16 months. The study was funded by the Scottish Institute for Research in Economics (SIRE) Early Career Engagement Grant. The included study provided very limited evidence that taxing foods with added sugar reduced their consumption by 4%. We are very uncertain about this evidence because the study did not use the strongest methods, looked at other kinds of taxation as well as taxing foods with added sugar, and may not have correctly classified food types. We are uncertain whether taxing foods with added sugar has an effect on reducing their consumption. The included study did not investigate the effects of taxing unprocessed sugar. Further research is needed to assess the effectiveness of taxing unprocessed sugar or foods with added sugar for reducing their consumption and preventing obesity or other adverse health outcomes. Studies should take place in countries that have implemented these taxes and should look at cost-effectiveness as well as the health benefits of taxing unprocessed sugar or foods with added sugar as a public health policy for preventing overweight, obesity or other adverse health outcomes. Countries that have implemented these taxes are Bermuda, Dominica, Hungary, India, Norway, the Navajo Nation (USA), and St. Vincent and Grenadines.",1103,overweight and obesity; preventive public health; fiscal policy interventions; Hungarian public health product tax; sugar-sweetened beverages; very low-certainty evidence; consumption of sugar-added foods; prevalence and incidence; demand and other health outcomes,Evaluate the impact of sugar taxation on public health policy motivation.,What potential effects on food reformulation might result from this study's findings?,Select all of the following that are fruits,Analyze the reasons for including various countries with implemented sugar taxes in the study.,Judge the reliability of the study based on the methods used to assess sugar consumption reduction.,It may motivate policy changes to implement sugar taxes.; It provides conclusive evidence to halt all sugar taxes.; It discourages future research on sugar taxation policies.,It may motivate policy changes to implement sugar taxes.,Industries could reduce added sugar in products.; Industries might eliminate all sugar from products.; Industries will increase sugar content to boost sales.,Industries could reduce added sugar in products.,dog; blue; grape,grape,To provide a comprehensive review of international tax efficacy.; To identify global trends in sugar consumption reduction.; To facilitate the exploration of diverse tax-related health outcomes.,To facilitate the exploration of diverse tax-related health outcomes.,The methods used were robust and reliable.; The study lacked strong methods and classifications.; The reliability was high due to the large sample size.,The study lacked strong methods and classifications.
6648c20d6429196c77d342d9,interactive_4,D-dimer for excluding pulmonary embolism in hospital outpatient and accident and emergency populations,"Pulmonary embolism (PE) occurs when a blood clot travels through the bloodstream and becomes lodged in the arteries of the lungs, blocking blood flow. People are more likely to develop PE if they have cancer, have recently undergone surgery, have been immobile for long periods, or are pregnant. Symptoms can vary but often include sudden shortness of breath, chest pain, and rapid breathing. Because these symptoms are common and can be caused by many conditions, accurate and efficient testing is important. D-dimers are small protein fragments released into the blood when the body breaks down a blood clot. The D-dimer test is widely used because it is quick, simple, inexpensive, and helps rule out venous thromboembolism (VTE), including PE. A normal D-dimer level makes the presence of a new blood clot very unlikely, helping avoid the need for more expensive or invasive imaging tests. This review assessed how well the D-dimer test can rule out acute PE in adults seen in outpatient clinics or emergency departments. All patients in the included studies had their pre-test probability (PTP) of PE determined using a clinical prediction rule (CPR), and none were already taking anticoagulants. The review included cross-sectional studies that compared D-dimer testing with established imaging standards such as ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scans, CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA), selective pulmonary angiography, or magnetic resonance pulmonary angiography (MRPA). D-dimer methods included quantitative, semi-quantitative, and qualitative assays. Four studies involving 1585 participants met the inclusion criteria. None were judged to be at high risk of bias, although some methodological details were unclear. Across all studies, D-dimer tests showed consistently high sensitivity meaning they correctly identified most people with PE with sensitivity ranging from 80% to 100%. However, specificity was low (23% to 63%), resulting in many false-positive results, especially among adults over 65 years old. This means that while a normal D-dimer level strongly suggests the absence of PE, an elevated D-dimer level is common and not specific to PE, often prompting further testing. Overall, the evidence shows that a negative D-dimer result is a reliable way to rule out PE in patients who have a low pre-test probability. One study suggested that the test may be less helpful in older adults because D-dimer levels tend to rise naturally with age, but there is currently no direct evidence supporting the use of higher diagnostic thresholds for people over 65. More research is needed to determine whether age-adjusted thresholds improve accuracy without increasing risk.","To investigate the ability of the D-dimer test to rule out a diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients treated in hospital outpatient and accident and emergency (A&E) departments.
Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a serious, potentially fatal condition that occurs when a blood clot becomes lodged in the blood vessels of the lungs. When people arrive to hospital A&E departments reporting difficulty breathing, breathlessness and chest pain, several explanations are possible but a quick diagnosis is needed. Tests that are available to detect blood clots in the lungs can be invasive and time-consuming, can carry a radiation burden and may be costly. Quick, easy-to-use and inexpensive tests that can be used to rule out the diagnosis would be very valuable.
One such test is the D-dimer test, which is so named because it detects small pieces of protein in the blood, which are called D-dimer. When someone with symptoms of breathlessness and chest pain arrives to the hospital A&E department, the staff conducts an examination and asks questions about the patient's medical history and lifestyle. This helps them to calculate a score for the patient's risk that symptoms are due to a PE.
If the score shows that they are at high risk of a blood clot in the lungs, patients undergo diagnostic scanning immediately (or are treated while test results are awaited). A D-dimer test can be ordered for people in low or moderate (or unlikely) risk groups; a negative D-dimer result might rule out the diagnosis of PE without the need for imaging.
This review considered all evidence provided by studies that assess the ability of D-dimer to rule out PE in people attending hospital outpatient and A&E departments.
We assessed all available reports from a wide search of databases of medical literature. Two review authors independently assessed studies that met the review criteria, including use of a study design called a cross-sectional study; inclusion of people with symptoms of PE who attended hospital outpatient and A&E departments; use of a risk score and then a D-dimer test; and comparison of results of the D-dimer test against the results of the very best available tests - ventilation/perfusion scanning (V/Q scanning), pulmonary angiography, computerised tomography pulmonary angiography, and magnetic resonance pulmonary angiography.
The flow of patients and the timing of D-dimer and reference standard tests were of greatest methodological concern; no study authors provided a flow diagram to show the flow of patients throughout their study, and only one study clearly reported the time between administration of index and reference standard tests. In the remaining three studies, timing between conduct of the index test and completion of the reference standard was not clearly reported, leading to an unclear classification of bias.
Limited evidence from the studies included in this review suggests that quantitative D-dimer tests used in emergency departments have few false-negatives but very high levels of false-positive results, with a high level of sensitivity consistently evident across all age groups. This makes the test useful as a rule-out test but means that a positive result requires diagnostic imaging.",1051,Pulmonary embolism; D-dimer; pre-test probability; ventilation/perfusion scans; CT pulmonary angiography; selective pulmonary angiography; magnetic resonance pulmonary angiography; sensitivity; specificity,How do the motivations for conducting the D-dimer test studies reflect the challenges faced in diagnosing pulmonary embolism in emergency settings?,How can the high sensitivity but low specificity of the D-dimer test be organized into a diagnostic approach for ruling out PE?,Select all of the following that are colors,How is sensitivity of the D-dimer test described across different age groups?,What is the primary reason for conducting further diagnostic imaging after a positive D-dimer test result?,The studies aim to reduce the need for invasive and costly tests in emergency settings.; The studies aim to establish a higher diagnostic threshold for older adults.; The studies aim to exclusively use quantitative methods for D-dimer testing.,The studies aim to reduce the need for invasive and costly tests in emergency settings.,"Use the D-dimer test to rule out PE in low-risk patients, followed by imaging for positive results.; Apply the D-dimer test only after imaging has been completed.; Ignore the D-dimer test results unless the patient is under 40 years of age.","Use the D-dimer test to rule out PE in low-risk patients, followed by imaging for positive results.",blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,High sensitivity across all age groups; Low sensitivity in young adults; Inconsistent sensitivity,High sensitivity across all age groups,The D-dimer test has high levels of false positives; To confirm the presence of cancer; To estimate lung capacity,The D-dimer test has high levels of false positives
6648c20d6429196c77d342d9,interactive_4,"Improving the implementation of healthy eating, physical activity and obesity prevention policies, practices or programmes in childcare services","Despite the existence of effective interventions and best-practice guideline recommendations for childcare services to implement evidence-based policies, practices and programmes to promote child healthy eating, physical activity and prevent unhealthy weight gain, many services fail to do so. The primary aim of the review was to examine the effectiveness of strategies aimed at improving the implementation of policies, practices or programmes by childcare services that promote child healthy eating, physical activity and/or obesity prevention.The secondary aims of the review were to: 1. Examine the cost or cost-effectiveness of such strategies;2. Examine any adverse effects of such strategies on childcare services, service staff or children;3. Examine the effect of such strategies on child diet, physical activity or weight status. 4. Describe the acceptability, adoption, penetration, sustainability and appropriateness of such implementation strategies. We searched the following electronic databases on February 22 2019: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In Process, Embase, PsycINFO, ERIC, CINAHL and SCOPUS for relevant studies. We searched reference lists of included studies, handsearched two international implementation science journals, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (www.who.int/ictrp/) and ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov). We included any study (randomised or nonrandomised) with a parallel control group that compared any strategy to improve the implementation of a healthy eating, physical activity or obesity prevention policy, practice or programme by staff of centre-based childcare services to no intervention, 'usual' practice or an alternative strategy. Centre-based childcare services included preschools, nurseries, long daycare services and kindergartens catering for children prior to compulsory schooling (typically up to the age of five to six years).
Two review authors independently screened study titles and abstracts, extracted study data and assessed risk of bias; we resolved discrepancies via consensus. We performed meta-analysis using a random-effects model where studies with suitable data and homogeneity were identified; otherwise, findings were described narratively. Twenty-one studies, including 16 randomised and five nonrandomised, were included in the review. The studies sought to improve the implementation of policies, practices or programmes targeting healthy eating (six studies), physical activity (three studies) or both healthy eating and physical activity (12 studies). Studies were conducted in the United States (n = 12), Australia (n = 8) and Ireland (n = 1). Collectively, the 21 studies included a total of 1945 childcare services examining a range of implementation strategies including educational materials, educational meetings, audit and feedback, opinion leaders, small incentives or grants, educational outreach visits or academic detailing, reminders and tailored interventions. Most studies (n = 19) examined implementation strategies versus usual practice or minimal support control, and two compared alternative implementation strategies. For implementation outcomes, six studies (one RCT) were judged to be at high risk of bias overall. The review findings suggest that implementation strategies probably improve the implementation of policies, practices or programmes that promote child healthy eating, physical activity and/or obesity prevention in childcare services. Of the 19 studies that compared a strategy to usual practice or minimal support control, 11 studies (nine RCTs) used score-based measures of implementation (e.g. childcare service nutrition environment score). Nine of these studies were included in pooled analysis, which found an improvement in implementation outcomes (SMD 0.49; 95% CI 0.19 to 0.79; participants = 495; moderate-certainty evidence). Ten studies (seven RCTs) used dichotomous measures of implementation (e.g. proportion of childcare services implementing a policy or specific practice), with seven of these included in pooled analysis (OR 1.83; 95% CI 0.81 to 4.11; participants = 391; low-certainty evidence). Findings suggest that such interventions probably lead to little or no difference in child physical activity (four RCTs; moderate-certainty evidence) or weight status (three RCTs; moderate-certainty evidence), and may lead to little or no difference in child diet (two RCTs; low-certainty evidence). None of the studies reported the cost or cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Three studies assessed the adverse effects of the intervention on childcare service staff, children and parents, with all studies suggesting they have little to no difference in adverse effects (e.g. child injury) between groups (three RCTs; low-certainty evidence). Inconsistent quality of the evidence was identified across review outcomes and study designs, ranging from very low to moderate. The primary limitation of the review was the lack of conventional terminology in implementation science, which may have resulted in potentially relevant studies failing to be identified based on the search terms used. Current research suggests that implementation strategies probably improve the implementation of policies, practices or programmes by childcare services, and may have little or no effect on measures of adverse effects. However such strategies appear to have little to no impact on measures of child diet, physical activity or weight status.","This review aimed to look at the effects of strategies to improve the implementation (or correct undertaking) of policies, practices or programmes by childcare services that promote children's healthy eating, physical activity and/or obesity prevention. We wanted to determine the cost or cost-effectiveness of providing implementation support, whether support strategies were associated with any adverse effects, and whether there was an impact on child nutrition, physical activity or weight status. We also looked at the implementation strategy acceptability, adoption, penetration, sustainability and appropriateness. A number of childcare service-based interventions have been found to be effective in improving child diet, increasing child physical activity and preventing excessive weight gain. Despite the existence of such evidence and best-practice guideline recommendations for childcare services to implement these policies, practices or programmes, many childcare services fail to do so. Without proper implementation, children will not benefit from these child health-directed policies, practices or programmes. We identified 21 studies, 19 of which examined implementation strategies versus usual practice or minimal support control, and two that compared different types of implementation strategies. The studies sought to improve the implementation of policies, practices or programmes targeting healthy eating (six studies), physical activity (three studies) or both healthy eating and physical activity (twelve studies). Collectively, the 21 included studies included a total of 1945 childcare services and examined a range of implementation strategies including educational materials, educational meetings, audit and feedback, opinion leaders, small incentives or grants, educational outreach visits or academic detailing, reminders and tailored interventions. The strategies tested were only a small number of those that could be applied to improve implementation in this setting. Findings suggest that implementation support strategies can improve the implementation of physical activity policies, programmes or practices by childcare services or their staff (moderate-certainty evidence), and do not appear to increase the risk of child injury (low-certainty evidence). However, such approaches do not appear to have an impact on the diet, physical activity or weight status of children (low to moderate-certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported information regarding implementation strategy costs or measures of cost-effectiveness.

6648c20d6429196c77d342d9,finetuned_5,Treatments to reduce body temperature to 35C in people who are in hospital after a traumatic brain injury,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and disability, with an estimated 5.5 million people experiencing severe TBI worldwide every year. Observational clinical studies suggest a link between raised body temperature and unfavourable outcomes, though findings are inconsistent. Preclinical models indicate that reducing temperature to 35C to 37.5C may improve biological outcomes compared to deeper cooling (33C). It remains unknown whether reducing body temperature to 35C in people admitted to hospital with TBI is beneficial, neutral, or harmful. This review updates a previous version published in 2014. We aimed to assess the effects of pharmacological or physical interventions designed to reduce body temperature to 35C in adults and children hospitalised after TBI. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, PubMed, clinical trial registers, grey literature, reference lists, and forward citations up to 28 November 2019. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving participants of any age admitted after TBI and receiving interventions intended to lower body temperature within the target range, including medications (paracetamol, NSAIDs) or physical cooling methods (surface cooling devices, bedside fans, cooled intravenous fluids). Eligible comparators were placebo or usual care. Two authors independently assessed studies, extracted data, and evaluated risk of bias, using GRADE to assess certainty of evidence. Only one RCT with 41 adult participants, conducted in two Australian intensive care units, met the criteria. Participants received intravenous paracetamol (1 g every four hours for 72 hours) or a matched placebo. We were uncertain whether paracetamol influenced 28-day mortality (risk ratio 2.86, 95% CI 0.32 to 25.24). The certainty of evidence was very low due to imprecision (small sample size) and selective reporting concerns, although other risks of bias were low. The study did not report the primary outcome of poor outcome at follow-up (death or dependency) or any secondary outcomes of interest, including intracranial or extracranial haemorrhage, abnormal intracranial pressure, or pneumonia or other serious infections. We found one additional completed trial of a physical intervention (advanced fever control using a surface cooling device versus standard fever control in 12 participants), but it was published only as an abstract with insufficient details for inclusion; it is listed as awaiting classification pending further information. Four ongoing trials may contribute data to future updates if they report relevant outcomes and provide separate results for participants with TBI when mixed populations are included. In conclusion, one small study contributed very low-certainty evidence on mortality. Overall uncertainty is driven by extremely limited research on interventions aimed at reducing body temperature to 35C after TBI. More research evaluating both pharmacological and physical interventions is needed. Future studies should include outcomes important to patients, such as side effects (e.g., nausea, vomiting) and discomfort caused by cooling therapies.","Traumatic brain injury occurs when direct force to the headsuch as from a road traffic accident or a fall causes damage to the brain. It is a major global health problem, affecting about 5.5 million people each year. Injury occurs in two stages: first at the moment of impact, and then over the following hours to weeks as secondary damage develops. Treatment aims to limit this secondary damage. Some evidence suggests that people with normal body temperature after injury may have better outcomes than those with elevated temperatures. This review examined whether medicines or non-drug physical cooling methods that reduce body temperature to between 35C improve outcomes for adults or children hospitalized after traumatic brain injury. We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs)the most reliable type of evidence up to 28 November 2019. Only one small RCT with 41 participants was found. It compared intravenous paracetamol, given for 72 hours, with an intravenous salt solution made to look identical. No published trials assessed other medicines or physical cooling methods such as cooling blankets, ice, fans, or cooled fluids. One very small study of physical cooling was identified but lacked enough information for inclusion, and four ongoing studies may provide future evidence. Some of these include mixed types of brain injury, and we will only be able to use them if they report traumatic brain injury results separately. We were uncertain whether paracetamol reduced deaths within 28 days because the study was very small and did not originally plan to report mortality. It also did not report any of our key outcomes, such as poor functional outcome (death or dependency), serious bleeding inside or outside the brain, raised intracranial pressure, pneumonia, or other infections. Although the study methods were generally sound, the lack of pre-specified reporting increased the risk of bias. With only one small study, the certainty of the evidence was very low, meaning the true effects may be very different from what was reported. Overall, we remain uncertain whether medicines or physical cooling treatments that lower body temperature to 35C benefit people in hospital after traumatic brain injury. More and larger studies are needed, and future updates will assess side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and discomfort, which we hope ongoing and future research will report.",1056,Traumatic brain injury; pharmacological interventions; physical cooling methods; certainty of evidence; imprecision; intracranial pressure; extracranial haemorrhage; pneumonia; advanced fever control,What were the motivations for the study's focus on cooling treatments for TBI?,Which factors contributed to the uncertainty of the study results on paracetamol?,Select all of the following that are colors,"Based on the study, what can be concluded about the use of cooling methods in reducing TBI mortality rates?",Explain the main goal of the study in your own words.,Elevated body temperatures suggest potentially worse outcomes for TBI patients.; Normal body temperature is universally accepted to improve brain injury outcomes.; Cooling treatments have been consistently proven in other unrelated medical contexts.,Elevated body temperatures suggest potentially worse outcomes for TBI patients.,The study used a too short duration of treatment.; The small sample size and lack of pre-planned mortality reporting.; The study confirmed that all key outcomes were reported comprehensively.,The small sample size and lack of pre-planned mortality reporting.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,The study provides strong evidence that cooling methods reduce mortality.; Cooling methods' impact on mortality is uncertain due to the study's limited scope.; Mortality rates increase significantly with the use of cooling methods.,Cooling methods' impact on mortality is uncertain due to the study's limited scope.,To determine if cooling to 35-37.5Â°C improves outcomes after TBI; To establish the best surgical intervention for TBI; To identify genetic markers of TBI,To determine if cooling to 35-37.5Â°C improves outcomes after TBI
6648c20d6429196c77d342d9,finetuned_6,Do dietary and activity strategies help prevent obesity in children aged 2 to 4 years?,"To assess the effects of interventions that aimed to prevent obesity in children aged two to four years by changing dietary intake or activity levels, or both, on body mass index (BMI), BMI z-score (zBMI), BMI percentile, and serious adverse events. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, six other databases, and two trial registers, together with reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors to identify eligible studies. The latest search date was 7 February 2023. In early childhood, combined dietary/activity interventions may have very modest benefits on BMI and zBMI at long-term follow-up. When implemented alone, dietary or activity interventions may have little to no effect on BMI measures. Only six studies reported serious adverse events, with no serious harms resulting directly from the intervention, but the evidence is very uncertain.","There is an increasing number of young children living with overweight and obesity worldwide, with evidence of the rates increasing in line with social inequality. Living with overweight during childhood can cause physical and psychological health problems. Children living with overweight are more likely to live with overweight as adults, and continue to experience poor physical and mental health. We wanted to find out if strategies to help people change diet or activity (or both) are effective at preventing obesity in children aged 2 to 4 years, and whether they are associated with any serious adverse events. To examine obesity, we used the measure of body mass index (BMI). BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by their height (in m2). We searched for studies that looked at ways to prevent obesity in children aged 2 to 4 years. We did not include studies that only targeted children who were already living with overweight or obesity, but we did include studies involving children at a range of weights. We only included studies if they used methods aimed at changing children's diet, activity level (increasing physical activity or reducing sedentary behaviour), or both. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We grouped studies together for analysis depending on whether they aimed to improve diet, activity, or both. We found 67 studies involving 36,601 children aged 2 to 4 years. Most studies (63 of 67) were based in high-income countries, and four in upper-middle-income countries. In 26 studies, the strategies were conducted in childcare settings, 23 studies were primarily home-based, and 10 were performed in both childcare and home-based settings. Only 3 studies were conducted in the community, and 5 in healthcare settings. The duration of the programmes varied: 47 ran for fewer than 9 months, with the shortest being 1 visit and the longest lasting 3 years. We analysed results from 56 studies involving 21,404 children. Children who were helped with a strategy to change their diet and activity levels may have had a reduced BMI, compared with children not given any strategy. This means that these children may have been able to minimise excess weight gain by a small amount, which, for public health, is important. Children who were helped with a strategy to change their diet or activity alone did not have a reduced BMI. Only six of the 67 included studies reported on serious adverse events, and no serious harms were identified. Overall, our confidence in the evidence is very low. However, we do not believe that results from more studies similar in design to those included in this review would produce a higher level of confidence in the results. Four main factors reduced our confidence in the evidence. Results were very inconsistent across different studies. There were not enough studies reporting specific types of outcomes for a particular duration of follow-up to be certain about the results for some comparisons. Results from some studies were not reported in a way that we could include in our analyses and this may have had an impact on the combined results. Studies generally had limitations in how they were conducted, due to the complexity of studies in this age group. This review does not provide enough information to assess how well these strategies work for children with disabilities or those from low- and middle-income countries.",1102,interventions; dietary intake; activity levels; body mass index; BMI z-score; BMI percentile; serious adverse events; long-term follow-up; dietary/activity interventions; serious harms,What changes would improve the overall confidence in the evidence provided by the studies reviewed?,What criteria were used to include studies in the review?,Select the items that are animals,Describe the impact of combined dietary and activity interventions on BMI.,Explain the significance of implementing strategies that involve both diet and activity for public health.,More consistent data reporting; Broader geographic diversity of study locations; Stronger adverse event monitoring,More consistent data reporting; Broader geographic diversity of study locations,Strategies aimed at changing children's diet or activity; Targeting children already living with obesity; Involvement of children across a range of weights,Strategies aimed at changing children's diet or activity; Involvement of children across a range of weights,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,They may slightly reduce BMI.; They have no effect on BMI.; They significantly reduce BMI.,They may slightly reduce BMI.,They help minimize excess weight gain.; They eliminate obesity completely.; They have no relevance to public health.,They help minimize excess weight gain.
6648c20d6429196c77d342d9,finetuned_6,Integrated compared with non-integrated orbital implants for treating anophthalmic sockets,"Anophthalmia is the absence of one or both eyes, and it can be congenital (i.e. a birth defect) or acquired later in life. There are two main types of orbital implant: integrated, whereby the implant receives a blood supply from the body that allows for the integration of the prosthesis within the tissue; and non-integrated, where the implant remains separate. Despite the remarkable progress in anophthalmic socket reconstruction and in the development of various types of implants, there are still uncertainties about the real roles of integrated (hydroxyapatite (HA), porous polyethylene (PP), composites) and non-integrated (polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA)/acrylic and silicone) orbital implants in anophthalmic socket treatment.
To assess the effects of integrated versus non-integrated orbital implants for treating anophthalmic sockets.
We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2016, Issue 7), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to August 2016), Embase (January 1980 to August 2016), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (1982 to August 2016), the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov), and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 8 August 2016.
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of integrated and non-integrated orbital implants for treating anophthalmic sockets.
Two authors independently selected relevant trials, assessed methodological quality and extracted data.
We included three studies with a total of 284 participants (250 included in analysis). The studies were conducted in India, Iran and the Netherlands. The three studies were clinically heterogenous, comparing different materials and using different surgical techniques. None of the included studies used a peg (i.e. a fixing pin used to connect the implant to the prosthesis). In general the trials were poorly reported, and we judged them to be at unclear risk of bias. One trial compared HA using traditional enucleation versus alloplastic implantation using evisceration (N = 100). This trial was probably not masked. The second trial compared PP with scleral cap enucleation versus PMMA with either myoconjunctival or traditional enucleation (N = 150). Although participants were not masked, outcome assessors were. The last trial compared HA and acrylic using the enucleation technique (N = 34) but did not report comparative effectiveness data. In the trial comparing HA versus alloplastic implantation, there was no evidence of any difference between the two groups with respect to the proportion of successful procedures at one year (risk ratio (RR) 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95 to 1.09, N = 100, low-certainty evidence). People receiving HA had slightly worse horizontal implant mobility compared to the alloplastic group (mean difference (MD) -3.35 mm, 95% CI - 4.08 to - 2.62, very low-certainty evidence) and slightly worse vertical implant motility (MD -2.76 mm, 95% CI -3.45 to -2.07, very low-certainty evidence). As different techniques were used - enucleation versus evisceration - it is not clear whether these differences in implant motility can be attributed solely to the type of material. Investigators did not report adverse events. In the trial comparing PP versus PMMA, there was no evidence of any difference between the two groups with respect to the proportion of successful procedures at one year (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.01, N = 150, low-certainty evidence). There was very low-certainty evidence of a difference in horizontal implant motility depending on whether PP was compared to PMMA with traditional enucleation (MD 1.96 mm, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.91) or PMMA with myoconjunctival enucleation (-0.57 mm, 95% CI -1.63 to 0.49). Similarly, for vertical implant motility, there was very low-certainty evidence of a difference in the comparison of PP to PMMA traditional (MD 3.12 mm 95% CI 2.36 to 3.88) but no evidence of a difference when comparing PP to PMMA myoconjunctival (MD -0.20 mm 95% CI  -1.28 to 0.88). Four people in the PP group (total N = 50) experienced adverse events (i.e. exposures) compared to 6/100 in the PMMA groups (RR 17.82, 95% CI 0.98 to 324.67, N = 150, very low-certainty evidence). None of the studies reported socket sphere size, cosmetic effect or quality of life measures.
Current very low-certainty evidence from three small published randomised controlled trials did not provide sufficient evidence to assess the effect of integrated and non-integrated material orbital implants for treating anophthalmic sockets. This review underlines the need to conduct further well-designed trials in this field.","The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out if integrated orbital implants are better than non-integrated orbital implants for treating anophthalmic sockets. Cochrane researchers collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found three studies.
There is uncertainty as to the benefits and harms of integrated compared with non-integrated orbital implants. What was studied in the review? 'Anophthalmia' is the absence of the eye in the orbit. This can occur in childhood (because of problems with development) or it can happen during the course of life (due to an accident or other eye disease).
Doctors can put an implant in the orbit to fill the void left by the removal of the eye and this together with an external prosthesis can improve the patient's appearance. This orbital implant can be made of two types of materials - integrated or non-integrated material. If the material is integrated, then new blood vessels can grow into the implant material. If the material is non-integrated, then the orbital implant remains separate from the rest of the orbit's tissue.
The review authors looked to see if the type of implant material affected the success of the surgery or, in other words, if integrated implants can provide better results than non-integrated implants. They were also interested in how much the external prosthesis could move better after surgery - using integrated or non-integrated orbital implants. Also, the authors wanted to know if the type of orbital implant material can affect people's quality of life. Were there any adverse (harmful) effects of using integrated or non-integrated orbital implants?
The type of material used for the orbital implant may not affect the success of the surgery (low-certainty evidence). The review authors judged the evidence on prosthesis movement and adverse effects as providing very little certainty about the true effects. There was no information on quality of life.

5ba849b3a2a1ae0001f08d2d,static_1,Helicobacter pylori treatment for the prevention of stomach cancer,"Gastric cancer is the third most common cause of cancer death worldwide. Individuals infected with Helicobacter pylori have a higher likelihood of developing gastric cancer than individuals who are not infected. Eradication of H. pylori in healthy asymptomatic individuals in the general population may reduce the incidence of gastric cancer, but the magnitude of this effect is unclear.
To assess the effectiveness of eradication of H. pylori in healthy asymptomatic individuals in the general population in reducing the incidence of gastric cancer.
We identified trials by searching the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2020, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1946 to February 2020), and EMBASE (1974 to February 2020). We handsearched reference lists from trials selected by electronic searching to identify further relevant trials. We handsearched published abstracts from conference proceedings from the United European Gastroenterology Week (published in Gut) and Digestive Disease Week (published in Gastroenterology) between 2001 and 2019. We contacted members of the Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Diseases Review Group and experts in the field and asked them to provide details of outstanding clinical trials and any relevant unpublished materials.
We analysed randomised controlled trials comparing at least one week of H. pylori therapy with placebo or no treatment in preventing subsequent development of gastric cancer in otherwise healthy and asymptomatic H. pylori-positive adults. Trials had to follow up participants for at least two years and needed to have at least two participants with gastric cancer as an outcome. We defined gastric cancer as any gastric adenocarcinoma, including intestinal (differentiated) or diffuse (undifferentiated) type, with or without specified histology.
We collected data on incidence of gastric cancer, incidence of oesophageal cancer, deaths from gastric cancer, deaths from any cause, and adverse effects arising due to therapy.
Six trials met all our eligibility criteria and provided extractable data in the previous version. Following our updated search, one new RCT was identified, meaning that seven trials were included in this updated review. In addition, one previously included trial provided fully published data out to 10 years, and another previously included trial provided fully published data out to 22 years of follow-up. Four trials were at low risk of bias, one trial was at unclear risk, and two trials were at high risk of bias. Six trials were conducted in Asian populations. In preventing development of subsequent gastric cancer, H. pylori eradication therapy was superior to placebo or no treatment (RR 0.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 0.72, 7 trials, 8323 participants, moderate certainty evidence). Only two trials reported the effect of eradication of H. pylori on the development of subsequent oesophageal cancer. Sixteen (0.8%) of 1947 participants assigned to eradication therapy subsequently developed oesophageal cancer compared with 13 (0.7%) of 1941 participants allocated to placebo (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.59 to 2.54, moderate certainty evidence). H. pylori eradication reduced mortality from gastric cancer compared with placebo or no treatment (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.92, 4 trials, 6301 participants, moderate certainty evidence). There was little or no evidence in all-cause mortality (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.12, 5 trials, 7079 participants, moderate certainty evidence). Adverse events data were poorly reported.
We found moderate certainty evidence that searching for and eradicating H. pylori reduces the incidence of gastric cancer and death from gastric cancer in healthy asymptomatic infected Asian individuals, but we cannot necessarily extrapolate this data to other populations.","Whether testing healthy people for Helicobacter pylori and treating those infected with a course of antibiotics decreases the number of new cases of gastric cancer. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a bacteria that lives in the lining of the stomach with people usually not aware they are carrying the infection. People with H. pylori infection are more likely to develop gastric cancer than people who are not infected with the bacterium. For this reason, H. pylori is classed as carcinogenic (causing cancer) to humans. Many people worldwide die of gastric cancer every year, because by the time those affected seek the opinion of a doctor, the condition is often advanced. However, H. pylori infection is easily treatable with a one-week course of antibiotics. A literature search up to 02 Feburary 2020 found seven trials (containing 8323 participants, four trials at low risk of bias). Six of the studies were based in Asia. We found that antibiotics for H. pylori have a small benefit in preventing gastric cancer (68 (1.6%) of 4206 participants given treatment developed gastric cancer subsequently, compared with 125 (3.0%) of 4117 given no treatment or a placebo), and in decreasing the number of deaths from gastric cancer (36 (1.1%) of 3154, compared with 59 (1.9%) of 3147); but it is unclear whether or not they increase or decrease the number of deaths due to any cause, or increase or decrease the number of cases of oesophageal cancer. Data about side effects of treatment were poorly reported. Four trials were at low risk of bias, one trial was at unclear risk, and two trials were at high risk of bias. One study was at high risk of bias because no placebo was used for the active eradication therapy regimen, and so this part of the trial was unblinded, and the other study was at high risk of bias due to inconsistencies in data reporting at the two points of follow-up. We were unable to resolve this discrepancy despite contacting the original authors. As a result, we downgraded the quality of evidence from high to moderate due to serious risk of bias.",1030,H. pylori eradication therapy; Helicobacter pylori; gastric adenocarcinoma; asymptomatic individuals; incidence of gastric cancer; oesophageal cancer; placebo; mortality from gastric cancer; adverse effects,What reasoning might explain the moderate certainty evidence regarding H. pylori eradication reducing gastric cancer incidence in the study population?,"Considering the study's findings, what might be deduced about the potential reduction in gastric cancer mortality through H. pylori eradication?",Select all of the following that are colors,What bacterium is associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer?,"In the context of the study, describe the reported benefit of using antibiotics for H. pylori.",The trials had varying levels of bias affecting the outcomes.; The population sample size was too small for adequate analysis.; The intervention period was shorter than necessary to observe long-term effects.,The trials had varying levels of bias affecting the outcomes.,Gastric cancer mortality can be significantly reduced with eradication efforts.; Gastric cancer mortality rates are unaffected by H. pylori treatment.; Mortality reduction is specific to the Asian population studied.,Gastric cancer mortality can be significantly reduced with eradication efforts.; Mortality reduction is specific to the Asian population studied.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Helicobacter pylori; Escherichia coli; Staphylococcus aureus,Helicobacter pylori,Decreases the incidence of gastric cancer; Increases overall life expectancy; Eliminates all types of cancer,Decreases the incidence of gastric cancer
5ba849b3a2a1ae0001f08d2d,static_2,"Pharmacological, non-invasive brain stimulation and psychological interventions for treating depression after stroke","Depression is an important morbidity associated with stroke that impacts on recovery, yet is often undetected or inadequately treated. This review aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of pharmacological intervention, non-invasive brain stimulation, psychological therapy, or combinations of these to treat depression after stroke. This is a living systematic review, and we search for new evidence every two months and update the review when we identify relevant new evidence; we searched the Specialised Registers of Cochrane Stroke and Cochrane Depression Anxiety and Neurosis, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, five other databases, two clinical trials registers, reference lists and conference proceedings (February 2022), and contacted study authors. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were eligible if they compared pharmacological interventions with placebo; non-invasive brain stimulation with sham stimulation or usual care; psychological therapy with usual care or attention control; pharmacological intervention and psychological therapy with pharmacological intervention and usual care or attention control; pharmacological intervention and non-invasive brain stimulation with pharmacological intervention and sham stimulation or usual care; non-invasive brain stimulation and psychological therapy versus sham brain stimulation or usual care and psychological therapy; pharmacological intervention and psychological therapy with placebo and psychological therapy; pharmacological intervention and non-invasive brain stimulation with placebo and non-invasive brain stimulation; and non-invasive brain stimulation and psychological therapy versus non-invasive brain stimulation and usual care or attention control, with the intention of treating depression after stroke. Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data; we calculated mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous data and risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous data with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), assessed heterogeneity using the I² statistic, and evaluated certainty of evidence according to GRADE. We included 65 trials (72 comparisons) with 5831 participants, with data available for 20 comparisons involving pharmacological interventions, nine for non-invasive brain stimulation, 25 for psychological therapy, three for pharmacological plus psychological therapy, 14 for pharmacological plus non-invasive brain stimulation, and one for non-invasive brain stimulation plus psychological therapy, and no trials for three other comparisons. For pharmacological interventions, very low-certainty evidence from eight trials suggests decreased numbers of people meeting study criteria for depression (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.88; 8 RCTs; 1025 participants) and decreased inadequate response to treatment (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.70; 6 RCTs; 511 participants) compared to placebo, but more adverse events related to the CNS (RR 1.55, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.15; 5 RCTs; 488 participants) and gastrointestinal system (RR 1.62, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.19; 4 RCTs; 473 participants) occurred with pharmacological intervention. For non-invasive brain stimulation, very low-certainty evidence from two trials showed little to no effect on depression or inadequate treatment response compared to sham stimulation. For psychological therapy, very low-certainty evidence from six trials suggests decreased depression prevalence (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.95; 521 participants) compared to usual care/attention control, with no differences in deaths or adverse events. For combined pharmacological and psychological therapy, no trials reported primary outcomes. For pharmacological intervention plus non-invasive brain stimulation, combination therapy reduced depression prevalence (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.91; 3 RCTs; 392 participants; low-certainty evidence) but did not reduce inadequate treatment response (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.30; 3 RCTs; 392 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and very low-certainty evidence from five trials suggested no difference in deaths. No primary outcomes were reported for non-invasive brain stimulation plus psychological therapy. Overall, very low-certainty evidence suggests that pharmacological, psychological, and combination therapies can reduce the prevalence of depression after stroke, while non-invasive brain stimulation has little to no effect, and pharmacological interventions were associated with CNS and gastrointestinal adverse events; more research is required before routine use of such treatments can be recommended.","Do pharmacological treatments, non-invasive brain stimulation (electrodes are placed on the scalp and a finely controlled electric current is applied to change brain activity), psychological treatments, or combination treatments reduce the proportion of people with depression or the extent of depressive symptoms after stroke? Depression is common after stroke yet often is not detected or is inadequately treated. We identified studies by searches conducted on 8 February 2022. This is a living systematic review. We search for new evidence every two months and update the review when we identify relevant new evidence. Please refer to the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for the current status of this review. We included trials that reported on the use of pharmacological, non-invasive brain stimulation, psychological, and combined interventions to treat depression after stroke. We described the main outcomes as the number of people meeting the criteria for depression (scoring above a predefined scoring threshold) and inadequate response (scoring below 50% of the predefined scoring threshold). Average age of participants ranged from 54 to 78 years. Studies were from Asia (39), Europe (12), America (6), South America (1) and Australia (3). We included 65 trials (72 comparisons) involving 5831 participants. Pharmacological treatments resulted in fewer people meeting the study criteria for depression at end of treatment and with inadequate response to treatment. Non-invasive brain stimulation did not reduce the number of people meeting the study criteria for depression at end of treatment and with inadequate response to treatment. Psychological therapy reduced the number of people meeting the study criteria for depression at end of treatment. The combination of pharmacological treatment and non-invasive brain stimulation resulted in fewer people meeting the study criteria for depression but did not affect those with inadequate response to treatment. More people in the pharmacological treatment group reported central nervous system (e.g. confusion, sedation, tremor; in five trials) and gastrointestinal side effects (e.g. constipation, diarrhoea; in four trials) than in the placebo groups. Information on side effects of other treatments was not provided. Estimates of treatment effects were imprecise due to small numbers in most studies and recruitment of people with very different baseline characteristics. We rated the certainty of evidence as low to very low due to these and other limitations in study design. Antidepressant drugs may benefit people with persistent depressive symptoms after stroke, but care is required in their use, as little is known about their effects on overall stroke recovery.

To assess the effects of AGI in people with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), impaired fasting blood glucose (IFG), moderately elevated glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) or any combination of these.
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and the reference lists of systematic reviews, articles and health technology assessment reports. The date of the last search of all databases was December 2017.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), with a duration of one year or more, comparing AGI with any pharmacological glucose-lowering intervention, behaviour-changing intervention, placebo or no intervention in people with IFG, IGT, moderately elevated HbA1c or combinations of these.
Two review authors read all abstracts and full-text articles or records, assessed quality and extracted outcome data independently. One review author extracted data, which were checked by a second review author. We resolved discrepancies by consensus or involvement of a third review author. For meta-analyses we used a random-effects model with assessment of risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes, using 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for effect estimates. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence by using the GRADE instrument.
For this update of the Cochrane Review (first published 2006, Issue 4) we included 10 RCTs (11,814 participants), eight investigating acarbose and two investigating voglibose, that included people with IGT or people ""at increased risk for diabetes"". The trial duration ranged from one to six years. Most trials compared AGI with placebo (N = 4) or no intervention (N = 4). Acarbose reduced the incidence of T2DM compared to placebo: 670 out of 4014 people (16.7%) in the acarbose groups developed T2DM, compared to 812 out of 3994 people (20.3%) in the placebo groups (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.89; P < 0.0001; 3 trials; 8008 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). One trial including participants with coronary heart disease and IGT contributed 64% of cases for this outcome. Acarbose reduced the risk of T2DM compared to no intervention: 7 out 75 people (9.3%) in the acarbose groups developed T2DM, compared to 18 out of 65 people (27.7%) in the no-intervention groups (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.69; P = 0.004; 2 trials; 140 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Acarbose compared to placebo did not reduce or increase the risk of all-cause mortality (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.18; P = 0.86; 3 trials; 8069 participants; very low-certainty evidence), cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.71 to 1.10; P = 0.26; 3 trials; 8069 participants; very low-certainty evidence), serious adverse events (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.29; P = 0.13; 2 trials; 6625 participants; low-certainty evidence), non-fatal stroke (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.74; P = 0.43; 1 trial; 1368 participants; very low-certainty evidence) or congestive heart failure (RR of 0.87; 95% CI 0.63 to 1.12; P = 0.40; 2 trials; 7890 participants; low-certainty evidence). Acarbose compared to placebo reduced non-fatal myocardial infarction: one out of 742 participants (0.1%) in the acarbose groups had a non-fatal myocardial infarction compared to 15 out of 744 participants (2%) in the placebo groups (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.53; P = 0.007; 2 trials; 1486 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Acarbose treatment showed an increased risk of non-serious adverse events (mainly gastro-intestinal events), compared to placebo: 751 of 775 people (96.9%) in the acarbose groups experienced an event, compared to 723 of 775 people (93.3%) in the placebo groups (RR 1.04; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.06; P = 0.0008; 2 trials; 1550 participants). Acarbose compared to no intervention showed no advantage or disadvantage for any of these outcome measures (very low-certainty evidence). One trial each compared voglibose with placebo (1780 participants) or diet and exercise (870 participants). Voglibose compared to placebo reduced the incidence of T2DM: 50 out of 897 participants (5.6%) developed T2DM, compared to 106 out of 881 participants (12%) in the placebo group (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.64; P < 0.0001; 1 trial; 1778 participants; low-certainty evidence). For all other reported outcome measures there were no clear differences between voglibose and comparator groups. One trial with 90 participants compared acarbose with diet and exercise and another trial with 98 participants reported data on acarbose versus metformin. There were no clear differences for any outcome measure between these two acarbose interventions and the associated comparator groups. None of the trials reported amputation of lower extremity, blindness or severe vision loss, end-stage renal disease, health-related quality of life, time to progression to T2DM, or socioeconomic effects.
AGI may prevent or delay the development of T2DM in people with IGT. There is no firm evidence that AGI have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular mortality or cardiovascular events.","People with moderately elevated glucose levels are often said to be at an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Therefore, these people are frequently recommended to increase exercise and lower calorie intake to prevent type 2 diabetes. Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (acarbose, miglitol, voglibose) are used to lower blood glucose in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is currently not known whether alpha-glucosidase inhibitors should be prescribed for people with moderately raised blood glucose levels. We wanted to find out whether alpha-glucosidase inhibitors could prevent or delay type 2 diabetes mellitus in people with moderately elevated glucose levels. We searched medical literature for randomised controlled trials of at least one year's duration investigating alpha-glucosidase inhibitors in participants with glucose levels higher than considered normal but below the diagnostic criteria for type 2 diabetes mellitus. We found 10 randomised controlled trials representing 11,814 participants: eight investigating acarbose and two investigating voglibose. The trial duration ranged from one to six years. When comparing acarbose with placebo, 670 out of 4014 participants (17%) receiving acarbose developed type 2 diabetes compared to 812 out of 3994 participants (20%) receiving placebo. Most data for this comparison came from a trial including people with heart disease. When comparing acarbose with no intervention, seven out of 75 participants (9%) receiving acarbose developed type 2 diabetes compared to 18 out of 65 participants (28%) receiving no intervention. Acarbose treatment did not reduce or increase the risk of death from any cause, death from heart disease, serious side effects, strokes or heart failure. Compared to placebo, acarbose reduced the risk for heart attacks: one out of 742 participants (0.1%) receiving acarbose had a heart attack compared to 15 out of 744 participants (2%) receiving placebo. Acarbose treatment showed an increased risk of non-serious side effects (mainly gastrointestinal events): 751 of 775 people (97%) receiving acarbose had a non-serious side effect compared to 723 of 775 people (93%) receiving placebo. One trial compared voglibose with placebo and another compared voglibose with diet and exercise. When comparing voglibose with placebo, 50 out of 897 participants (5.6%) receiving voglibose developed type 2 diabetes compared to 106 out of 881 participants (12%) receiving placebo. One trial with 90 participants compared acarbose with diet and exercise and another with 98 participants compared acarbose with metformin; there were no important differences for any outcome. None of the trials reported amputation of lower limbs, blindness or severe vision loss, kidney disease, health-related quality of life, time to progression to type 2 diabetes mellitus, or socioeconomic effects such as absence from work or costs. For most of our outcomes we are uncertain or very uncertain how valid the results are. Reasons for this uncertainty include systematic errors in some trials, the low number of trials for several outcomes, imprecise results, and missing data from one included trial.",1012,Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors; type 2 diabetes mellitus; impaired glucose tolerance; impaired fasting blood glucose; glycosylated haemoglobin A1c; acarbose; voglibose; all-cause mortality; non-fatal myocardial infarction; non-serious adverse events,What is the primary goal of using alpha-glucosidase inhibitors in people with moderately elevated glucose levels?,Which alpha-glucosidase inhibitors were investigated in the study?,Select all of the following that are colors,How many randomised controlled trials were included in the study?,Which group showed a lower incidence of type 2 diabetes when comparing acarbose with placebo?,To prevent or delay type 2 diabetes mellitus; To increase physical exercise levels; To reduce calorie intake,To prevent or delay type 2 diabetes mellitus,Acarbose and voglibose; Metformin and voglibose; Miglitol and acarbose,Acarbose and voglibose,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,10 trials; 6 trials; 12 trials,10 trials,Acarbose group; Placebo group; Control group,Acarbose group
5ba849b3a2a1ae0001f08d2d,interactive_3,Green tea for the prevention of cancer,"This review is an update of a previously published review in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009, Issue 3).Tea is one of the most commonly consumed beverages worldwide. Teas from the plant Camellia sinensis can be grouped into green, black and oolong tea, and drinking habits vary cross-culturally. C sinensis contains polyphenols, one subgroup being catechins. Catechins are powerful antioxidants, and laboratory studies have suggested that these compounds may inhibit cancer cell proliferation. Some experimental and nonexperimental epidemiological studies have suggested that green tea may have cancer-preventative effects.
To assess possible associations between green tea consumption and the risk of cancer incidence and mortality as primary outcomes, and safety data and quality of life as secondary outcomes.
We searched eligible studies up to January 2019 in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and reference lists of previous reviews and included studies.
We included all epidemiological studies, experimental (i.e. randomised controlled trials (RCTs)) and nonexperimental (non-randomised studies, i.e. observational studies with both cohort and case-control design) that investigated the association of green tea consumption with cancer risk or quality of life, or both.
Two or more review authors independently applied the study criteria, extracted data and assessed methodological quality of studies. We summarised the results according to diagnosis of cancer type.
In this review update, we included in total 142 completed studies (11 experimental and 131 nonexperimental) and two ongoing studies. This is an additional 10 experimental and 85 nonexperimental studies from those included in the previous version of the review. Eleven experimental studies allocated a total of 1795 participants to either green tea extract or placebo, all demonstrating an overall high methodological quality based on 'Risk of bias' assessment. For incident prostate cancer, the summary risk ratio (RR) in the green tea-supplemented participants was 0.50 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 1.36), based on three studies and involving 201 participants (low-certainty evidence). The summary RR for gynaecological cancer was 1.50 (95% CI 0.41 to 5.48; 2 studies, 1157 participants; low-certainty evidence). No evidence of effect of non-melanoma skin cancer emerged (summary RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.92; 1 study, 1075 participants; low-certainty evidence). In addition, adverse effects of green tea extract intake were reported, including gastrointestinal disorders, elevation of liver enzymes, and, more rarely, insomnia, raised blood pressure and skin/subcutaneous reactions. Consumption of green tea extracts induced a slight improvement in quality of life, compared with placebo, based on three experimental studies. In nonexperimental studies, we included over 1,100,000 participants from 46 cohort studies and 85 case-control studies, which were on average of intermediate to high methodological quality based on Newcastle-Ottawa Scale 'Risk of bias' assessment. When comparing the highest intake of green tea with the lowest, we found a lower overall cancer incidence (summary RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.07), based on three studies, involving 52,479 participants (low-certainty evidence). Conversely, we found no association between green tea consumption and cancer-related mortality (summary RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.07), based on eight studies and 504,366 participants (low-certainty evidence). For most of the site-specific cancers we observed a decreased RR in the highest category of green tea consumption compared with the lowest one. After stratifying the analysis according to study design, we found strongly conflicting results for some cancer sites: oesophageal, prostate and urinary tract cancer, and leukaemia showed an increased RR in cohort studies and a decreased RR or no difference in case-control studies.
Overall, findings from experimental and nonexperimental epidemiological studies yielded inconsistent results, thus providing limited evidence for the beneficial effect of green tea consumption on the overall risk of cancer or on specific cancer sites. Some evidence of a beneficial effect of green tea at some cancer sites emerged from the RCTs and from case-control studies, but their methodological limitations, such as the low number and size of the studies, and the inconsistencies with the results of cohort studies, limit the interpretability of the RR estimates. The studies also indicated the occurrence of several side effects associated with high intakes of green tea. In addition, the majority of included studies were carried out in Asian populations characterised by a high intake of green tea, thus limiting the generalisability of the findings to other populations. Well conducted and adequately powered RCTs would be needed to draw conclusions on the possible beneficial effects of green tea consumption on cancer risk.","There is a high consumption worldwide of green tea (Camellia sinensis), that contains polyphenols which have a powerful antioxidant activity that can prevent the formation of free radicals that may cause damage and cell death. Therefore it has been suggested that green tea might reduce cancer risk, a theory that has been tested through a number of studies on human populations, which examined the link between green tea consumption and cancer. We assessed the association between green tea consumption and the risk of developing cancer in epidemiologic studies. In this review we included 142 studies with more than 1.1 million participants looking for an association between green tea consumption and cancers of the digestive tract and the female reproductive system, breast, prostate, kidney and urinary tract, nasopharynx, lung, blood, skin, thyroid and brain. The majority of the studies were of medium to high quality in terms of how they were conducted. Overall, the evidence from the studies showed that the consumption of green tea to reduce the risk of cancer was inconsistent. Some studies suggested a beneficial effect on cancer risk, while others indicated no effect, and even suggested a slightly increased cancer risk. In particular, results from experimental studies suggested that green tea extract supplementation yielded a decreased risk for prostate cancer, but increased risk for gynaecological cancers. For non-melanoma skin cancer no difference in cancer cases emerged. Green tea supplementation seemed to slightly improve quality of life compared with placebo, although it was associated with some adverse effects including gastrointestinal disorders, higher levels of liver enzymes, and, more rarely, insomnia, raised blood pressure and skin reactions. In nonexperimental studies, comparing people consuming the highest amount of green tea to those in the lowest category of consumption, we found an indication of a lower occurrence of new cases of overall types of cancer, while no difference emerged for lethal cases. However, results according to the type of cancer and study design were inconsistent. A beneficial effect of green tea consumption on cancer prevention remains unproven so far.

5ba849b3a2a1ae0001f08d2d,interactive_4,Rivastigmine for people with Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer's disease is the commonest cause of dementia affecting older people. One of the therapeutic strategies aimed at ameliorating the clinical manifestations of Alzheimer's disease is to enhance cholinergic neurotransmission in the brain by the use of cholinesterase inhibitors to delay the breakdown of acetylcholine released into synaptic clefts. Tacrine, the first of the cholinesterase inhibitors to undergo extensive trials for this purpose, was associated with significant adverse effects including hepatotoxicity. Other cholinesterase inhibitors, including rivastigmine, with superior properties in terms of specificity of action and lower risk of adverse effects have since been introduced. Rivastigmine has received approval for use in 60 countries including all member states of the European Union and the USA. To determine the clinical efficacy and safety of rivastigmine for patients with dementia of Alzheimer's type. We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialized Register, on 2 March 2015 using the terms: Rivastigmine OR exelon OR ENA OR ""SDZ ENA 713"". ALOIS contains records of clinical trials identified from monthly searches of a number of major healthcare databases (Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS), numerous trial registries and grey literature sources. We included all unconfounded, double-blind, randomised, controlled trials in which treatment with rivastigmine was administered to patients with dementia of the Alzheimer's type for 12 weeks or more and its effects compared with those of placebo in a parallel group of patients, or where two formulations of rivastigmine were compared. One review author (JSB) applied the study selection criteria, assessed the quality of studies and extracted data. A total of 13 trials met the inclusion criteria of the review. The trials had a duration of between 12 and 52 weeks. The older trials tested a capsule form with a dose of up to 12 mg/day. Trials reported since 2007 have tested continuous dose transdermal patch formulations delivering 4.6, 9.5 and 17.7 mg/day. Our main analysis compared the safety and efficacy of rivastigmine 6 to 12 mg/day orally or 9.5 mg/day transdermally with placebo. Seven trials contributed data from 3450 patients to this analysis. Data from another two studies were not included because of a lack of information and methodological concerns. All the included trials were multicentre trials and recruited patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease with a mean age of about 75 years. All had low risk of bias for randomisation and allocation but the risk of bias due to attrition was unclear in four studies, low in one study and high in two studies. After 26 weeks of treatment rivastigmine compared to placebo was associated with better outcomes for cognitive function measured with the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-Cog) score (mean difference (MD) -1.79; 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.21 to -1.37, n = 3232, 6 studies) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score (MD 0.74; 95% CI 0.52 to 0.97, n = 3205, 6 studies), activities of daily living (SMD 0.20; 95% CI 0.13 to 0.27, n = 3230, 6 studies) and clinician rated global impression of changes, with a smaller proportion of patients treated with rivastigmine experiencing no change or a deterioration (OR 0.68; 95% CI 0.58 to 0.80, n = 3338, 7 studies). Three studies reported behavioural change, and there were no differences compared to placebo (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.04; 95% CI -0.14 to 0.06, n = 1529, 3 studies). Only one study measured the impact on caregivers using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Caregiver Distress (NPI-D) scale and this found no difference between the groups (MD 0.10; 95% CI -0.91 to 1.11, n = 529, 1 study). Overall, participants who received rivastigmine were about twice as likely to withdraw from the trials (odds ratio (OR) 2.01, 95% CI 1.71 to 2.37, n = 3569, 7 studies) or to experience an adverse event during the trials (OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.82 to 2.57, n = 3587, 7 studies). Rivastigmine (6 to 12 mg daily orally or 9.5 mg daily transdermally) appears to be beneficial for people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. In comparisons with placebo, better outcomes were observed for rate of decline of cognitive function and activities of daily living, although the effects were small and of uncertain clinical importance. There was also a benefit from rivastigmine on the outcome of clinician's global assessment. There were no differences between the rivastigmine group and placebo group in behavioural change or impact on carers. At these doses the transdermal patch may have fewer side effects than the capsules but has comparable efficacy. The quality of evidence is only moderate for all of the outcomes reviewed because of a risk of bias due to dropouts. ","Alzheimer's disease is the commonest cause of dementia affecting older people. As the disease progresses, people lose the ability to remember, communicate, think clearly and perform the usual daily activities. Their behaviour or personality may also change. In severe Alzheimer's disease, the patients lose the ability to care for themselves and require full time care. Currently, there is no cure available for Alzheimer's disease, but a few pharmacological interventions are available to alleviate symptoms. The symptoms are caused by the loss of a type of nerve cell in the brain called cholinergic neurons. Rivastigmine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, works by increasing the levels of a brain chemical called acetylcholine which allows the nerve cells to communicate. This may improve the symptoms of dementia. Rivastigmine can be taken orally, either as capsules or a liquid, or by applying a patch on the skin. Its effectiveness in improving the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and safety were evaluated in this review.This review included double-blinded randomised controlled trials, and the evidence was searched for up to March 2015 using the standard Cochrane methods. The review included studies conducted for at least 12 weeks that compared the safety and effectiveness of rivastigmine compared with placebo. Thirteen studies that met these criteria were found. Most of these studies involved people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease with an average age of around 75 years. The quality of the evidence for most of the outcomes reviewed was moderate. The main factors affecting our confidence in the results included relatively high number of patients dropping out in some of the trials (the rates of dropout in the rivastigmine arms were higher). There were also concerns about the applicability of the evidence for the long term treatment of Alzheimer's disease since data from double-blinded randomised controlled trials were only available for up to 12 months. All the data included in the main analysis of this review came from studies either sponsored or funded by the drug manufacturer (Novartis Pharma).",1128,Alzheimer's disease; cholinergic neurotransmission; cholinesterase inhibitors; acetylcholine; hepatotoxicity; rivastigmine; transdermal patch; activities of daily living; attrition,"In terms of study design, how could future investigations improve upon the current evidence regarding rivastigmine?",What conclusions can be drawn about the benefits of rivastigmine in terms of patient behavior?,Select all of the following that are colors,What is the main purpose of using rivastigmine in Alzheimer's disease?,Summarize the main findings regarding the efficacy of rivastigmine.,Include more diverse patient populations for broader applicability.; Focus solely on short-term effects to enhance result precision.; Implement measures to reduce dropout rates.,Include more diverse patient populations for broader applicability.; Implement measures to reduce dropout rates.,Rivastigmine leads to significant improvements in behavior compared to placebo.; There are no observable differences between rivastigmine and placebo in behavioral changes.; Behavioral improvements are the primary benefit of rivastigmine.,There are no observable differences between rivastigmine and placebo in behavioral changes.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,To cure Alzheimer's disease; To alleviate symptoms of dementia; To increase the production of neurons,To alleviate symptoms of dementia,Rivastigmine significantly improved cognitive functions.; Rivastigmine halted the progression of Alzheimer's.; Rivastigmine showed no differences compared to placebo.,Rivastigmine significantly improved cognitive functions.
5ba849b3a2a1ae0001f08d2d,interactive_4,Exercise training for bronchiectasis,"Bronchiectasis is characterised by excessive sputum production, chronic cough, and acute exacerbations and is associated with symptoms of dyspnoea and fatigue, which reduce exercise tolerance and impair quality of life. Exercise training in isolation or in conjunction with other interventions is beneficial for people with other respiratory diseases, but its effects in bronchiectasis have not been well established.
To determine effects of exercise training compared to usual care on exercise tolerance (primary outcome), quality of life (primary outcome), incidence of acute exacerbation and hospitalisation, respiratory and mental health symptoms, physical function, mortality, and adverse events in people with stable or acute exacerbation of bronchiectasis.
We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Specialised Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization trials portal, from their inception to October 2020. We reviewed respiratory conference abstracts and reference lists of all primary studies and review articles for additional references.
We included randomised controlled trials in which exercise training of at least four weeks' duration (or eight sessions) was compared to usual care for people with stable bronchiectasis or experiencing an acute exacerbation. Co-interventions with exercise training including education, respiratory muscle training, and airway clearance therapy were permitted if also applied as part of usual care.
Two review authors independently screened and selected trials for inclusion, extracted outcome data, and assessed risk of bias. We contacted study authors for missing data. We calculated mean differences (MDs) using a random-effects model. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence.
We included six studies, two of which were published as abstracts, with a total of 275 participants. Five studies were undertaken with people with clinically stable bronchiectasis, and one pilot study was undertaken post acute exacerbation. All studies included co-interventions such as instructions for airway clearance therapy and/or breathing strategies, provision of an educational booklet, and delivery of educational sessions. The duration of training ranged from six to eight weeks, with a mix of supervised and unsupervised sessions conducted in the outpatient or home setting. No studies of children were included in the review; however we identified two studies as currently ongoing. No data were available regarding physical activity levels or adverse events. For people with stable bronchiectasis, evidence suggests that exercise training compared to usual care improves functional exercise tolerance as measured by the incremental shuttle walk distance, with a mean difference (MD) between groups of 87 metres (95% confidence interval (CI) 43 to 132 metres; 4 studies, 161 participants; low-certainty evidence). Evidence also suggests that exercise training improves six-minute walk distance (6MWD) (MD between groups of 42 metres, 95% CI 22 to 62; 1 study, 76 participants; low-certainty evidence). The magnitude of these observed mean changes appears clinically relevant as they exceed minimal clinically important difference (MCID) thresholds for people with chronic lung disease. Evidence suggests that quality of life improves following exercise training according to St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score (MD -9.62 points, 95% CI -15.67 to -3.56 points; 3 studies, 160 participants; low-certainty evidence), which exceeds the MCID of 4 points for this outcome. A reduction in dyspnoea (MD 1.0 points, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.53; 1 study, 76 participants) and fatigue (MD 1.51 points, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.22 points; 1 study, 76 participants) was observed following exercise training according to these domains of the Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire. However, there was no change in cough-related quality of life as measured by the Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ) (MD -0.09 points, 95% CI -0.98 to 0.80 points; 2 studies, 103 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), nor in anxiety or depression. Two studies reported longer-term outcomes up to 12 months after intervention completion; however exercise training did not appear to improve exercise capacity or quality of life more than usual care. Exercise training reduced the number of acute exacerbations of bronchiectasis over 12 months in people with stable bronchiectasis (odds ratio 0.26, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.81; 1 study, 55 participants). After an acute exacerbation of bronchiectasis, data from a single study (N = 27) suggest that exercise training compared to usual care confers little to no effect on exercise capacity (MD 11 metres, 95% CI -27 to 49 metres; low-certainty evidence), SGRQ total score (MD 6.34 points, 95%CI -17.08 to 29.76 points), or LCQ score (MD -0.08 points, 95% CI -0.94 to 0.78 points; low-certainty evidence) and does not reduce the time to first exacerbation (hazard ratio 0.83, 95% CI 0.31 to 2.22).
This review provides low-certainty evidence suggesting improvement in functional exercise capacity and quality of life immediately following exercise training in people with stable bronchiectasis; however the effects of exercise training on cough-related quality of life and psychological symptoms appear to be minimal. Due to inadequate reporting of methods, small study numbers, and variation between study findings, evidence is of very low to moderate certainty. Limited evidence is available to show longer-term effects of exercise training on these outcomes.","We wanted to know whether exercise training improves exercise tolerance, quality of life, or symptoms, and whether it reduces the number of future flare-ups (exacerbations) in people with bronchiectasis compared to those who did not participate in exercise training. We examined studies involving people with stable disease as well as those recovering from a recent flare-up, aiming to include evidence for both children and adults, although no studies involving children were found. Bronchiectasis causes chronic cough and sputum production, and people with this condition have an increased risk of exacerbations that worsen exercise tolerance and quality of life. While exercise training benefits people with other chronic lung conditions, its effects in bronchiectasis are less well understood. The evidence is current up to October 2020 and includes six studies with 275 participants, five of which involved people with stable disease. Exercise training was delivered alongside other treatments such as airway clearance therapy, respiratory muscle training, and education. Participants were randomly assigned to either exercise training or no exercise training. Training lasted at least six weeks and took place either in group settings or at home. None of the studies were funded by commercial companies. After completing exercise training, participants in a stable condition walked farther than those who did not train, with an average increase of 87 meters, although certainty of evidence is low. Participants also reported improved quality of life, less shortness of breath, and reduced fatigue. Moderate-certainty evidence showed that exercise training might not specifically improve cough-related symptoms, but the incidence of acute exacerbations was lower. Evidence was insufficient to determine whether the benefits lasted beyond the training period or whether exercise training increased overall physical activity. No benefits were observed for people who began exercise training soon after an acute flare-up. The certainty of evidence ranged from very low to moderate due to uncertainty in effect size, limitations in study design, and insufficient data. More studies with larger sample sizes are needed to understand the long-term effects of exercise training in people with bronchiectasis regardless of their clinical stability.",1074,Bronchiectasis; sputum production; dyspnoea; exercise tolerance; acute exacerbations; Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire; Leicester Cough Questionnaire; airway clearance therapy; co-interventions; minimal clinically important difference,What conclusions can be drawn about the impact of exercise training on the quality of life in bronchiectasis patients according to the summary?,"Based on the summary, what challenges remain unresolved for exercise training in bronchiectasis?",Select all of the following that are fruits,What was the primary objective of the study?,Describe the effect of exercise training on exercise tolerance in stable bronchiectasis patients.,Exercise training significantly improves the quality of life for stable bronchiectasis patients.; The improvement in quality of life is indefinite and requires further study.; Exercise training did not improve the quality of life at all.,Exercise training significantly improves the quality of life for stable bronchiectasis patients.; The improvement in quality of life is indefinite and requires further study.,Long-term benefits beyond the training period.; Initial high cost of exercise programs.; Effectiveness for people after acute flare-ups.,Long-term benefits beyond the training period.; Effectiveness for people after acute flare-ups.,dog; blue; grape,grape,To determine the effects of exercise training in people with bronchiectasis; To analyze the dietary habits of bronchiectasis patients; To evaluate the economic impact of bronchiectasis,To determine the effects of exercise training in people with bronchiectasis,Increases exercise tolerance; Decreases exercise tolerance; No effect on exercise tolerance,Increases exercise tolerance
5ba849b3a2a1ae0001f08d2d,finetuned_5,Use of medication to treat depression in people with opioid dependence,"Lifetime prevalence of depression in subjects with opioid dependence is higher than in the general population (44-54% versus 16%) and represents a risk factor for morbidity and mortality. For patients on opioid agonist treatment, current prevalence rates of depression ranges between 10 and 30%, influencing negatively the outcome of the treatment. To evaluate the efficacy and the acceptability of antidepressants for the treatment of depressed opioid dependents treated with opioid agonists. We searched Pubmed, EMBASE, CINAHL (to October 2009), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library Cochrane Drug and Alcohol Group Specialised Register, issue 4, 2009), main electronic sources of ongoing trials, specific trial databases and reference lists of all relevant papers. Randomised and controlled clinical trials examining the efficacy of any antidepressant medication to treat depressed opioid dependents in treatment with opioid agonists. Two authors independently screened and extracted data from studies. Seven studies, 482 participants, met the inclusion criteria.  Comparing antidepressant with placebo, no statistically significant results for dropouts. Selecting studies with low risk of bias, 325 participants, results favour placebo, RR 1.40 (Cl 95% 1.00 to 1.96). For severity of depression, results from two studies, 183 participants, favour antidepressants utilising Clinical Global Impression Scale RR 1.92 (CI 95% 1.26 to 2.94), while another study, 95 participants, utilising the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, did not find a statistically significant difference RR 0.96 (CI 95% 0.54 to 1.71). For adverse events, result favour placebo, four studies, 311 participants, RR 2.90 (Cl 95% 1.23 to 6.86). For drug use, three studies, 211 participants, it was not possible to pool data because outcomes' measures were not comparable. Looking at singular studies, no statistically significant difference was seen. - Comparing different classes of antidepressants, the results favour tricyclics for severity of depression, two studies, 183 participants, RR 1.92 (Cl 95% 1.26 to 2.94) and favour placebo for adverse events, two studies, 172 participants, RR 3.11 (Cl 95% 1.06 to 9.12). There is low evidence, at the present, supporting the clinical use of antidepressants for the treatment of depressed opioid addicts in treatment with opioid agonists. There is a need of larger randomised studies investigating relevant outcomes, safety issues and reporting data to allow comparison of results.","There is little evidence to support the use of antidepressants for treating people who are dependent on opioids and have clinical depression. Depression is more common in people with substance abuse and dependence than in the general population. The depression experienced is also associated with an increased risk of completed suicide. Depression may represent an independent disorder, the psychosocial stress associated with addictive behavior or it could be a consequence of drug use and drug withdrawal effects. A maintenance program with opioid agonists (methadone, buprenorphine, LAAM) is an effective treatment for people who are dependent on opioids in terms of retention in treatment and reduced use of opioids. Depression is however still prevalent and negatively impacts on treatment outcomes. Treatment with antidepressant drugs has therefore been proposed. These adjunct drug treatments include tricyclic antidepressants (doxepin, desipramine, imipramine) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs fluoxetine, sertraline). Authors included seven randomised controlled studies that involved 482 participants in our review. The studies were conducted in outpatient settings over four to 16 weeks; six were in USA and one in Australia. The mean age of participants was 34 years and 62% were males. No clear difference was found in the number of dropouts from an opioid agonist maintenance program between people receiving antidepressants and those in the placebo groups. Neither was drug use different (two studies). Severity of depression was reduced with the use of antidepressants (two studies), including tricyclic antidepressants. Adverse events were important as more of the participants who received antidepressants withdrew from the studies for medical reasons compared with those participants on placebo (four studies). The differences between studies in clinical (participant characteristics, the medications used, services and treatments delivered) and methodological characteristics (study design and quality) made it difficult to draw confident conclusions about the efficacy and safety of antidepressants for the treatment of depression in people who are dependent on opioids.",1118,depression; opioid dependence; opioid agonist treatment; antidepressants; tricyclics; adverse events,How does the presence of depression influence the outcomes of opioid agonist treatments according to the study?,What criteria should future studies meet to improve evidence on the efficacy of antidepressants for opioid-dependent individuals?,Select all of the following that are colors,What is the main conclusion about antidepressant use for opioid dependents?,"In the summary, how did adverse events affect antidepressant use in the studies?",It enhances the retention of participants in treatment programs.; It negatively impacts the treatment outcomes.; It has no significant impact on treatment outcomes.,It negatively impacts the treatment outcomes.,Larger randomized trials with relevant outcome reporting.; Increased focus on drug misuse prevention.; Studies with diverse participant characteristics.,Larger randomized trials with relevant outcome reporting.; Studies with diverse participant characteristics.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Little evidence supports their use; They are highly recommended; They completely cure both addiction and depression,Little evidence supports their use,They led to more study withdrawals; They had no impact on the studies; They improved retention in studies,They led to more study withdrawals
5ba849b3a2a1ae0001f08d2d,finetuned_6,What are the benefits and risks of cognitive rehabilitation for people with mild-to-moderate dementia?,"Cognitive impairments affect functional ability in people with dementia. Cognitive rehabilitation (CR) is a personalised, solution-focused approach that aims to enable people with mild-to-moderate dementia to manage everyday activities and maintain as much independence as possible. To evaluate the effects of CR on everyday functioning and other outcomes for people with mild-to-moderate dementia, and on outcomes for care partners. To identify and explore factors that may be associated with the efficacy of CR. We searched the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialised Register, which contains records from MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, LILACS, and other clinical trial databases, and grey literature sources. The most recent search was completed on 19 October 2022. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing CR with control conditions and reporting relevant outcomes for the person with dementia and/or the care partner. We extracted relevant data from published manuscripts and contacted trial authors if necessary. Within each of the comparisons, we pooled data for each outcome of interest and conducted inverse-variance, random-effects meta-analyses. We evaluated the certainty of the evidence using GRADEpro GDT. We identified six eligible RCTs published in English between 2010 and 2022, which together included 1702 participants. The mean age of participants ranged from 76 to 80 and the proportion of male participants was between 29.4% and 79.3%. Most participants, in the studies where the type of dementia was reported, had a diagnosis of Alzheimers disease (AD; n = 1002, 58.9% of the whole sample, 81.2% of the participants for whom the specific diagnosis was reported). Risk of bias in the individual studies was relatively low. The exception was a high risk of bias in relation to blinding of participants and practitioners, which is not usually feasible with psychosocial interventions. Our primary outcome of everyday functioning was operationalised in the included studies as goal attainment in relation to activities targeted in the intervention. For our main comparison of CR with usual care, we pooled data for goal attainment evaluated from three perspectives (self-rating of performance, informant rating of performance, and self-rating of satisfaction with performance) at end of treatment and at medium-term follow-up (3 to 12 months). We could also pool data at these time points for 20 and 19 secondary outcomes respectively. The review findings were strongly driven by one large, high-quality RCT. We found high-certainty evidence of large positive effects of CR on all three primary outcome perspectives at the end of treatment: participant self-ratings of goal attainment (standardised mean difference (SMD) 1.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.26 to 1.66; I2 = 0%; 3 RCTs, 501 participants), informant ratings of goal attainment (SMD 1.61, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.21; I2 = 41%; 3 RCTs, 476 participants), and self-ratings of satisfaction with goal attainment (SMD 1.31, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.54; I2 = 5%; 3 RCTs, 501 participants), relative to an inactive control condition. At medium-term follow-up, we found high-certainty evidence showing a large positive effect of CR on all three primary outcome perspectives: participant self-ratings of goal attainment (SMD 1.46, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.68; I2 = 0%; 2 RCTs, 432 participants), informant ratings of goal attainment (SMD 1.25, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.72; I2 = 29%; 3 RCTs, 446 participants), and self-ratings of satisfaction with goal attainment (SMD 1.19, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.66; I2 = 28%; 2 RCTs, 432 participants), relative to an inactive control condition. For participants at the end of treatment we found high-certainty evidence showing a small positive effect of CR on self-efficacy (2 RCTs, 456 participants) and immediate recall (2 RCTs, 459 participants). For participants at medium-term follow-up we found moderate-certainty evidence showing a small positive effect of CR on auditory selective attention (2 RCTs, 386 participants), and a small negative effect on general functional ability (3 RCTs, 673 participants), and we found low-certainty evidence showing a small positive effect on sustained attention (2 RCTs, 413 participants), and a small negative effect on memory (2 RCTs, 51 participants) and anxiety (3 RCTs, 455 participants). We found moderate- and low-certainty evidence indicating that at the end of treatment CR had negligible effects on participant anxiety, quality of life, sustained attention, memory, delayed recall, and general functional ability, and at medium-term follow-up on participant self-efficacy, depression, quality of life, immediate recall, and verbal fluency. For care partners at the end of treatment we found low-certainty evidence showing a small positive effect on environmental aspects of quality of life (3 RCTs, 465 care partners), and small negative effects of CR on level of depression (2 RCTs, 32 care partners) and on psychological wellbeing (2 RCTs, 388 care partners). For care partners at medium-term follow-up we found high-certainty evidence showing a small positive effect of CR on social aspects of quality of life (3 RCTs, 436 care partners) and moderate-certainty evidence showing a small positive effect on psychological aspects of quality of life (3 RCTs, 437 care partners). We found moderate- and low-certainty evidence at the end of treatment that CR had negligible effects on care partners physical health, psychological and social aspects of quality of life, and stress, and at medium-term follow-up for the physical health aspect of care partners quality of life and psychological wellbeing. CR is helpful in enabling people with mild or moderate dementia to improve their ability to manage the everyday activities targeted in the intervention. Confidence in these findings could be strengthened if more high-quality studies contributed to the observed effects. The available evidence suggests that CR can form a valuable part of a clinical toolkit to assist people with dementia in overcoming some of the everyday barriers imposed by cognitive and functional difficulties. Future research, including process evaluation studies, could help identify avenues to maximise CR effects and achieve wider impacts on functional ability and wellbeing.","Dementia is a group of symptoms caused by changes in the brain that get worse over time. People with some types of dementia have difficulties with memory, planning, concentrating, and communicating. These and other thinking difficulties are collectively described by the umbrella term, 'cognitive impairment'. Cognitive impairment makes it harder to do daily activities and stay independent for as long as possible.
Cognitive rehabilitation is a personalised intervention. People have one-to-one sessions with a practitioner, usually in their own home. People identify everyday activities and tasks that they would like to manage better or do more independently. The practitioner suggests strategies and works with them to help achieve these improvements in the activities that are important to them. Family members are often involved as well.
We explored whether cognitive rehabilitation was better than usual treatment for: doing a chosen task or activity that matters to the person; managing daily activities; feeling confident about being able to manage things; feeling depressed or anxious; having a sense of wellbeing. We also explored whether cognitive rehabilitation was better for ensuring the wellbeing of the care partner - usually a husband, wife, or other close family member.
We searched for studies that rigorously tested the effects of cognitive rehabilitation for people with mild-to-moderate dementia. In these studies, some people had their usual treatment and others had their usual treatment plus cognitive rehabilitation. This made it possible to see whether cognitive rehabilitation was more helpful than usual treatment alone. We compared and summarised the results of the studies. We rated our confidence in the evidence the studies provided, based on the methods used and the numbers of people involved. We found six studies. They involved 1702 people with mild-to-moderate dementia, who had between 8 and 14 sessions with a cognitive rehabilitation practitioner. Alzheimers disease was the most common dementia diagnosis (59% of all participants, 82% of participants with the specific diagnosis reported).
The main findings are that, compared to people who just had their usual treatment, people who had cognitive rehabilitation got better at doing their chosen tasks or activities.
This improvement was seen by the people with dementia and by their care partners. The improvement was seen straight after cognitive rehabilitation and was still noticeable 3 to 12 months later.
Straight after cognitive rehabilitation, compared to people who just had their usual treatment, people with dementia may feel more confident about how they are managing.
There might not be any differences in the wellbeing of people with dementia and their care partners. We are not sure if there are any differences for people with dementia in managing other tasks or activities or in feeling depressed. Three to 12 months after cognitive rehabilitation, compared to usual treatment, care partners may have better psychological wellbeing.
There may not be any differences in how well people with dementia manage other tasks or activities, in how confident or depressed they feel, or in their wellbeing.
Our review included six studies, but the findings are based mostly on information from one large study. We do not know if the effects of cognitive rehabilitation last more than a year.

5ba849b3a2a1ae0001f08d2d,finetuned_6,Ezetimibe for the prevention of heart disease and death,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains an important cause of mortality and morbidity, and high levels of blood cholesterol are thought to be the major modifiable risk factors for CVD. The use of statins is the preferred treatment strategy for the prevention of CVD, but some people at high-risk for CVD are intolerant to statin therapy or unable to achieve their treatment goals with the maximal recommended doses of statin. Ezetimibe is a selective cholesterol absorption inhibitor, whether it has a positive effect on CVD events remains uncertain. Results from clinical studies are inconsistent and a thorough evaluation of its efficacy and safety for the prevention of CVD and mortality is necessary.
To assess the efficacy and safety of ezetimibe for the prevention of CVD and all-cause mortality.
We searched the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and Web of Science on 27 June 2018, and two clinical trial registry platforms on 11 July 2018. We checked reference lists from primary studies and review articles for additional studies. No language restrictions were applied.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared ezetimibe versus placebo or ezetimibe plus other lipid-modifying drugs versus other lipid-modifying drugs alone in adults, with or without CVD, and which had a follow-up of at least 12 months.
Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, assessed risk of bias and contacted trialists to obtain missing data. We performed statistical analyses according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and used the GRADE to assess the quality of evidence.
We included 26 RCTs randomising 23,499 participants. All included studies assessed effects of ezetimibe plus other lipid-modifying drugs compared with other lipid-modifying drugs alone or plus placebo. Our findings were driven by the largest study (IMPROVE-IT), which had weights ranging from 41.5% to 98.4% in the different meta-analyses. Ezetimibe with statins probably reduces the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events compared with statins alone (risk ratio (RR) 0.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90 to 0.98; a decrease from 284/1000 to 267/1000, 95% CI 256 to 278; 21,727 participants; 10 studies; moderate-quality evidence). Trials reporting all-cause mortality used ezetimibe with statin or fenofibrate and found they have little or no effect on this outcome (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.05; 21,222 participants; 8 studies; high-quality evidence). Adding ezetimibe to statins probably reduces the risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.95; a decrease from 105/1000 to 92/1000, 95% CI 85 to 100; 21,145 participants; 6 studies; moderate-quality evidence) and non-fatal stroke (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.97; a decrease 32/1000 to 27/1000, 95% CI 23 to 31; 21,205 participants; 6 studies; moderate-quality evidence). Trials reporting cardiovascular mortality added ezetimibe to statin or fenofibrate, probably having little or no effect on this outcome (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.12; 19457 participants; 6 studies; moderate-quality evidence). The need for coronary revascularisation might be reduced by adding ezetimibe to statin (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.89 to 0.99; a decrease from 196/1000 to 184/1000, 95% 175 to 194; 21,323 participants; 7 studies); however, no difference in coronary revascularisation rate was observed when a sensitivity analysis was limited to studies with a low risk of bias. In terms of safety, adding ezetimibe to statins may make little or no difference in the risk of hepatopathy (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.35; 20,687 participants; 4 studies; low-quality evidence). It is uncertain whether ezetimibe increase or decrease the risk of myopathy (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.72 to 2.38; 20,581 participants; 3 studies; very low-quality evidence) and rhabdomyolysis, given the wide CIs and low event rate. Little or no difference in the risk of cancer, gallbladder-related disease and discontinuation due to adverse events were observed between treatment groups. For serum lipids, adding ezetimibe to statin or fenofibrate might further reduce the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol and triglyceride levels and likely increase the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels; however, substantial heterogeneity was detected in most analyses. None of the included studies reported on health-related quality of life.
Moderate- to high-quality evidence suggests that ezetimibe has modest beneficial effects on the risk of CVD endpoints, primarily driven by a reduction in non-fatal MI and non-fatal stroke, but it has little or no effect on clinical fatal endpoints. The cardiovascular benefit of ezetimibe might involve the reduction of LDL-C, total cholesterol and triglycerides. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether ezetimibe increases the risk of adverse events due to the low and very low quality of the evidence. The evidence for beneficial effects was mainly obtained from individuals with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD, predominantly with acute coronary syndrome) administered ezetimibe plus statins. However, there is limited evidence regarding the role of ezetimibe in primary prevention and the effects of ezetimibe monotherapy in the prevention of CVD, and these topics thus requires further investigation.","Is taking ezetimibe safe and does it prevent heart disease and death? Heart disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, and controlling lipid levels is one of the most effective strategies for preventing heart disease. The use of statins is the preferred treatment strategy for the prevention of heart disease, but some people at high risk of heart disease are intolerant to statins or with a poor response to statin therapy. Ezetimibe is a non-statin drug that can reduce the blood lipids levels by inhibiting cholesterol absorption, but whether it has beneficial effects on heart disease and death remains uncertain. This evidence is current up to July 2018. We included 26 studies involving 23,499 participants. These studies assessed the effects of ezetimibe plus other lipid-lowering drugs versus lipid-lowering drugs alone for heart disease. The participants were adults, and most of them had been diagnosed with coronary heart disease. Ezetimibe with statins probably reduces the risk for combined outcome of death due to heart disease, heart attack or stroke, but the benefit is moderate. However, adding ezetimibe to statin or fenofibrate have little or no effect on death from any cause. Treatment with ezetimibe and statin probably reduces the risk for non-fatal heart attacks and non-fatal stroke. Adding ezetimibe to statin or fenofibrate probably have little or no effect on heart-related death. Ezetimibe with statins might reduce the need for coronary revascularisation (the restoration of an adequate blood supply to the heart) by means of surgery. In terms of safety, we do not have enough evidence to know whether ezetimibe increases or decreases side-effects (e.g. liver injury, muscle pain, cancer, gallbladder-related disease and discontinuation). The analysis of blood lipids revealed that the addition of ezetimibe statin or fenofibrate therapy might further reduce the levels of blood lipids, including low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ('bad' cholesterol), total cholesterol and triglycerides, and likely increased the level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ('good' cholesterol). None of the included studies reported on health-related quality of life. There is a lack of evidence supporting the use of ezetimibe monotherapy for the prevention of heart disease, and this topic requires further investigation. The quality of evidence ranged from high to very low across the outcomes.",1044,Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; fixed-dose combination therapy; antiplatelet therapy; LDL cholesterol; systolic blood pressure; cardiovascular risk factors; placebo; cholesterol-lowering medication; blood pressure-lowering drugs; major cardiovascular events,What conclusions can be drawn regarding the efficacy of ezetimibe in reducing non-fatal heart attacks and strokes?,"In evaluating the safety profile of ezetimibe, what does the current evidence suggest?",Select the items that are animals,How does the study interpret the role of ezetimibe in cardiovascular mortality?,What is the impact of ezetimibe on blood lipid levels when added to statin therapy?,Ezetimibe with statins probably reduces the risk.; Ezetimibe alone significantly reduces the risk.; The benefit is significant in primary prevention.,Ezetimibe with statins probably reduces the risk.,Evidence is insufficient to determine impact on side-effects.; Ezetimibe is confirmed to increase muscle pain significantly.; All included studies reported consistent adverse impacts.,Evidence is insufficient to determine impact on side-effects.,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,Ezetimibe likely has little effect on heart-related death.; It significantly reduces cardiovascular mortality.; Ezetimibe increases the risk of heart-related death.,Ezetimibe likely has little effect on heart-related death.,It further reduces 'bad' cholesterol levels.; It increases triglyceride levels.; It has no effect on blood lipid levels.,It further reduces 'bad' cholesterol levels.
5ecaf0fa5c1f7f6599d959ff,static_1,L-ornithine L-aspartate for people with chronic liver disease and hepatic encephalopathy (poor brain functioning),"Hepatic encephalopathy is a common complication of cirrhosis and has high associated morbidity and mortality. The condition is classified as overt if it is clinically apparent or minimal if only evident though psychometric testing. The exact pathogenesis of this syndrome is unknown although ammonia is thought to play a key role. L-ornithine L-aspartate has ammonia-lowering properties and may, therefore, benefit people with cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy.
To evaluate the beneficial and harmful effects of L-ornithine L-aspartate versus placebo, no intervention, or other active interventions in people with cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy.
We undertook electronic searches of The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS and Science Citation Index Expanded to December 2017 and manual searches of meetings and conference proceedings; checks of bibliographies; and corresponded with investigators and pharmaceutical companies.
We included randomised clinical trials, irrespective of publication status, language, or blinding. We included participants with cirrhosis who had minimal or overt hepatic encephalopathy or who were at risk for developing hepatic encephalopathy. We compared: L-ornithine L-aspartate versus placebo or no intervention; and L-ornithine L-aspartate versus other active agents such as non-absorbable disaccharides, antibiotics, probiotics, or branched-chain amino acids.
Two review authors, working independently, retrieved data from published reports and correspondence with investigators and pharmaceutical companies. The primary outcomes were mortality, hepatic encephalopathy, and serious adverse events. We undertook meta-analyses and presented the results as risk ratios (RR) and mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed bias control using the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group domains; we evaluated the risk of publication bias and other small trial effects in regression analyses; conducted subgroup and sensitivity analyses; and performed Trial Sequential Analyses. We determined the quality of the evidence using GRADE.
We identified 36 randomised clinical trials, involving at least 2377 registered participants, which fulfilled our inclusion criteria including 10 unpublished randomised clinical trials. However, we were only able to access outcome data from 29 trials involving 1891 participants. Five of the included trials assessed prevention, while 31 trials assessed treatment. Five trials were at low risk of bias in the overall assessment of mortality; one trial was at low risk of bias in the assessment of the remaining outcomes. L-ornithine L-aspartate had a beneficial effect on mortality compared with placebo or no intervention when including all trials (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.72; I2= 0%; 19 trials; 1489 participants; very low quality evidence), but not when the analysis was restricted to the trials at low risk of bias (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.06 to 3.58; 4 trials; 244 participants). It had a beneficial effect on hepatic encephalopathy compared with placebo or no intervention when including all trials (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.83; 22 trials; 1375 participants; I2= 62%; very low quality evidence), but not in the one trial at low risk of bias (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.07; 63 participants). The analysis of serious adverse events showed a potential benefit of L-ornithine L-aspartate when including all randomised clinical trials (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.90; 1 trial; 1489 participants; I2= 0%; very low quality evidence), but not in the one trial at low risk of bias for this outcome (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.15 to 4.65; 63 participants). The Trial Sequential Analyses of mortality, hepatic encephalopathy, and serious adverse events found insufficient evidence to support or refute beneficial effects. Subgroup analyses showed no difference in outcomes in the trials evaluating evaluating the prevention or treatment of either overt or minimal hepatic encephalopathy or trials evaluating oral versus intravenous administration We were unable to undertake a meta-analysis of the three trials involving 288 participants evaluating health-related quality of life. Overall, we found no difference between L-ornithine L-aspartate and placebo or no intervention in non-serious adverse events (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.77; 14 trials; 1076 participants; I2= 40%). In comparison with lactulose, L-ornithine L-aspartate had no effect on mortality (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.11 to 4.17; 4 trials; 175 participants; I2= 0%); hepatic encephalopathy (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.57); serious adverse events (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.22 to 2.11); or non-serious adverse events (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.18). In comparison with probiotics, L-ornithine L-aspartate had no effect on mortality (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.11 to 9.51); serious adverse events (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.23 to 4.88); or changes in blood ammonia concentrations from baseline (RR -2.30 95% CI -6.08 to 1.48), but it had a possible beneficial effect on hepatic encephalopathy (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.90). Finally, in comparison with rifaximin, L-ornithine L-aspartate had no effect on mortality (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.03; 2 trials; 105 participants); hepatic encephalopathy (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.96); serious adverse events (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.42), or non-serious adverse events (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.42).
The results of this review suggest a possible beneficial effect of L-ornithine L-aspartate on mortality, hepatic encephalopathy, and serious adverse events in comparisons with placebo or no-intervention, but, because the quality of the evidence is very low, we are very uncertain about these findings. There was very low quality evidence of a possible beneficial effect of L-ornithine L-aspartate on hepatic encephalopathy, when compared with probiotics, but no other benefits were demonstrated in comparison with other active agents. Additional access to data from completed, but unpublished trials, and new randomised placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trials are needed.","Cirrhosis is a chronic disorder of the liver. People with this condition commonly develop hepatic encephalopathy, a complication that results in poor brain functioning. Some people with cirrhosis develop obvious clinical features of disturbed brain functioning, such as difficulties with speech, balance and daily functioning; they are said to have overt hepatic encephalopathy; the changes may be short-lived, may recur, or may persist for long periods. Other people with cirrhosis may show no obvious clinical changes but some aspects of their brain function, such as attention and the ability to perform complex tasks are found to be impaired when tested; they are said to have minimal hepatic encephalopathy. The reason why people develop hepatic encephalopathy is complex, but the accumulation in the blood of toxins from the gut, particularly of a compound called ammonia, plays a key role. L-ornithine L-aspartate lowers blood ammonia levels and so may have beneficial effects in people with hepatic encephalopathy or help stop them developing it.
We investigated the use of L-ornithine L-aspartate given either by mouth (oral) or into a vein in an fluid drip (intravenous) for the prevention and treatment of hepatic encephalopathy by reviewing clinical trials in which people with cirrhosis were randomly allocated to treatment with L-ornithine L-aspartate, to an inactive dummy (called placebo), to no treatment, or to another medicine for this condition such as lactulose, probiotics and rifaximin. We included participants with cirrhosis who had overt or minimal hepatic encephalopathy or who were at risk for developing this complication.
December 2017.
Six of the 36 randomised clinical trials we included received no funding or any other support from pharmaceutical companies. Seventeen trials received financial support from pharmaceutical companies and a further three received L-ornithine L-aspartate or inactive placebo free of charge; there was no information on funding in the remaining 10 trials.
We included 33 randomised clinical trials comparing L-ornithine L-aspartate with inactive placebo or no intervention and six randomised clinical trials comparing L-ornithine L-aspartate with other anti-encephalopathy treatments; some trials included more than one comparison. Five of the included trials tested L-ornithine L-aspartate for the prevention of hepatic encephalopathy while 30 trials tested its use as treatment for people with acute, chronic, or minimal hepatic encephalopathy. The length of treatment varied from three to 35 days in the trials testing the intravenous preparation (average eight days) and from seven to 180 days in those testing the oral preparation (average 30 days).
The evidence we found was very weak, and so we are not confident that L-ornithine L-aspartate is of use for preventing or treating hepatic encephalopathy in people with cirrhosis. Many studies were unpublished and so had not been carefully vetted, and many of the published trials received support from the pharmaceutical industry which introduces an element of bias. Accordingly, more information is needed before the value of L-ornithine L-aspartate for preventing and treating hepatic encephalopathy can be determined.",1094,Hepatic encephalopathy; cirrhosis; L-ornithine L-aspartate; ammonia-lowering properties; serious adverse events; non-absorbable disaccharides; probiotics; branched-chain amino acids; health-related quality of life; lactulose,How might the studyÃ¢ÂÂs conclusion about the effect of L-ornithine L-aspartate on mortality be critiqued?,Evaluate the potential impact of publication bias on the studyÃ¢ÂÂs results regarding serious adverse events.,Select the items that are animals,How might the trial design be improved to ensure more reliable outcomes in future studies on L-ornithine L-aspartate for hepatic encephalopathy?,What could be deduced about the weight of evidence from trials that were funded by pharmaceutical companies compared to those that were not?,"The conclusion may be overstated due to the very low quality of evidence.; The sample size was too large, creating unnecessary complexity.; The variations in treatment duration could result in inconsistencies.",The conclusion may be overstated due to the very low quality of evidence.; The variations in treatment duration could result in inconsistencies.,Publication bias may have led to an underestimation of adverse events.; Publication bias likely had no effect on the analysis of adverse events.; Publication bias would primarily affect the reporting of positive outcomes.,Publication bias may have led to an underestimation of adverse events.; Publication bias would primarily affect the reporting of positive outcomes.,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,Incorporate a larger number of double-blind trials to reduce bias.; Limit studies to a single administration method to simplify results.; Ensure all funding sources are disclosed to reduce potential bias.,Incorporate a larger number of double-blind trials to reduce bias.; Ensure all funding sources are disclosed to reduce potential bias.,"There might be an increased likelihood of positive outcomes in funded trials.; Funded trials are likely to have fewer participants, affecting outcomes.; Results from funded trials need cautious interpretation due to potential bias.",There might be an increased likelihood of positive outcomes in funded trials.; Results from funded trials need cautious interpretation due to potential bias.
5ecaf0fa5c1f7f6599d959ff,static_2,Drug or psychological interventions for preventing depression in people with long-term physical conditions,"Major depression is one of the world's leading causes of disability in adults with long-term physical conditions compared to those without physical illness. This co-morbidity is associated with a negative prognosis in terms of increased morbidity and mortality rates, increased healthcare costs, decreased adherence to treatment regimens, and a substantial decline in quality of life. Therefore, preventing the onset of depressive episodes in adults with long-term physical conditions should be a global healthcare aim. In this review, primary or tertiary (in cases of preventing recurrences in those with a history of depression) prevention are the focus. While primary prevention aims at preventing the onset of depression, tertiary prevention comprises both preventing recurrences and prohibiting relapses. Tertiary prevention aims to address a depressive episode that might still be present, is about to subside, or has recently resolved. We included tertiary prevention in the case where the focus was preventing the onset of depression in those with a history of depression (preventing recurrences) but excluded it if it specifically focused on maintaining an condition or implementing rehabilitation services (relapse prevention). Secondary prevention of depression seeks to prevent the progression of depressive symptoms by early detection and treatment and may therefore be considered a 'treatment,' rather than prevention. We therefore exclude the whole spectrum of secondary prevention. To assess the effectiveness, acceptability and tolerability of psychological or pharmacological interventions, in comparison to control conditions, in preventing depression in adults with long-term physical conditions; either before first ever onset of depressive symptoms (i.e. primary prevention) or before first onset of depressive symptoms in patients with a history of depression (i.e. tertiary prevention). We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and two trials registries, up to 6 February 2020. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of preventive psychological or pharmacological interventions, specifically targeting incidence of depression in comparison to treatment as usual (TAU), waiting list, attention/psychological placebo, or placebo. Participants had to be age 18 years or older, with at least one long-term physical condition, and no diagnosis of major depression at baseline (primary prevention). In addition, we included studies comprising mixed samples of patients with and without a history of depression, which explored tertiary prevention of recurrent depression. We excluded other tertiary prevention studies. We also excluded secondary preventive interventions. Primary outcomes included incidence of depression, tolerability, and acceptability. Secondary outcomes included severity of depression, cost-effectiveness and cost-utility. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We included 11 RCTs, with one trial on psychological interventions, and 10 trials on pharmacological interventions. Data analyses on the psychological intervention (problem-solving therapy compared to TAU) included 194 participants with age-related macular degeneration. Data analyses on pharmacological interventions included 837 participants comparing citalopram (one trial), escitalopram (three trials), a mixed sample of fluoxetine/nortriptyline (one trial), melatonin (one trial), milnacipran (one trial), and sertraline (three trials), each to placebo. Included types of long-term physical conditions were acute coronary syndrome (one trial), breast cancer (one trial), head and neck cancer (two trials), stroke (five trials), and traumatic brain injury (one trial). Very low-certainty evidence of one study suggests that problem solving therapy may be slightly more effective than TAU in preventing the incidence of depression, immediately post-intervention (odds ratio (OR) 0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.20 to 0.95; 194 participants). However, there may be little to no difference between groups at six months follow-up (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.38; 190 participants; one study; very low-certainty evidence). No data were available regarding incidence of depression after six months. Regarding acceptability (drop-outs due to any cause), slightly fewer drop-outs occurred in the TAU group immediately post-intervention (OR 5.21, 95% CI 1.11 to 24.40; 206 participants; low-certainty evidence). After six months, however, the groups did not differ (OR 1.67, 95% CI 0.58 to 4.77; 206 participants; low-certainty evidence). This study did not measure tolerability. Post-intervention, compared to placebo, antidepressants may be beneficial in preventing depression in adults with different types of long-term physical conditions, but the evidence is very uncertain (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.49; 814 participants; nine studies; I2 = 0%; very low-certainty evidence). There may be little to no difference between groups both immediately and at six months follow-up (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.08 to 2.46; 23 participants; one study; very low-certainty evidence) as well as at six to 12 months follow-up (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.23 to 2.82; 233 participants; three studies; I2 = 49%; very low-certainty evidence). There was very low-certainty evidence from five studies regarding the tolerability of the pharmacological intervention. A total of 669 adverse events were observed in 316 participants from the pharmacological intervention group, and 610 adverse events from 311 participants in the placebo group. There was very low-certainty evidence that drop-outs due to adverse events may be less frequent in the placebo group (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.07 to 3.89; 561 participants; five studies; I2 = 0%). There was also very low-certainty evidence that drop-outs due to any cause may not differ between groups either post-intervention (OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.73; 962 participants; nine studies; I2 = 28%), or at six to 12 months (OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.86; 327 participants; three studies; I2 = 0%). Based on evidence of very low certainty, our results may indicate the benefit of pharmacological interventions, during or directly after preventive treatment. Few trials examined short-term outcomes up to six months, nor the follow-up effects at six to 12 months, with studies suffering from great numbers of drop-outs and inconclusive results. Generalisation of results is limited as study populations and treatment regimes were very heterogeneous. Based on the results of this review, we conclude that for adults with long-term physical conditions, there is only very uncertain evidence regarding the implementation of any primary preventive interventions (psychological/pharmacological) for depression.","People with long-term illness or other physical health conditions have a higher risk than other people of developing depression. This can reduce their quality of life. Depression is characterised by symptoms such as low mood, feelings of hopelessness, loss of interest in things that once gave pleasure, and other symptoms, as well as sleep disturbances. People with long-term physical conditions who develop depression are more likely to worsen in their illnesses and are more likely to die. Therefore, preventing depression in people with long-term physical conditions should be an important goal in healthcare. We wanted to know whether standard interventions for treating depression (i.e. psychological treatments and antidepressant drugs) can also safely be used to prevent the onset of an depressive episode in those adults at high risk for depression due to their long-term physical condition, but who do not yet show depressive symptoms. We also wanted to know whether these interventions worked in preventing recurrent depression, in those patients with long-term physical conditions who had a history of depression. First, we searched the medical literature for randomised controlled studies (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups). This type of study provides the most robust evidence about the effects of a treatment. We then compared the results, and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we assessed how certain the evidence was. To do this, we considered factors such as the way studies were conducted, study sizes, and consistency of findings across studies. Based on our assessments, we categorised the evidence as being of very low, low, moderate or high certainty. Medical and mental health care providers (including physicians and psychologists) and pharmacists, as well as adults with long-term physical conditions, their relatives and care-givers. This review includes 11 trials comparing a psychological intervention (problem-solving therapy) to treatment as usual; or comparing pharmacological antidepressant interventions (citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline, fluoxetine/nortriptyline, milnacipran, or melatonin) to placebo. For the psychological intervention, we found only one trial, including 194 people with age-related macular degeneration (an eye disease). For pharmacological interventions, we included 10 trials comprising 1009 people. Due to some participants not completing the studies, we could only analyse data for 837 participants. Our analyses show that people with long-term physical conditions may be less likely to develop depression during treatment with problem solving therapy, or with different types of antidepressants. However, these interventions appear to be beneficial only during treatment. Three to 12 months after treatment, there was no significant difference in onset of depression between the groups that had the interventions and those that did not. Therefore, preventive interventions might be effective in preventing depression onset only for the duration of the intervention. Our conclusions are based on evidence of very low certainty. In addition, there is not enough adequate information on the tolerability (unpleasant but generally medically less important adverse events due to the intervention, e.g. dry mouth) and acceptability (willingness to go through with the intervention even in the presence of adverse events) of these treatments. The interventions may be unsafe, irrespective of their potential to prevent depression.",1119,major depression; disability; co-morbidity; primary prevention; tertiary prevention; depressive episodes; psychological interventions; pharmacological interventions; antidepressants; very low-certainty evidence,"Based on the summary, how valid is it to generalize the study findings to all adults with long-term physical conditions?",What are the main reasons for attempting to prevent depression in people with long-term physical conditions?,Select the items that are animals,How might the onset of depression affect people with long-term physical conditions?,Which interventions were assessed for preventing depression in the study?,"Highly valid, as the study included a large diverse cohort.; Limited validity due to varied physical conditions represented.; Invalid, as the study focused solely on specific conditions like cancer and stroke.",Limited validity due to varied physical conditions represented.,To reduce the risk of developing depression; To increase healthcare costs; To prevent worsening of physical illnesses,To reduce the risk of developing depression; To prevent worsening of physical illnesses,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,It may improve their quality of life; It may increase the risk of mortality; It may decrease adherence to their treatment,It may increase the risk of mortality; It may decrease adherence to their treatment,Psychological interventions; Dietary supplements; Pharmacological interventions,Psychological interventions; Pharmacological interventions
5ecaf0fa5c1f7f6599d959ff,static_2,Splints and other non-surgical methods for treating common injuries of the middle joints of the fingers,"Immobilisation and early motion (protected or unrestricted) are both used following hyperextension injuries to the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint of the finger. The aim of this review was to assess the effects of conservative (non-surgical) interventions for treating hyperextension injuries of the PIP joints. We searched multiple databases and trial registers up to early 2012. Randomised and quasi-randomised studies comparing immobilisation, protected mobilisation, or unrestricted mobilisation in people with non-surgically managed PIP hyperextension injuries were eligible. Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data, but no pooling was possible. Three trials with 366 participants were identified; all were over 15 years old and had methodological weaknesses with unclear or high risk of bias. None reported self-assessed function. One trial compared unrestricted mobility with immobilisation, one compared protected mobilisation with immobilisation, and one compared immobilisation for one week versus three weeks. None found statistically significant differences between groups in poor outcomes, pain, or range of movement at six months, and for the unrestricted-mobility versus immobilisation comparison, no differences were found even at three years. Overall, evidence from trials is insufficient to guide decisions on whether immobilisation is needed, and if so, for how long or to what extent, when treating PIP hyperextension injuries.","Injury to the ligaments of the middle joint (proximal interphalangeal joint) of a finger may occur as a result of the finger being forced backwards. This is known as a hyperextension injury. Characteristically, this occurs in sporting accidents, such as where a football strikes an outstretched hand. These injuries are common and typically affect people of working age. Usually, these patients are treated without surgery using a combination of support (splinting/strapping to the adjacent finger) and exercise advice. Use of the hand is commonly encouraged but restricted to some degree by the severity of the injury. By examining the evidence from randomised controlled trials, this review aimed to assess which treatment for hyperextension injuries of the proximal interphalangeal joints of the fingers results in the best outcome for patients. The outcomes examined included function (including return to work), pain and joint movement.
Three small studies including a total of 366 patients met the inclusion criteria for the review. The studies, which were all over 15 years old, were prone to bias. None of the studies reported any self assessment of function by participants. One study compared unrestricted mobility with immobilisation. One trial compared protected mobilisation (using a removable support in combination with exercise) with immobilisation. The remaining study compared immobilisation for one week versus three weeks. None of these trials found important differences between their intervention groups in various measures of poor outcome, pain and range of movement at six months follow-up.
We concluded that there was a lack of robust evidence to inform on the need for, and the extent and duration of, immobilisation for these injuries.",1055,immobilisation; hyperextension injuries; proximal interphalangeal joint; conservative interventions; protected mobilisation; unrestricted mobilisation; self-assessed function; range of movement; unrestricted mobility,What types of injuries are hyperextension injuries of the proximal interphalangeal joint?,What was the motivation behind the review?,Select all of the following that are colors,Which methods of conservative treatment were compared in the studies?,Summarize the results reported regarding differences in outcomes between intervention groups.,Ligament injuries from finger hyperextension; Fractures to the fingertip; Tendon injuries from bending,Ligament injuries from finger hyperextension,To find the best non-surgical treatment for finger hyperextension injuries; To promote surgical interventions for all finger injuries; To explore all possible injuries to the hand,To find the best non-surgical treatment for finger hyperextension injuries,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Unrestricted mobility vs. immobilisation; Only surgery vs. non-surgery; Protected mobilisation vs. medication,Unrestricted mobility vs. immobilisation,No important differences found; Significant outcomes in terms of recovery; Minor differences but not statistically significant,No important differences found; Minor differences but not statistically significant
5ecaf0fa5c1f7f6599d959ff,interactive_3,Integrated compared with non-integrated orbital implants for treating anophthalmic sockets,"Anophthalmia is the absence of one or both eyes, and it can be congenital (i.e. a birth defect) or acquired later in life. There are two main types of orbital implant: integrated, whereby the implant receives a blood supply from the body that allows for the integration of the prosthesis within the tissue; and non-integrated, where the implant remains separate. Despite the remarkable progress in anophthalmic socket reconstruction and in the development of various types of implants, there are still uncertainties about the real roles of integrated (hydroxyapatite (HA), porous polyethylene (PP), composites) and non-integrated (polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA)/acrylic and silicone) orbital implants in anophthalmic socket treatment.
To assess the effects of integrated versus non-integrated orbital implants for treating anophthalmic sockets.
We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2016, Issue 7), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to August 2016), Embase (January 1980 to August 2016), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (1982 to August 2016), the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov), and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 8 August 2016.
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of integrated and non-integrated orbital implants for treating anophthalmic sockets.
Two authors independently selected relevant trials, assessed methodological quality and extracted data.
We included three studies with a total of 284 participants (250 included in analysis). The studies were conducted in India, Iran and the Netherlands. The three studies were clinically heterogenous, comparing different materials and using different surgical techniques. None of the included studies used a peg (i.e. a fixing pin used to connect the implant to the prosthesis). In general the trials were poorly reported, and we judged them to be at unclear risk of bias. One trial compared HA using traditional enucleation versus alloplastic implantation using evisceration (N = 100). This trial was probably not masked. The second trial compared PP with scleral cap enucleation versus PMMA with either myoconjunctival or traditional enucleation (N = 150). Although participants were not masked, outcome assessors were. The last trial compared HA and acrylic using the enucleation technique (N = 34) but did not report comparative effectiveness data. In the trial comparing HA versus alloplastic implantation, there was no evidence of any difference between the two groups with respect to the proportion of successful procedures at one year (risk ratio (RR) 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95 to 1.09, N = 100, low-certainty evidence). People receiving HA had slightly worse horizontal implant mobility compared to the alloplastic group (mean difference (MD) -3.35 mm, 95% CI - 4.08 to - 2.62, very low-certainty evidence) and slightly worse vertical implant motility (MD -2.76 mm, 95% CI -3.45 to -2.07, very low-certainty evidence). As different techniques were used - enucleation versus evisceration - it is not clear whether these differences in implant motility can be attributed solely to the type of material. Investigators did not report adverse events. In the trial comparing PP versus PMMA, there was no evidence of any difference between the two groups with respect to the proportion of successful procedures at one year (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.01, N = 150, low-certainty evidence). There was very low-certainty evidence of a difference in horizontal implant motility depending on whether PP was compared to PMMA with traditional enucleation (MD 1.96 mm, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.91) or PMMA with myoconjunctival enucleation (-0.57 mm, 95% CI -1.63 to 0.49). Similarly, for vertical implant motility, there was very low-certainty evidence of a difference in the comparison of PP to PMMA traditional (MD 3.12 mm 95% CI 2.36 to 3.88) but no evidence of a difference when comparing PP to PMMA myoconjunctival (MD -0.20 mm 95% CI  -1.28 to 0.88). Four people in the PP group (total N = 50) experienced adverse events (i.e. exposures) compared to 6/100 in the PMMA groups (RR 17.82, 95% CI 0.98 to 324.67, N = 150, very low-certainty evidence). None of the studies reported socket sphere size, cosmetic effect or quality of life measures.
Current very low-certainty evidence from three small published randomised controlled trials did not provide sufficient evidence to assess the effect of integrated and non-integrated material orbital implants for treating anophthalmic sockets. This review underlines the need to conduct further well-designed trials in this field.","The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out if integrated orbital implants are better than non-integrated orbital implants for treating anophthalmic sockets. Cochrane researchers collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found three studies.
There is uncertainty as to the benefits and harms of integrated compared with non-integrated orbital implants. What was studied in the review? 'Anophthalmia' is the absence of the eye in the orbit. This can occur in childhood (because of problems with development) or it can happen during the course of life (due to an accident or other eye disease).
Doctors can put an implant in the orbit to fill the void left by the removal of the eye and this together with an external prosthesis can improve the patient's appearance. This orbital implant can be made of two types of materials - integrated or non-integrated material. If the material is integrated, then new blood vessels can grow into the implant material. If the material is non-integrated, then the orbital implant remains separate from the rest of the orbit's tissue.
The review authors looked to see if the type of implant material affected the success of the surgery or, in other words, if integrated implants can provide better results than non-integrated implants. They were also interested in how much the external prosthesis could move better after surgery - using integrated or non-integrated orbital implants. Also, the authors wanted to know if the type of orbital implant material can affect people's quality of life. Were there any adverse (harmful) effects of using integrated or non-integrated orbital implants?
The type of material used for the orbital implant may not affect the success of the surgery (low-certainty evidence). The review authors judged the evidence on prosthesis movement and adverse effects as providing very little certainty about the true effects. There was no information on quality of life.

5ecaf0fa5c1f7f6599d959ff,interactive_4,What were the unintended consequences of school-based measures to manage the COVID-19 pandemic?,"Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, schools were a key setting for intervening with public health and social measures (PHSM) to reduce transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Consequently, there is a need to assess the varied unintended consequences associated with PHSM implemented in the school setting, for students, teachers, and school staff, as well as for families and the wider community. This is an update of a Cochrane scoping review first published in 2022. To comprehensively identify and summarise the published literature on the unintended consequences of public health and social measures implemented in the school setting to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2. This will serve to identify critical knowledge gaps to inform future primary research and systematic reviews. It may also serve as a resource for future pandemic management. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, PsycINFO, ERIC, and Web of Science on 5 and 6 January 2023. We also searched two COVID-19-specific databases (Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease). Finally, we reviewed the included studies of all relevant systematic reviews and guidelines identified through the searches. We included studies that empirically assessed the impact of PHSM implemented in the school setting to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2. We imposed no restrictions with regard to the types of populations and specific interventions. Outcomes of interest were consequences that were measured or experienced, but not anticipated consequences. This review focused on real-world evidence: empirical quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-method studies were eligible for inclusion, but modelling studies were ineligible. The review was guided by a logic model. In line with the latest Cochrane effectiveness review of school measures to contain COVID-19 and a conceptual framework of PHSM, this logic model distinguishes between measures to make contacts safer (related to individual protection and the physical environment), measures to reduce contacts (related to social interactions, movement, and services) and surveillance and response measures. Unintended consequences comprise the following categories: health and well-being, health system and social welfare services, human and fundamental rights, acceptability and adherence, equality and equity, social and institutional, economic and resource, and ecological. The review team screened all titles and abstracts, then potentially eligible full-text articles, in duplicate. Across the included studies, we summarised and presented types of measures, consequences, and study designs using the predefined categories of the logic model, while allowing for emerging categories. We included 60 studies (57 new to this update) from 25 countries. There were 31 quantitative studies, 17 qualitative studies, and 12 mixed-method studies. Most targeted either students (26 studies), teachers and school staff (11 studies), or students and school staff (12 studies). Others evaluated measures aimed at parents (2 studies), staff and parents (1 study), students and teachers (3 studies), or the whole school (5 studies). The measures were related to individual protection (26 studies), the physical environment (20 studies), social interactions (25 studies), services (1 study), movement (3 studies), surveillance (9 studies) and response (7 studies). Nine studies evaluated the combined effect of multiple measures. The main consequences assessed were from the categories health and well-being (29 studies), acceptability and adherence (31 studies), and social and institutional (23 studies). Fewer studies covered consequences from the categories equality and equity (2 studies), economic and resource (7 studies), and ecological (1 study). No studies examined consequences for the health system and social welfare services or for human and fundamental rights. This scoping review provides an overview of the evidence on the unintended consequences of PHSM implemented in the school setting to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2. The 60 included studies describe a broad body of evidence and cover a range of measures and unintended consequences, primarily consequences for health and well-being, acceptability and adherence, social and institutional aspects, and economic aspects. The main gaps identified relate to consequences of school measures for the health system and social welfare services, human and fundamental rights, equality and equity, and the environment. Further research is needed to fill these gaps, making use of diverse methodological approaches. Future studies should explore unintended consequences - whether beneficial or harmful -  in more depth and over longer time periods, in different population groups, and across different contexts. A more robust evidence base could inform and facilitate decisions about whether, how, and when to implement or terminate COVID-19 risk mitigation measures in school settings, and how to counter negative unintended consequences.","During the COVID-19 pandemic, different measures were implemented in schools to help stop the virus spreading. These measures included changes to school rules or actions with the following goals: To reduce the spread of the virus when people were together, To reduce the number of face-to-face contacts between people, To test whether people had COVID-19, To isolate those with COVID-19 to prevent it spreading. School measures like these can have both planned (intended) effects and unplanned (unintended) effects, which we need to monitor. For example, a rule to improve hand hygiene should lead to more handwashing (a planned effect) but could also lead to skin problems (an unplanned effect). These unplanned effects can be negative or positive, and can affect students, teachers, other school staff members, parents, and the wider community. We identified four types of school measures: Measures to make contacts safer, Measures to reduce the opportunity for contacts, Surveillance and response measures, Multi-component measures. We aimed to find and describe evidence on the unplanned effects of school measures implemented to help contain the spread of COVID-19. We searched for studies that looked at side effects of school measures. We grouped the side effects into the following categories: Physical and mental health and well-being, Health and social care services, Human rights, Acceptability of measures, Unfair differences in health outcomes, Civil life, social interactions, and education, Money and resources, The environment. We summarised the available information on school measures and their side effects. We included 60 studies from 25 countries. Regarding study design, 31 used numbers and statistics, 17 used text and descriptions, and 12 used both numbers and descriptions. Most studies looked at measures for staff (11 studies) or students (26 studies), or measures aimed at both staff and students or the whole school (20 studies). Only three studies looked at measures for parents or caregivers. The studies investigated the following measures in schools: Individual protection (26 studies); for example, wearing masks, Changes to the physical environment (20 studies); for example, improving ventilation, Rules about social interactions (25 studies); for example, mixing online and in-person teaching, Changes to services (1 study); for example, cancelling extracurricular activities, Rules about movement (3 studies); for example, staying in class at break time, Surveillance measures (9 studies); for example, testing students and teachers, Response measures (7 studies); for example, isolating people with COVID-19. Nine studies looked at the joint effects of more than one measure (for example, joint effects of wearing masks and improving ventilation). Most studies focused on the following unplanned effects: The influence of school measures on health and well-being (29 studies), Whether school measures were acceptable or easy to carry out (31 studies), How school measures affected social interactions, school organisation, and education (23 studies). Other unplanned effects included the following: Changes to unfair differences in health outcomes (2 studies), Effects on money and resources (7 studies), Effects on the environment (1 study). Most of the studies in the review looked at the influence of school measures on health and well-being; social interactions, school organisation, and education; and whether measures were acceptable and easy to carry out. The most common school measures were wearing masks, cleaning and disinfecting rooms and surfaces, mixing online and in-person learning, and ensuring physical distancing. Many studies also looked at combinations of several measures. This review identified the gaps, where more research is needed. We need more studies to look at a wider variety of unplanned effects. We also need more studies looking at the unplanned effects of other school measures, such as testing and response measures. Future studies should look at long-term effects, too. We need more information about how these measures work in different types of schools and in different countries. This would help people make decisions about when and how to use different school measures.",1105,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; public health and social measures; physical environment; surveillance and response measures; equality and equity; social welfare services; human and fundamental rights; acceptability and adherence; scoping review; risk mitigation measures,What factors should be considered to enhance the evidence base on unintended consequences of school measures in future studies?,How might combining different school measures affect the study outcomes regarding unintended consequences?,Select all of the following that are colors,What are the implications of the knowledge gaps identified in the study for pandemic management in schools?,What was the main goal of the measures implemented in schools during the COVID-19 pandemic?,Focusing solely on quantitative studies; Exploring unintended consequences across diverse contexts and populations; Limiting research to current measures without considering new interventions,Exploring unintended consequences across diverse contexts and populations,It could identify synergies and overlapping effects; It would ensure that every measure's consequence is isolated and clear; It might make it harder to attribute specific outcomes to individual measures,It could identify synergies and overlapping effects; It might make it harder to attribute specific outcomes to individual measures,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,They suggest a need for diverse methodological research approaches; They indicate that all necessary measures have been adequately assessed; They reveal that unintended consequences are well understood in all areas,They suggest a need for diverse methodological research approaches,To stop the spread of the virus in school settings; To improve academic performance; To increase physical activities,To stop the spread of the virus in school settings
5ecaf0fa5c1f7f6599d959ff,interactive_4,Does the DASH diet help people with or at risk of cardiovascular diseases?,"The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet is designed to lower blood pressure and improve cardiovascular health by reducing sodium and unhealthy fats while increasing nutrients such as potassium, calcium, magnesium, and fibre. While evidence supports its benefits for managing cardiovascular risk factors, gaps remain in understanding its long-term impact on preventing cardiovascular disease, particularly major outcomes like myocardial infarction and stroke. This review assessed the effects of the DASH diet for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. We used standard Cochrane search methods, with the latest search conducted in May 2024. We included randomised controlled trials comparing DASH diet interventions to no intervention, minimal intervention (brief dietary advice or informational leaflets without a structured programme), or other dietary interventions, with adult participants who had or did not have cardiovascular disease. Interventions lasted at least eight weeks, with a minimum follow-up of three months. Primary outcomes were myocardial infarction, heart failure, and stroke; secondary outcomes included revascularisation procedures, all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, changes in blood pressure and blood lipids, incidence of type 2 diabetes, health-related quality of life, and adverse effects. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence. Five trials involving 1397 participants met inclusion criteria; all were primary prevention trials involving generally healthy adults without diagnosed cardiovascular disease. Intervention durations ranged from 16 weeks to 12 months, with follow-up periods up to 18 months. Trials were conducted in the USA and Poland, funded by public institutions. In comparisons of the DASH diet versus no intervention, one small trial reported no myocardial infarctions, strokes, or deaths, with low or very low certainty due to high or unclear risk of bias and imprecision. No data were available for heart failure or revascularisation procedures. In comparisons of the DASH diet versus minimal intervention, two trials reported very few myocardial infarctions and no strokes, with no clear differences between groups (RR for myocardial infarction 2.99, 95% CI 0.12 to 73.04), and no data for heart failure, mortality, or revascularisation outcomes. In comparisons of the DASH diet versus another dietary intervention, one trial reported no clear difference in all-cause mortality (RR 2.98, 95% CI 0.12 to 72.42), with very low certainty of evidence. Across comparisons, the DASH diet may lower blood pressure, total cholesterol, and triglycerides and increase HDL cholesterol relative to no intervention or usual care, but appears to have little to no effect on LDL cholesterol. Reported adverse effects were minimal, though the absence of long-term safety data limits conclusions. Overall, the effects of the DASH diet on major cardiovascular outcomes myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality remain uncertain due to the limited number of trials, small sample sizes, high risk of bias, and short follow-up durations. All included studies evaluated primary prevention, with no evidence for secondary prevention. Well-designed, long-term randomised controlled trials are needed to determine the DASH diets true impact on major cardiovascular events, its role in secondary prevention, and its long-term safety.","Cardiovascular disease refers to conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels, usually caused by a build-up of fatty deposits inside the vessels that can narrow them and lead to blood clots. These clots may block blood flow to the heart and cause a heart attack, or cut off blood supply to the brain and cause a stroke. Cardiovascular disease is a major cause of death and disability, but many cases can be prevented through healthy lifestyle choices. Diet is one of the most important and well-known risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The DASH diet was developed to help lower high blood pressure, a key contributor to heart disease. It focuses on eating fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins, while reducing salt, red meat, and sugar. There is strong evidence that the DASH diet can lower blood pressure, which might help prevent heart disease, but its effects on preventing heart attacks and strokes are not yet fully understood. Prevention can be primary (preventing the first event) or secondary (preventing another event in people who already have heart disease). We wanted to find out whether the DASH diet can prevent cardiovascular diseases in people with or without existing heart disease, and whether it causes any unwanted effects. To answer this, we searched for studies comparing the DASH diet with a regular diet, a minimal intervention (such as general advice or information leaflets), or another structured diet programme like the Mediterranean diet. We summarised the findings and assessed how confident we could be in the evidence. We found five studies involving 1397 people, all of whom did not have cardiovascular disease, meaning the studies assessed the DASH diet for primary prevention only. No studies looked at people who already had cardiovascular disease. The studies lasted between 16 weeks and 18 months and were funded by public or nonprofit organisations, including the US National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute, and the Institute of Cardiology in Poland. Overall, the evidence remains unclear on whether the DASH diet reduces the risk of major cardiovascular events such as heart attacks, strokes, the need for heart procedures, or death from cardiovascular disease. The DASH diet may not cause harmful effects, but the evidence is limited, so we cannot be certain. There were several limitations to the evidence. People in some studies may have known which diet they were following, which could influence results. All studies included participants without cardiovascular disease, leaving us unable to assess whether the DASH diet helps people who already have heart disease. Studies were also small and relatively short, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions about long-term benefits or safety. Larger, well-designed studies with longer follow-up are needed to clarify how effective the DASH diet is at preventing serious heart problems and whether it is safe over the long term.",1046,DASH diet; cardiovascular health; hypertension; myocardial infarction; stroke; cardiovascular disease; primary prevention; secondary prevention; revascularisation procedures; LDL cholesterol,What does the absence of data on secondary prevention reveal about the study's scope regarding cardiovascular disease?,What was the primary focus of the review related to the DASH diet?,Select all of the following that are colors,What are examples of unhealthy dietary components reduced by the DASH diet?,What dietary elements does the DASH diet focus on increasing?,The study provides comprehensive insights into DASH diet effects for all patients.; It highlights a gap in understanding the DASH diet's impact on those with existing heart disease.; The study intentionally excluded secondary prevention for focus on initial prevention.,It highlights a gap in understanding the DASH diet's impact on those with existing heart disease.,Evaluating weight loss results; Preventing cardiovascular diseases; Increasing muscular strength,Preventing cardiovascular diseases,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,"Sodium, red meat, sugar; Fruits and vegetables; Calcium and magnesium","Sodium, red meat, sugar","Fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins; Dairy products and processed foods; Fried foods and sweets","Fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins"
5ecaf0fa5c1f7f6599d959ff,finetuned_5,"Pharmacological, non-invasive brain stimulation and psychological interventions for treating depression after stroke","Depression is an important morbidity associated with stroke that impacts on recovery, yet is often undetected or inadequately treated. This review aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of pharmacological intervention, non-invasive brain stimulation, psychological therapy, or combinations of these to treat depression after stroke. This is a living systematic review, and we search for new evidence every two months and update the review when we identify relevant new evidence; we searched the Specialised Registers of Cochrane Stroke and Cochrane Depression Anxiety and Neurosis, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, five other databases, two clinical trials registers, reference lists and conference proceedings (February 2022), and contacted study authors. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were eligible if they compared pharmacological interventions with placebo; non-invasive brain stimulation with sham stimulation or usual care; psychological therapy with usual care or attention control; pharmacological intervention and psychological therapy with pharmacological intervention and usual care or attention control; pharmacological intervention and non-invasive brain stimulation with pharmacological intervention and sham stimulation or usual care; non-invasive brain stimulation and psychological therapy versus sham brain stimulation or usual care and psychological therapy; pharmacological intervention and psychological therapy with placebo and psychological therapy; pharmacological intervention and non-invasive brain stimulation with placebo and non-invasive brain stimulation; and non-invasive brain stimulation and psychological therapy versus non-invasive brain stimulation and usual care or attention control, with the intention of treating depression after stroke. Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data; we calculated mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous data and risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous data with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), assessed heterogeneity using the I² statistic, and evaluated certainty of evidence according to GRADE. We included 65 trials (72 comparisons) with 5831 participants, with data available for 20 comparisons involving pharmacological interventions, nine for non-invasive brain stimulation, 25 for psychological therapy, three for pharmacological plus psychological therapy, 14 for pharmacological plus non-invasive brain stimulation, and one for non-invasive brain stimulation plus psychological therapy, and no trials for three other comparisons. For pharmacological interventions, very low-certainty evidence from eight trials suggests decreased numbers of people meeting study criteria for depression (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.88; 8 RCTs; 1025 participants) and decreased inadequate response to treatment (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.70; 6 RCTs; 511 participants) compared to placebo, but more adverse events related to the CNS (RR 1.55, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.15; 5 RCTs; 488 participants) and gastrointestinal system (RR 1.62, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.19; 4 RCTs; 473 participants) occurred with pharmacological intervention. For non-invasive brain stimulation, very low-certainty evidence from two trials showed little to no effect on depression or inadequate treatment response compared to sham stimulation. For psychological therapy, very low-certainty evidence from six trials suggests decreased depression prevalence (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.95; 521 participants) compared to usual care/attention control, with no differences in deaths or adverse events. For combined pharmacological and psychological therapy, no trials reported primary outcomes. For pharmacological intervention plus non-invasive brain stimulation, combination therapy reduced depression prevalence (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.91; 3 RCTs; 392 participants; low-certainty evidence) but did not reduce inadequate treatment response (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.30; 3 RCTs; 392 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and very low-certainty evidence from five trials suggested no difference in deaths. No primary outcomes were reported for non-invasive brain stimulation plus psychological therapy. Overall, very low-certainty evidence suggests that pharmacological, psychological, and combination therapies can reduce the prevalence of depression after stroke, while non-invasive brain stimulation has little to no effect, and pharmacological interventions were associated with CNS and gastrointestinal adverse events; more research is required before routine use of such treatments can be recommended.","Do pharmacological treatments, non-invasive brain stimulation (electrodes are placed on the scalp and a finely controlled electric current is applied to change brain activity), psychological treatments, or combination treatments reduce the proportion of people with depression or the extent of depressive symptoms after stroke? Depression is common after stroke yet often is not detected or is inadequately treated. We identified studies by searches conducted on 8 February 2022. This is a living systematic review. We search for new evidence every two months and update the review when we identify relevant new evidence. Please refer to the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for the current status of this review. We included trials that reported on the use of pharmacological, non-invasive brain stimulation, psychological, and combined interventions to treat depression after stroke. We described the main outcomes as the number of people meeting the criteria for depression (scoring above a predefined scoring threshold) and inadequate response (scoring below 50% of the predefined scoring threshold). Average age of participants ranged from 54 to 78 years. Studies were from Asia (39), Europe (12), America (6), South America (1) and Australia (3). We included 65 trials (72 comparisons) involving 5831 participants. Pharmacological treatments resulted in fewer people meeting the study criteria for depression at end of treatment and with inadequate response to treatment. Non-invasive brain stimulation did not reduce the number of people meeting the study criteria for depression at end of treatment and with inadequate response to treatment. Psychological therapy reduced the number of people meeting the study criteria for depression at end of treatment. The combination of pharmacological treatment and non-invasive brain stimulation resulted in fewer people meeting the study criteria for depression but did not affect those with inadequate response to treatment. More people in the pharmacological treatment group reported central nervous system (e.g. confusion, sedation, tremor; in five trials) and gastrointestinal side effects (e.g. constipation, diarrhoea; in four trials) than in the placebo groups. Information on side effects of other treatments was not provided. Estimates of treatment effects were imprecise due to small numbers in most studies and recruitment of people with very different baseline characteristics. We rated the certainty of evidence as low to very low due to these and other limitations in study design. Antidepressant drugs may benefit people with persistent depressive symptoms after stroke, but care is required in their use, as little is known about their effects on overall stroke recovery. Non-invasive brain stimulation may not be of benefit while psychological and combination therapies may offer a treatment option. Future research should include a broader group of people with stroke.",1117,Depression; stroke; pharmacological intervention; non-invasive brain stimulation; psychological therapy; usual care; adverse events,"In assessing the study's outcomes for psychological therapies, which factor stands out as needing more investigation?",What conclusions can be made about the role of non-invasive brain stimulation in treating depression after stroke?,Select all of the following that are colors,What was one of the main motivations for conducting this study?,What types of treatments did the study focus on?,Effectiveness across different ethnic populations.; Unified evaluation metrics for the therapy's efficacy.; Weight loss impacts as a side effect.,Effectiveness across different ethnic populations.; Unified evaluation metrics for the therapy's efficacy.,It is not effective in reducing depressive symptoms.; It consistently reduces the number of depressive cases.; Its effects and implications require further exploration.,It is not effective in reducing depressive symptoms.; Its effects and implications require further exploration.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Depression is often detected after a stroke.; Depression is an important morbidity associated with stroke that is often undetected or inadequately treated.; Stroke recovery is not affected by depression.,Depression is an important morbidity associated with stroke that is often undetected or inadequately treated.,"Pharmacological treatments, non-invasive brain stimulation, psychological therapy, and combination treatments.; Only non-invasive brain stimulation treatments.; Surgical interventions.","Pharmacological treatments, non-invasive brain stimulation, psychological therapy, and combination treatments."

Whether diet, physical activity or both can prevent or delay T2DM and its associated complications in at-risk people is unknown. To assess the effects of diet, physical activity or both on the prevention or delay of T2DM and its associated complications in people at increased risk of developing T2DM.
This is an update of the Cochrane Review published in 2008. We searched the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP Search Portal and reference lists of systematic reviews, articles and health technology assessment reports. The date of the last search of all databases was January 2017. We continuously used a MEDLINE email alert service to identify newly published studies using the same search strategy as described for MEDLINE up to September 2017. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a duration of two years or more. We used standard Cochrane methodology for data collection and analysis. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence using GRADE. We included 12 RCTs randomising 5238 people. One trial contributed 41% of all participants. The duration of the interventions varied from two to six years. We judged none of the included trials at low risk of bias for all 'Risk of bias' domains. Eleven trials compared diet plus physical activity with standard or no treatment. Nine RCTs included participants with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), one RCT included participants with IGT, impaired fasting blood glucose (IFG) or both, and one RCT included people with fasting glucose levels between 5.3 to 6.9 mmol/L. A total of 12 deaths occurred in 2049 participants in the diet plus physical activity groups compared with 10 in 2050 participants in the comparator groups (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.50; 95% prediction interval 0.44 to 2.88; 4099 participants, 10 trials; very low-quality evidence). The definition of T2DM incidence varied among the included trials. Altogether 315 of 2122 diet plus physical activity participants (14.8%) developed T2DM compared with 614 of 2389 comparator participants (25.7%) (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.64; 95% prediction interval 0.50 to 0.65; 4511 participants, 11 trials; moderate-quality evidence). Two trials reported serious adverse events. In one trial no adverse events occurred. In the other trial one of 51 diet plus physical activity participants compared with none of 51 comparator participants experienced a serious adverse event (low-quality evidence). Cardiovascular mortality was rarely reported (four of 1626 diet plus physical activity participants and four of 1637 comparator participants (the RR ranged between 0.94 and 3.16; 3263 participants, 7 trials; very low-quality evidence). Only one trial reported that no non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke had occurred (low-quality evidence). Two trials reported that none of the participants had experienced hypoglycaemia. One trial investigated health-related quality of life in 2144 participants and noted that a minimal important difference between intervention groups was not reached (very low-quality evidence). Three trials evaluated costs of the interventions in 2755 participants. The largest trial of these reported an analysis of costs from the health system perspective and society perspective reflecting USD 31,500 and USD 51,600 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) with diet plus physical activity, respectively (low-quality evidence). There were no data on blindness or end-stage renal disease. One trial compared a diet-only intervention with a physical-activity intervention or standard treatment. The participants had IGT. Three of 130 participants in the diet group compared with none of the 141 participants in the physical activity group died (very low-quality evidence). None of the participants died because of cardiovascular disease (very low-quality evidence). Altogether 57 of 130 diet participants (43.8%) compared with 58 of 141 physical activity participants (41.1%) group developed T2DM (very low-quality evidence). No adverse events were recorded (very low-quality evidence). There were no data on non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, blindness, end-stage renal disease, health-related quality of life or socioeconomic effects. Two trials compared physical activity with standard treatment in 397 participants. One trial included participants with IGT, the other trial included participants with IGT, IFG or both. One trial reported that none of the 141 physical activity participants compared with three of 133 control participants died. The other trial reported that three of 84 physical activity participants and one of 39 control participants died (very low-quality evidence). In one trial T2DM developed in 58 of 141 physical activity participants (41.1%) compared with 90 of 133 control participants (67.7%). In the other trial 10 of 84 physical activity participants (11.9%) compared with seven of 39 control participants (18%) developed T2DM (very low-quality evidence). Serious adverse events were rarely reported (one trial noted no events, one trial described events in three of 66 physical activity participants compared with one of 39 control participants - very low-quality evidence). Only one trial reported on cardiovascular mortality (none of 274 participants died - very low-quality evidence). Non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke were rarely observed in the one trial randomising 123 participants (very low-quality evidence). One trial reported that none of the participants in the trial experienced hypoglycaemia. One trial investigating health-related quality of life in 123 participants showed no substantial differences between intervention groups (very low-quality evidence). There were no data on blindness or socioeconomic effects. There is no firm evidence that diet alone or physical activity alone compared to standard treatment influences the risk of T2DM and especially its associated complications in people at increased risk of developing T2DM. However, diet plus physical activity reduces or delays the incidence of T2DM in people with IGT. Data are lacking for the effect of diet plus physical activity for people with intermediate hyperglycaemia defined by other glycaemic variables. Most RCTs did not investigate patient-important outcomes.","People with moderately elevated blood glucose (often referred to as 'prediabetes') are said to be at an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. It is currently recommended that all people with increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes should adjust their eating habits and physical activity levels. We wanted to find out whether these changes in diet, physical activity or both could prevent or delay type 2 diabetes in people at increased risk. We also wanted to know the effects on patient-important outcomes, such as complications of diabetes (e.g. kidney and eye disease, heart attack, stroke), death from any cause, health-related quality of life (a measure of a person's satisfaction with their life and health) and side-effects. Participants had to have blood glucose levels higher than considered normal, but below the glucose levels that are used to diagnose type 2 diabetes mellitus. We found 12 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) with 5238 participants. The duration of the treatments varied from two years to six years. Most trials included people defined as being at increased risk of type 2 diabetes based on glucose levels measured two hours after ingestion of 75 g of glucose (i.e. 'impaired glucose tolerance' (IGT) after an oral glucose tolerance test). This evidence is up to date as of January 2017. We used a MEDLINE email alert service to identify newly published studies up to September 2017. One study compared diet only with physical activity only. Fifty-seven of 130 participants (44%) in the diet-only group compared with 58 of 141 participants (41%) in the physical activity-only group developed type 2 diabetes. Two studies compared physical activity with standard treatment; in one study 58 of 141 participants (41%) in the physical activity group compared with 90 of 133 participants (68%) in the control group developed type 2 diabetes; in the other study 10 of 84 participants (12%) in the physical activity group compared with seven out of 39 participants (18%) in the control group developed type 2 diabetes. Eleven studies compared diet plus physical activity with standard or no treatment. Diet plus physical activity decreased the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, which occurred in 315 of 2122 participants (15%) in the diet plus physical activity group compared with 614 of 2389 participants (26%) in the standard treatment group. We detected neither an advantage nor a disadvantage of diet, physical activity or both with regard to heart attacks or strokes. Our included studies did not report on complications of diabetes such as kidney or eye disease. The effects on health-related quality of life were inconclusive. Very few participants died in the course of the studies and side-effects were also rare. Future long-term studies should investigate more patient-important outcomes like complications of diabetes, because we do not know for sure whether prediabetes is just a condition arbitrarily defined by a laboratory measurement or is, in fact, a real risk factor for type 2 diabetes mellitus and whether treatment of this condition translates into better patient-important outcomes. All included trials had deficiencies in the way that they were conducted or how key items were reported. For diet plus physical activity compared with standard treatment, we found rather good evidence that the development of new type 2 diabetes was reduced or delayed. For the other comparisons the number of participants was small, resulting in a high risk of random errors (play of chance).",1011,Type 2 diabetes mellitus; randomised controlled trials; impaired glucose tolerance; fasting blood glucose; serious adverse events; cardiovascular mortality; myocardial infarction; non-fatal stroke; hypoglycaemia; health-related quality of life,In what ways could the lack of reported diabetes complications data affect the interpretation of study results?,What was the primary objective of the study?,Select all of the following that are fruits,Describe the effect of diet plus physical activity on developing type 2 diabetes compared with standard treatment.,Identify the outcomes that were not conclusively affected by the interventions.,It may limit understanding of the full benefits of interventions.; It confirms the absence of any complications from diabetes.; It enhances the credibility of the studies by focusing only on T2DM incidence.,It may limit understanding of the full benefits of interventions.,Investigate whether diet and physical activity prevent type 2 diabetes.; Compare different types of medications for type 2 diabetes.; Evaluate the prevalence of type 2 diabetes worldwide.,Investigate whether diet and physical activity prevent type 2 diabetes.,dog; blue; grape,grape,It decreased the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.; It increased the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.; It had no effect on the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.,It decreased the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.,Health-related quality of life.; Blood glucose levels.; Body mass index.,Health-related quality of life.
5ecaf0fa5c1f7f6599d959ff,finetuned_6,Is liraglutide an effective weight-loss treatment for adults living with obesity and does it cause unwanted effects?,"To assess the effects of liraglutide, a GLP-1RA, for adults living with obesity, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and two trials registries on 17 December 2024. Liraglutide likely increases the proportion of people achieving at least 5% weight loss at medium-term follow-up; this effect is likely to be sustained at longer-term follow-up. Medium- or long-term impact on percentage weight change, MACE, quality of life, and mortality may be limited or uncertain. Liraglutide may lead to an increase in adverse events, including serious adverse events in both the medium and long term, which might further limit the sustainability of the initial effects. The drug manufacturer funded 22 studies, raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest. Further independent and long-term studies are needed to better understand the broader effects of liraglutide in the management of obesity.","Obesity is a long-term condition in which a person has too much body fat. It can increase the risk of health problems like type 2 diabetes, diseases of the heart and blood vessels (cardiovascular disease), and some types of cancer. Obesity levels are increasing worldwide, placing a significant burden on healthcare systems. Managing obesity usually involves lifestyle changes such as eating a healthier diet and being more physically active. However, many people find these changes difficult to maintain, and doctors may prescribe medications to support weight loss. Liraglutide is a type of medication that helps people feel full sooner, and so eat less. It was originally developed to treat type 2 diabetes but has been approved in many countries to help people lose weight. It is given as a daily injection. Some people taking liraglutide experience unwanted effects, such as feeling or being sick, diarrhoea and constipation. Liraglutide is a  GLP-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA). Similar medications include semaglutide and tirzepatide. We wanted to know how well liraglutide works in adults with obesity in the medium term (6 to 24 months) and long term (24 months or more). We examined its effects on weight, unwanted effects, obesity-related health problems, quality of life and risk of death. We did not look at what happens after people stop taking liraglutide. We searched for studies that investigated liraglutide for adults living with obesity. Studies could investigate any dose of liraglutide compared with placebo (sham medication), no treatment, lifestyle changes or another weight-loss medication. We included studies in which people took liraglutide for at least 6 months. We compared and analysed the results and assessed our confidence in the evidence. We found 24 studies with 9937 men and women with obesity, aged between 31 and 64 years. Some people had weight-related conditions like diabetes or liver disease. Most studies compared liraglutide with placebo. They mainly took place in high- and middle-income countries. People who took liraglutide were more likely to lose at least 5% of their body weight than those who took a placebo in the medium (18 studies, 6651 people) and long term (2 studies, 1262 people). However, we are uncertain about liraglutide's effects on people's overall percentage weight change from the beginning of the study to the medium term (16 studies, 6050 people) and there may be little to no difference in percentage weight change in the long term (2 studies, 1262 people). In the medium term, people taking liraglutide might experience more unwanted effects of any kind (16 studies, 8147 people) and more serious unwanted effects (20 studies, 8487 people) than those taking placebo. We are unsure about mild-to-moderate unwanted effects (17 studies, 7440 people) or whether unwanted effects caused people to stop treatment (19 studies, 8628 people). In the long term (2 studies, 2640 participants), liraglutide may increase unwanted effects and people may be more likely to stop treatment because of them. We are unsure about unwanted events overall and mild-to-moderate unwanted effects. Liraglutide probably makes little or no difference to quality of life both in the medium term (6 studies, 3733 people) and in the long term (1 study, 863 people). Liraglutide probably makes little or no difference to major cardiovascular events in the medium term (6 studies, 5762 people). We are unsure about its effects on major cardiovascular events in the long term and on deaths in the medium and long term. We are moderately confident that people taking liraglutide lose more weight than those taking placebo. However, our confidence in the other evidence is limited because of how the studies were conducted and information that was missing. Few studies looked at long-term effects or included different people from different places, so the results may not apply to everyone. The manufacturers of liraglutide were involved in the design, conduct or analysis of 22 of the 24 studies, which limits our confidence in the results.

63671bfc81a5eca4218b6417,static_1,Treatments to reduce body temperature to 35C in people who are in hospital after a traumatic brain injury,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and disability, with an estimated 5.5 million people experiencing severe TBI worldwide every year. Observational clinical studies suggest a link between raised body temperature and unfavourable outcomes, though findings are inconsistent. Preclinical models indicate that reducing temperature to 35C to 37.5C may improve biological outcomes compared to deeper cooling (33C). It remains unknown whether reducing body temperature to 35C in people admitted to hospital with TBI is beneficial, neutral, or harmful. This review updates a previous version published in 2014. We aimed to assess the effects of pharmacological or physical interventions designed to reduce body temperature to 35C in adults and children hospitalised after TBI. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, PubMed, clinical trial registers, grey literature, reference lists, and forward citations up to 28 November 2019. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving participants of any age admitted after TBI and receiving interventions intended to lower body temperature within the target range, including medications (paracetamol, NSAIDs) or physical cooling methods (surface cooling devices, bedside fans, cooled intravenous fluids). Eligible comparators were placebo or usual care. Two authors independently assessed studies, extracted data, and evaluated risk of bias, using GRADE to assess certainty of evidence. Only one RCT with 41 adult participants, conducted in two Australian intensive care units, met the criteria. Participants received intravenous paracetamol (1 g every four hours for 72 hours) or a matched placebo. We were uncertain whether paracetamol influenced 28-day mortality (risk ratio 2.86, 95% CI 0.32 to 25.24). The certainty of evidence was very low due to imprecision (small sample size) and selective reporting concerns, although other risks of bias were low. The study did not report the primary outcome of poor outcome at follow-up (death or dependency) or any secondary outcomes of interest, including intracranial or extracranial haemorrhage, abnormal intracranial pressure, or pneumonia or other serious infections. We found one additional completed trial of a physical intervention (advanced fever control using a surface cooling device versus standard fever control in 12 participants), but it was published only as an abstract with insufficient details for inclusion; it is listed as awaiting classification pending further information. Four ongoing trials may contribute data to future updates if they report relevant outcomes and provide separate results for participants with TBI when mixed populations are included. In conclusion, one small study contributed very low-certainty evidence on mortality. Overall uncertainty is driven by extremely limited research on interventions aimed at reducing body temperature to 35C after TBI. More research evaluating both pharmacological and physical interventions is needed. Future studies should include outcomes important to patients, such as side effects (e.g., nausea, vomiting) and discomfort caused by cooling therapies.","Traumatic brain injury occurs when direct force to the headsuch as from a road traffic accident or a fall causes damage to the brain. It is a major global health problem, affecting about 5.5 million people each year. Injury occurs in two stages: first at the moment of impact, and then over the following hours to weeks as secondary damage develops. Treatment aims to limit this secondary damage. Some evidence suggests that people with normal body temperature after injury may have better outcomes than those with elevated temperatures. This review examined whether medicines or non-drug physical cooling methods that reduce body temperature to between 35C improve outcomes for adults or children hospitalized after traumatic brain injury. We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs)the most reliable type of evidence up to 28 November 2019. Only one small RCT with 41 participants was found. It compared intravenous paracetamol, given for 72 hours, with an intravenous salt solution made to look identical. No published trials assessed other medicines or physical cooling methods such as cooling blankets, ice, fans, or cooled fluids. One very small study of physical cooling was identified but lacked enough information for inclusion, and four ongoing studies may provide future evidence. Some of these include mixed types of brain injury, and we will only be able to use them if they report traumatic brain injury results separately. We were uncertain whether paracetamol reduced deaths within 28 days because the study was very small and did not originally plan to report mortality. It also did not report any of our key outcomes, such as poor functional outcome (death or dependency), serious bleeding inside or outside the brain, raised intracranial pressure, pneumonia, or other infections. Although the study methods were generally sound, the lack of pre-specified reporting increased the risk of bias. With only one small study, the certainty of the evidence was very low, meaning the true effects may be very different from what was reported. Overall, we remain uncertain whether medicines or physical cooling treatments that lower body temperature to 35C benefit people in hospital after traumatic brain injury. More and larger studies are needed, and future updates will assess side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and discomfort, which we hope ongoing and future research will report.",1056,Traumatic brain injury; pharmacological interventions; physical cooling methods; certainty of evidence; imprecision; intracranial pressure; extracranial haemorrhage; pneumonia; advanced fever control,What were the motivations for the study's focus on cooling treatments for TBI?,Which factors contributed to the uncertainty of the study results on paracetamol?,Select all of the following that are colors,"Based on the study, what can be concluded about the use of cooling methods in reducing TBI mortality rates?",Explain the main goal of the study in your own words.,Elevated body temperatures suggest potentially worse outcomes for TBI patients.; Normal body temperature is universally accepted to improve brain injury outcomes.; Cooling treatments have been consistently proven in other unrelated medical contexts.,Elevated body temperatures suggest potentially worse outcomes for TBI patients.,The study used a too short duration of treatment.; The small sample size and lack of pre-planned mortality reporting.; The study confirmed that all key outcomes were reported comprehensively.,The small sample size and lack of pre-planned mortality reporting.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,The study provides strong evidence that cooling methods reduce mortality.; Cooling methods' impact on mortality is uncertain due to the study's limited scope.; Mortality rates increase significantly with the use of cooling methods.,Cooling methods' impact on mortality is uncertain due to the study's limited scope.,To determine if cooling to 35-37.5Â°C improves outcomes after TBI; To establish the best surgical intervention for TBI; To identify genetic markers of TBI,To determine if cooling to 35-37.5Â°C improves outcomes after TBI
63671bfc81a5eca4218b6417,static_2,Electrical shocks (electrical cardioversion) and drugs (pharmacological cardioversion) for restoring normal rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most frequent sustained arrhythmia. Cardioversion is a rhythm control strategy to restore normal/sinus rhythm, and can be achieved through drugs (pharmacological) or a synchronised electric shock (electrical cardioversion).
To assess the efficacy and safety of pharmacological and electrical cardioversion for atrial fibrillation (AF), atrial flutter and atrial tachycardias.
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science (CPCI-S) and three trials registers (ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP and ISRCTN) on 14 February 2023.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) at the individual patient level. Patient populations were aged ?  18 years with AF of any type and duration, atrial flutter or other sustained related atrial arrhythmias, not occurring as a result of reversible causes.
We used standard Cochrane methodology to collect data and performed a network meta-analysis using the standard frequentist graph-theoretical approach using the netmeta package in R. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence which we presented in our summary of findings with a judgement on certainty. We calculated differences using risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) as well as ranking treatments using a P value. We assessed clinical and statistical heterogeneity and split the networks for the primary outcome and acute procedural success, due to concerns about violating the transitivity assumption.
We included 112 RCTs (139 records), from which we pooled data from 15,968 patients. The average age ranged from 47 to 72 years and the proportion of male patients ranged from 38% to 92%. Seventy-nine trials were considered to be at high risk of bias for at least one domain, 32 had no high risk of bias domains, but had at least one domain classified as uncertain risk, and one study was considered at low risk for all domains. For paroxysmal AF (35 trials), when compared to placebo, anteroapical (AA)/anteroposterior (AP) biphasic truncated exponential waveform (BTE) cardioversion (RR: 2.42; 95% CI 1.65 to 3.56), quinidine (RR: 2.23; 95% CI 1.49 to 3.34), ibutilide (RR: 2.00; 95% CI 1.28 to 3.12), propafenone (RR: 1.98; 95% CI 1.67 to 2.34), amiodarone (RR: 1.69; 95% CI 1.42 to 2.02), sotalol (RR: 1.58; 95% CI 1.08 to 2.31) and procainamide (RR: 1.49; 95% CI 1.13 to 1.97) likely result in a large increase in maintenance of sinus rhythm until hospital discharge or end of study follow-up (certainty of evidence: moderate). The effect size was larger for AA/AP incremental and was progressively smaller for the subsequent interventions. Despite low certainty of evidence, antazoline may result in a large increase (RR: 28.60; 95% CI 1.77 to 461.30) in this outcome. Similarly, low-certainty evidence suggests a large increase in this outcome for flecainide (RR: 2.17; 95% CI 1.68 to 2.79), vernakalant (RR: 2.13; 95% CI 1.52 to 2.99), and magnesium (RR: 1.73; 95% CI 0.79 to 3.79). For persistent AF (26 trials), one network was created for electrical cardioversion and showed that, when compared to AP BTE incremental energy with patches, AP BTE maximum energy with patches (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.55) likely results in a large increase, and active compression AP BTE incremental energy with patches (RR: 1.14, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.131) likely results in an increase in maintenance of sinus rhythm at hospital discharge or end of study follow-up (certainty of evidence: high). Use of AP BTE incremental with paddles (RR: 1.03, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.09; certainty of evidence: low) may lead to a slight increase, and AP MDS Incremental paddles (RR: 0.95, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.05; certainty of evidence: low) may lead to a slight decrease in efficacy. On the other hand, AP MDS incremental energy using patches (RR: 0.78, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.87), AA RBW incremental energy with patches (RR: 0.76, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.88), AP RBW incremental energy with patches (RR: 0.76, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.86), AA MDS incremental energy with patches (RR: 0.76, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.86) and AA MDS incremental energy with paddles (RR: 0.68, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.83) probably result in a decrease in this outcome when compared to AP BTE incremental energy with patches (certainty of evidence: moderate). The network for pharmacological cardioversion showed that bepridil (RR: 2.29, 95% CI 1.26 to 4.17) and quindine (RR: 1.53, (95% CI 1.01 to 2.32) probably result in a large increase in maintenance of sinus rhythm at hospital discharge or end of study follow-up when compared to amiodarone (certainty of evidence: moderate). Dofetilide (RR: 0.79, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.44), sotalol (RR: 0.89, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.18), propafenone (RR: 0.79, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.25) and pilsicainide (RR: 0.39, 95% CI 0.02 to 7.01) may result in a reduction in this outcome when compared to amiodarone, but the certainty of evidence is low. For atrial flutter (14 trials), a network could be created only for antiarrhythmic drugs. Using placebo as the common comparator, ibutilide (RR: 21.45, 95% CI 4.41 to 104.37), propafenone (RR: 7.15, 95% CI 1.27 to 40.10), dofetilide (RR: 6.43, 95% CI 1.38 to 29.91), and sotalol (RR: 6.39, 95% CI 1.03 to 39.78) probably result in a large increase in the maintenance of sinus rhythm at hospital discharge or end of study follow-up (certainty of evidence: moderate), and procainamide (RR: 4.29, 95% CI 0.63 to 29.03), flecainide (RR 3.57, 95% CI 0.24 to 52.30) and vernakalant (RR: 1.18, 95% CI 0.05 to 27.37) may result in a large increase in maintenance of sinus rhythm at hospital discharge or end of study follow-up (certainty of evidence: low). All tested electrical cardioversion strategies for atrial flutter had very high efficacy (97.9% to 100%). The rate of mortality (14 deaths) and stroke or systemic embolism (3 events) at 30 days was extremely low. Data on quality of life were scarce and of uncertain clinical significance. No information was available regarding heart failure readmissions. Data on duration of hospitalisation was scarce, of low quality, and could not be pooled.
Despite the low quality of evidence, this systematic review provides important information on electrical and pharmacological strategies to help patients and physicians deal with AF and atrial flutter. In the assessment of the patient comorbidity profile, antiarrhythmic drug onset of action and side effect profile versus the need for a physician with experience in sedation, or anaesthetics support for electrical cardioversion are key aspects when choosing the cardioversion method.","AF is the most frequent abnormal heart rhythm seen in the world. Patients with this condition may feel their heart beating rapidly and irregularly. This can occur for separate brief or long episodes (paroxysmal AF) or it may become continuous (persistent AF). Atrial flutter is a similar abnormal rhythm that causes similar symptoms, can cause episodes of variable duration and can also become continuous.
Cardioversion is a treatment to restore the rhythm of the heart back to normal (sinus rhythm).
We wanted to know if delivering a controlled electrical shock (i.e. electrical cardioversion) and drugs (i.e. pharmacological cardioversion) are effective and safe when restoring heart rhythm back to normal.
We searched for studies that investigated electrical and pharmacological cardioversion compared to each other or placebo (a medicine that looks like the real medicine but that has no active ingredient).
We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our trust in these results, based on factors such as study methods and size.
We found 112 studies. We were able to combine and analyse the results from 72 studies, with 15,968 participants aged between 47 and 72 years. Thirty-five studies included patients with paroxysmal AF (AF that terminates spontaneously or with intervention within 7 days of onset), 26 studies of patients with persistent AF (AF that is continuously sustained beyond seven days, including episodes terminated by cardioversion after ? 7 days), and 14 trials included patients with atrial flutter. The remaining included a mix of paroxysmal, persistent AF and atrial flutter.
For patients with paroxysmal AF, electrical cardioversion with biphasic incremental energy, fast-acting drugs like intravenous vernakalant, flecainide, ibutilide and antazoline, and slower-acting and/or oral drugs such as quinidine, propafenone, amiodarone and sotalol are effective at restoring sinus rhythm.
For patients with persistent AF, electrical cardioversion with biphasic energy seems to be the most effective option; bepridil, quinidine and amiodarone tablets may also be effective in selected cases.
For patients with atrial flutter, electrical cardioversion followed by dofetilide are the most effective options.
The risk of death and stroke is very low for patients having cardioversion procedures.
Malignant arrhythmias (torsade de pointes, sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, all of which are associated with high 1-year mortality rate) were observed for dofetilide, ibutilide, sotalol, quinidine and vernakalant, justifying the need for special care and closer monitoring when using these drugs. Duration of hospitalisation data was available in three studies but, as there were variable timings in these studies, we could not combine them to assess their joint effectiveness. These studies suggest that the duration of hospitalisation may be lower with electrical cardioversion.
Heart failure was observed in some patients treated with propafenone, flecainide, sotalol, amiodarone, vernakalant, and placebo, and was not observed in patients receiving electrical cardioversion, suggesting that the latter approach should be the preferred one if concerns exist regarding the occurrence of this outcome.
Phlebitis (i.e. inflammation of the vein caused by using injectable drugs) occurred frequently in patients treated with amiodarone, and dysgeusia (i.e. impairment of the sense of taste) and sneezing occurred frequently in patients receiving vernakalant.
We are sure or moderately sure of the results for the efficacy of treatments available for persistent AF and atrial flutter. We are less sure about the results for some of the treatment options for paroxysmal AF.
Not enough data are available regarding quality of life, and data were limited regarding duration of hospital stay.

63671bfc81a5eca4218b6417,static_2,Integrated compared with non-integrated orbital implants for treating anophthalmic sockets,"Anophthalmia is the absence of one or both eyes, and it can be congenital (i.e. a birth defect) or acquired later in life. There are two main types of orbital implant: integrated, whereby the implant receives a blood supply from the body that allows for the integration of the prosthesis within the tissue; and non-integrated, where the implant remains separate. Despite the remarkable progress in anophthalmic socket reconstruction and in the development of various types of implants, there are still uncertainties about the real roles of integrated (hydroxyapatite (HA), porous polyethylene (PP), composites) and non-integrated (polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA)/acrylic and silicone) orbital implants in anophthalmic socket treatment.
To assess the effects of integrated versus non-integrated orbital implants for treating anophthalmic sockets.
We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2016, Issue 7), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to August 2016), Embase (January 1980 to August 2016), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (1982 to August 2016), the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov), and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 8 August 2016.
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of integrated and non-integrated orbital implants for treating anophthalmic sockets.
Two authors independently selected relevant trials, assessed methodological quality and extracted data.
We included three studies with a total of 284 participants (250 included in analysis). The studies were conducted in India, Iran and the Netherlands. The three studies were clinically heterogenous, comparing different materials and using different surgical techniques. None of the included studies used a peg (i.e. a fixing pin used to connect the implant to the prosthesis). In general the trials were poorly reported, and we judged them to be at unclear risk of bias. One trial compared HA using traditional enucleation versus alloplastic implantation using evisceration (N = 100). This trial was probably not masked. The second trial compared PP with scleral cap enucleation versus PMMA with either myoconjunctival or traditional enucleation (N = 150). Although participants were not masked, outcome assessors were. The last trial compared HA and acrylic using the enucleation technique (N = 34) but did not report comparative effectiveness data. In the trial comparing HA versus alloplastic implantation, there was no evidence of any difference between the two groups with respect to the proportion of successful procedures at one year (risk ratio (RR) 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95 to 1.09, N = 100, low-certainty evidence). People receiving HA had slightly worse horizontal implant mobility compared to the alloplastic group (mean difference (MD) -3.35 mm, 95% CI - 4.08 to - 2.62, very low-certainty evidence) and slightly worse vertical implant motility (MD -2.76 mm, 95% CI -3.45 to -2.07, very low-certainty evidence). As different techniques were used - enucleation versus evisceration - it is not clear whether these differences in implant motility can be attributed solely to the type of material. Investigators did not report adverse events. In the trial comparing PP versus PMMA, there was no evidence of any difference between the two groups with respect to the proportion of successful procedures at one year (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.01, N = 150, low-certainty evidence). There was very low-certainty evidence of a difference in horizontal implant motility depending on whether PP was compared to PMMA with traditional enucleation (MD 1.96 mm, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.91) or PMMA with myoconjunctival enucleation (-0.57 mm, 95% CI -1.63 to 0.49). Similarly, for vertical implant motility, there was very low-certainty evidence of a difference in the comparison of PP to PMMA traditional (MD 3.12 mm 95% CI 2.36 to 3.88) but no evidence of a difference when comparing PP to PMMA myoconjunctival (MD -0.20 mm 95% CI  -1.28 to 0.88). Four people in the PP group (total N = 50) experienced adverse events (i.e. exposures) compared to 6/100 in the PMMA groups (RR 17.82, 95% CI 0.98 to 324.67, N = 150, very low-certainty evidence). None of the studies reported socket sphere size, cosmetic effect or quality of life measures.
Current very low-certainty evidence from three small published randomised controlled trials did not provide sufficient evidence to assess the effect of integrated and non-integrated material orbital implants for treating anophthalmic sockets. This review underlines the need to conduct further well-designed trials in this field.","The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out if integrated orbital implants are better than non-integrated orbital implants for treating anophthalmic sockets. Cochrane researchers collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found three studies.
There is uncertainty as to the benefits and harms of integrated compared with non-integrated orbital implants. What was studied in the review? 'Anophthalmia' is the absence of the eye in the orbit. This can occur in childhood (because of problems with development) or it can happen during the course of life (due to an accident or other eye disease).
Doctors can put an implant in the orbit to fill the void left by the removal of the eye and this together with an external prosthesis can improve the patient's appearance. This orbital implant can be made of two types of materials - integrated or non-integrated material. If the material is integrated, then new blood vessels can grow into the implant material. If the material is non-integrated, then the orbital implant remains separate from the rest of the orbit's tissue.
The review authors looked to see if the type of implant material affected the success of the surgery or, in other words, if integrated implants can provide better results than non-integrated implants. They were also interested in how much the external prosthesis could move better after surgery - using integrated or non-integrated orbital implants. Also, the authors wanted to know if the type of orbital implant material can affect people's quality of life. Were there any adverse (harmful) effects of using integrated or non-integrated orbital implants?
The type of material used for the orbital implant may not affect the success of the surgery (low-certainty evidence). The review authors judged the evidence on prosthesis movement and adverse effects as providing very little certainty about the true effects. There was no information on quality of life.

63671bfc81a5eca4218b6417,interactive_3,What are the benefits and risks of cognitive rehabilitation for people with mild-to-moderate dementia?,"Cognitive impairments affect functional ability in people with dementia. Cognitive rehabilitation (CR) is a personalised, solution-focused approach that aims to enable people with mild-to-moderate dementia to manage everyday activities and maintain as much independence as possible. To evaluate the effects of CR on everyday functioning and other outcomes for people with mild-to-moderate dementia, and on outcomes for care partners. To identify and explore factors that may be associated with the efficacy of CR. We searched the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialised Register, which contains records from MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, LILACS, and other clinical trial databases, and grey literature sources. The most recent search was completed on 19 October 2022. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing CR with control conditions and reporting relevant outcomes for the person with dementia and/or the care partner. We extracted relevant data from published manuscripts and contacted trial authors if necessary. Within each of the comparisons, we pooled data for each outcome of interest and conducted inverse-variance, random-effects meta-analyses. We evaluated the certainty of the evidence using GRADEpro GDT. We identified six eligible RCTs published in English between 2010 and 2022, which together included 1702 participants. The mean age of participants ranged from 76 to 80 and the proportion of male participants was between 29.4% and 79.3%. Most participants, in the studies where the type of dementia was reported, had a diagnosis of Alzheimers disease (AD; n = 1002, 58.9% of the whole sample, 81.2% of the participants for whom the specific diagnosis was reported). Risk of bias in the individual studies was relatively low. The exception was a high risk of bias in relation to blinding of participants and practitioners, which is not usually feasible with psychosocial interventions. Our primary outcome of everyday functioning was operationalised in the included studies as goal attainment in relation to activities targeted in the intervention. For our main comparison of CR with usual care, we pooled data for goal attainment evaluated from three perspectives (self-rating of performance, informant rating of performance, and self-rating of satisfaction with performance) at end of treatment and at medium-term follow-up (3 to 12 months). We could also pool data at these time points for 20 and 19 secondary outcomes respectively. The review findings were strongly driven by one large, high-quality RCT. We found high-certainty evidence of large positive effects of CR on all three primary outcome perspectives at the end of treatment: participant self-ratings of goal attainment (standardised mean difference (SMD) 1.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.26 to 1.66; I2 = 0%; 3 RCTs, 501 participants), informant ratings of goal attainment (SMD 1.61, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.21; I2 = 41%; 3 RCTs, 476 participants), and self-ratings of satisfaction with goal attainment (SMD 1.31, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.54; I2 = 5%; 3 RCTs, 501 participants), relative to an inactive control condition. At medium-term follow-up, we found high-certainty evidence showing a large positive effect of CR on all three primary outcome perspectives: participant self-ratings of goal attainment (SMD 1.46, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.68; I2 = 0%; 2 RCTs, 432 participants), informant ratings of goal attainment (SMD 1.25, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.72; I2 = 29%; 3 RCTs, 446 participants), and self-ratings of satisfaction with goal attainment (SMD 1.19, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.66; I2 = 28%; 2 RCTs, 432 participants), relative to an inactive control condition. For participants at the end of treatment we found high-certainty evidence showing a small positive effect of CR on self-efficacy (2 RCTs, 456 participants) and immediate recall (2 RCTs, 459 participants). For participants at medium-term follow-up we found moderate-certainty evidence showing a small positive effect of CR on auditory selective attention (2 RCTs, 386 participants), and a small negative effect on general functional ability (3 RCTs, 673 participants), and we found low-certainty evidence showing a small positive effect on sustained attention (2 RCTs, 413 participants), and a small negative effect on memory (2 RCTs, 51 participants) and anxiety (3 RCTs, 455 participants). We found moderate- and low-certainty evidence indicating that at the end of treatment CR had negligible effects on participant anxiety, quality of life, sustained attention, memory, delayed recall, and general functional ability, and at medium-term follow-up on participant self-efficacy, depression, quality of life, immediate recall, and verbal fluency. For care partners at the end of treatment we found low-certainty evidence showing a small positive effect on environmental aspects of quality of life (3 RCTs, 465 care partners), and small negative effects of CR on level of depression (2 RCTs, 32 care partners) and on psychological wellbeing (2 RCTs, 388 care partners). For care partners at medium-term follow-up we found high-certainty evidence showing a small positive effect of CR on social aspects of quality of life (3 RCTs, 436 care partners) and moderate-certainty evidence showing a small positive effect on psychological aspects of quality of life (3 RCTs, 437 care partners). We found moderate- and low-certainty evidence at the end of treatment that CR had negligible effects on care partners physical health, psychological and social aspects of quality of life, and stress, and at medium-term follow-up for the physical health aspect of care partners quality of life and psychological wellbeing. CR is helpful in enabling people with mild or moderate dementia to improve their ability to manage the everyday activities targeted in the intervention. Confidence in these findings could be strengthened if more high-quality studies contributed to the observed effects. The available evidence suggests that CR can form a valuable part of a clinical toolkit to assist people with dementia in overcoming some of the everyday barriers imposed by cognitive and functional difficulties. Future research, including process evaluation studies, could help identify avenues to maximise CR effects and achieve wider impacts on functional ability and wellbeing.","Dementia is a group of symptoms caused by changes in the brain that get worse over time. People with some types of dementia have difficulties with memory, planning, concentrating, and communicating. These and other thinking difficulties are collectively described by the umbrella term, 'cognitive impairment'. Cognitive impairment makes it harder to do daily activities and stay independent for as long as possible.
Cognitive rehabilitation is a personalised intervention. People have one-to-one sessions with a practitioner, usually in their own home. People identify everyday activities and tasks that they would like to manage better or do more independently. The practitioner suggests strategies and works with them to help achieve these improvements in the activities that are important to them. Family members are often involved as well.
We explored whether cognitive rehabilitation was better than usual treatment for: doing a chosen task or activity that matters to the person; managing daily activities; feeling confident about being able to manage things; feeling depressed or anxious; having a sense of wellbeing. We also explored whether cognitive rehabilitation was better for ensuring the wellbeing of the care partner - usually a husband, wife, or other close family member.
We searched for studies that rigorously tested the effects of cognitive rehabilitation for people with mild-to-moderate dementia. In these studies, some people had their usual treatment and others had their usual treatment plus cognitive rehabilitation. This made it possible to see whether cognitive rehabilitation was more helpful than usual treatment alone. We compared and summarised the results of the studies. We rated our confidence in the evidence the studies provided, based on the methods used and the numbers of people involved. We found six studies. They involved 1702 people with mild-to-moderate dementia, who had between 8 and 14 sessions with a cognitive rehabilitation practitioner. Alzheimers disease was the most common dementia diagnosis (59% of all participants, 82% of participants with the specific diagnosis reported).
The main findings are that, compared to people who just had their usual treatment, people who had cognitive rehabilitation got better at doing their chosen tasks or activities.
This improvement was seen by the people with dementia and by their care partners. The improvement was seen straight after cognitive rehabilitation and was still noticeable 3 to 12 months later.
Straight after cognitive rehabilitation, compared to people who just had their usual treatment, people with dementia may feel more confident about how they are managing.
There might not be any differences in the wellbeing of people with dementia and their care partners. We are not sure if there are any differences for people with dementia in managing other tasks or activities or in feeling depressed. Three to 12 months after cognitive rehabilitation, compared to usual treatment, care partners may have better psychological wellbeing.
There may not be any differences in how well people with dementia manage other tasks or activities, in how confident or depressed they feel, or in their wellbeing.
Our review included six studies, but the findings are based mostly on information from one large study. We do not know if the effects of cognitive rehabilitation last more than a year. Results for several effects of cognitive rehabilitation were not clear.",1125,Cognitive rehabilitation; dementia; goal attainment; Alzheimerâs disease; psychological wellbeing; quality of life; environmental aspects; social aspects; psychosocial interventions,What conclusions can be drawn about the influence of CR on the confidence of people with dementia after intervention?,How might the engagement of care partners in CR sessions impact the effectiveness of the intervention?,Select the items that are animals,What are the implications of CR's effects on the psychological wellbeing of care partners after 3 to 12 months?,How is the success of cognitive rehabilitation measured?,CR significantly boosts confidence immediately after intervention.; CR has no impact on confidence compared to usual treatment.; CR decreases confidence in managing daily activities.,CR significantly boosts confidence immediately after intervention.,Involving care partners might enhance the perceived effectiveness of CR.; Care partners' involvement potentially disrupts the CR process.; Care partners have no influence on the outcomes of CR.,Involving care partners might enhance the perceived effectiveness of CR.,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,CR likely improves the psychological wellbeing of care partners.; There is clear evidence that CR increases stress for care partners.; CR has minimal or no impact on care partners' psychological wellbeing.,CR likely improves the psychological wellbeing of care partners.,By the increase in brain size; By improvement in chosen tasks or activities; By the reduction of medication,By improvement in chosen tasks or activities
63671bfc81a5eca4218b6417,interactive_4,Music therapy for depression,"Depression is a highly prevalent mood disorder that is characterised by persistent low mood, diminished interest, and loss of pleasure, and music therapy may be helpful in modulating moods and emotions; an update of the 2008 Cochrane review was needed to improve knowledge on effects of music therapy for depression. The objectives were: 1. To assess effects of music therapy for depression in people of any age compared with treatment as usual (TAU) and psychological, pharmacological, and/or other therapies; and 2. To compare effects of different forms of music therapy for people of any age with a diagnosis of depression. We searched the following databases: the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (CCMD-CTR; from inception to 6 May 2016); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; to 17 June 2016); Thomson Reuters/Web of Science (to 21 June 2016); Ebsco/PsycInfo, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Embase, and PubMed (to 5 July 2016); the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), ClinicalTrials.gov, the National Guideline Clearing House, and OpenGrey (to 6 September 2016); and the Digital Access to Research Theses (DART)-Europe E-theses Portal, Open Access Theses and Dissertations, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Database (to 7 September 2016); we checked reference lists of retrieved articles and relevant systematic reviews and contacted trialists and subject experts for additional information when needed; we updated this search in August 2017 and placed potentially relevant studies in the ""Awaiting classification"" section, and we will incorporate these into the next version of this review as appropriate. All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) comparing music therapy versus treatment as usual (TAU), psychological therapies, pharmacological therapies, other therapies, or different forms of music therapy for reducing depression were included. Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data from all included studies, and we calculated standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous data and odds ratio (OR) for dichotomous data with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and assessed heterogeneity using the I2 statistic. We included in this review nine studies involving a total of 421 participants, 411 of whom were included in the meta-analysis examining short-term effects of music therapy for depression; concerning primary outcomes, we found moderate-quality evidence of large effects favouring music therapy and TAU over TAU alone for both clinician-rated depressive symptoms (SMD -0.98, 95% CI -1.69 to -0.27, 3 RCTs, 1 CCT, n = 219) and patient-reported depressive symptoms (SMD -0.85, 95% CI -1.37 to -0.34, 3 RCTs, 1 CCT, n = 142), and music therapy was not associated with more or fewer adverse events than TAU. Regarding secondary outcomes, music therapy plus TAU was superior to TAU alone for anxiety and functioning, while music therapy and TAU was not more effective than TAU alone for improved quality of life (SMD 0.32, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.80, P = 0.20, n = 67, low-quality evidence); we found no significant discrepancies in the numbers of participants who left the study early (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.70, P = 0.26, 5 RCTs, 1 CCT, n = 293, moderate-quality evidence). Findings of the present meta-analysis indicate that music therapy added to TAU provides short-term beneficial effects for people with depression if compared to TAU alone; additionally, we are uncertain about the effects of music therapy versus psychological therapies on clinician-rated depression (SMD -0.78, 95% CI -2.36 to 0.81, 1 RCT, n = 11, very low-quality evidence), patient-reported depressive symptoms (SMD -1.28, 95% CI -3.75 to 1.02, 4 RCTs, n = 131, low-quality evidence), quality of life (SMD -1.31, 95% CI -0.36 to 2.99, 1 RCT, n = 11, very low-quality evidence), and leaving the study early (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.49, 4 RCTs, n = 157, moderate-quality evidence), and we found no eligible evidence addressing adverse events, functioning, and anxiety. We do not know whether one form of music therapy is better than another for clinician-rated depressive symptoms (SMD -0.52, 95% CI -1.87 to 0.83, 1 RCT, n = 9, very low-quality evidence), patient-reported depressive symptoms (SMD -0.01, 95% CI -1.33 to 1.30, 1 RCT, n = 9, very low-quality evidence), quality of life (SMD -0.24, 95% CI -1.57 to 1.08, 1 RCT, n = 9, very low-quality evidence), or leaving the study early (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.46, 1 RCT, n = 10), and we found no eligible evidence addressing adverse events, functioning, or anxiety. Findings of the present meta-analysis indicate that music therapy provides short-term beneficial effects for people with depression, and music therapy added to treatment as usual (TAU) seems to improve depressive symptoms compared with TAU alone; additionally, music therapy plus TAU is not associated with more or fewer adverse events than TAU alone, and music therapy also shows efficacy in decreasing anxiety levels and improving functioning of depressed individuals. Future trials based on adequate design and larger samples of children and adolescents are needed to consolidate our findings, and researchers should consider investigating mechanisms of music therapy for depression, and it is important to clearly describe music therapy, TAU, the comparator condition, and the profession of the person who delivers the intervention, for reproducibility and comparison purposes.","Depression is a common problem that causes changes in mood and loss of interest and pleasure, and music therapy, an intervention that involves regular meetings with a qualified music therapist, may help in improving mood through emotional expression; this review might add new information about effects of music therapy in depressed individuals. Our review will be of interest for the following people: people with depression and their families, friends, and carers; general practitioners, psychiatrists, psychologists, and other professionals working in mental health; music therapists working in mental health; and mental health policy makers. The review aims to answer the following questions: 1. Is music therapy more effective than treatment as usual alone or psychological therapy? 2. Is any form of music therapy better than another form of music therapy? We included nine studies with a total of 421 people of any age group (from adolescents to older people). Studies compared effects of music therapy versus treatment as usual, and versus psychological therapy, and additionally examined the differences between two forms of music therapy: active (where people sing or play music) and receptive (where people listen to music). We found that music therapy plus treatment as usual is more effective than treatment as usual alone, and music therapy seems to reduce depressive symptoms and anxiety and helps to improve functioning (e.g. maintaining involvement in job, activities, and relationships). We are not sure whether music therapy is better than psychological therapy, and we do not know whether one form of music therapy is better than another; the small numbers of identified studies and participants make it hard to be confident about these comparisons. Music therapy for depression is likely to be effective for people in decreasing symptoms of depression and anxiety, and it also helps people to function in their everyday life; however, our findings are not complete and need to be clarified through additional research. Future trials should study depression in children and adolescents, and future trial reports should thoroughly describe music therapy interventions, other interventions, and the person who delivers these interventions.",1113,Depression; Mood disorder; Music therapy; Treatment as usual (TAU); Psychological therapies; Pharmacological therapies; Clinician-rated depressive symptoms; Patient-reported depressive symptoms; Adverse events,What might be the reasons for conducting an update of the 2008 Cochrane review on music therapy for depression?,How can the effectiveness of music therapy compared to psychological therapy be critically evaluated based on the summary's findings?,Select all of the following that are colors,What conclusions can be drawn about the types of music therapy evaluated in the study?,Summarize the effect of music therapy when added to treatment as usual.,To assess if music therapy has become more effective over time.; To explore new techniques in music therapy that have emerged since 2008.; To verify the existence of music therapy as a recognized intervention for depression.,To assess if music therapy has become more effective over time.; To explore new techniques in music therapy that have emerged since 2008.,By considering the large sample size of the studies compared.; By acknowledging the uncertainty due to small numbers of studies and participants.; By assuming music therapy is less effective based on the summary's statement.,By acknowledging the uncertainty due to small numbers of studies and participants.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Active music therapy was found superior to receptive music therapy.; There is insufficient evidence to determine if one form is better than another.; Receptive music therapy showed unique benefits not observed in active music therapy.,There is insufficient evidence to determine if one form is better than another.,It reduces depressive symptoms; It has no effect on anxiety; It improves daily functioning,It reduces depressive symptoms; It improves daily functioning
63671bfc81a5eca4218b6417,interactive_4,Are exercises for strengthening breathing muscles effective for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease?,"Inspiratory muscle training (IMT) aims to improve respiratory muscle strength and endurance. Clinical trials have used different training protocols, devices, and respiratory measurements to assess its effectiveness. Current guidelines suggest a possible benefit of IMT, particularly in people with respiratory muscle weakness, but it remains unclear how clinically useful IMT is, especially when combined with pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). We evaluated the effect of IMT on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), both as a stand-alone intervention and when combined with PR. We searched major medical databases and clinical trial registries up to 20 October 2022 and reviewed reference lists of relevant studies. We included randomized controlled trials comparing IMT plus PR versus PR alone, and IMT versus control or sham, using any type of IMT delivery. We excluded trials using resistive devices without breathing-pattern control or with training loads under 30% of maximal inspiratory pressure. Standard Cochrane methods and the RoB 2 tool were used. Primary outcomes included dyspnea, functional exercise capacity, and health-related quality of life. We included 55 RCTs. Interventions varied widely in duration, training load, devices, session frequency, and PR program structure. Only eight trials had low risk of bias. In the comparison of PR plus IMT versus PR alone, we found 22 trials with 1446 participants. IMT added to PR did not improve dyspnea on the Borg scale or the mMRC scale, and effects did not reach clinically meaningful differences. The 6-minute walk distance increased by 5.95 meters but did not reach the threshold for clinical improvement. Subgroup analyses showed no significant differences based on training duration or baseline inspiratory pressure. St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire and COPD Assessment Test scores also did not show clinically meaningful improvements. PImax increased by 11.46 cmH?O but did not meet the minimum clinically important difference, and subgroup analyses again showed no clear modifiers of effect. One abstract reported minor, self-limited adverse effects. In the comparison of IMT versus control or sham, 37 trials with 1021 participants were included. IMT showed a trend toward improved Borg dyspnea scores, but evidence quality was very low. Eight studies using the BDI-TDI showed improvement only in the TDI total score. mMRC scores suggested possible improvement. IMT improved 6-minute walk distance by 35.71 meters, reaching moderate-certainty evidence. SGRQ total scores showed a modest effect in favor of IMT, but evidence was very low. CAT scores improved with IMT. PImax increased by 14.57 cmH?O but did not reach the clinically important threshold. Subgroup analyses again did not identify clear effect modifiers. No included trials reported adverse events. IMT may not improve dyspnea, functional exercise capacity, or quality of life when combined with PR, but IMT alone is likely to improve these outcomes. Whether greater effects occur in people with respiratory muscle weakness or with longer training durations remains uncertain.","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung condition in which the airways become blocked, causing shortness of breath and coughing. It typically develops after long-term exposure to irritating gases such as cigarette smoke and industrial chemicals. Strengthening the breathing muscles is thought to improve airflow and ease symptoms. Health professionals use different exercise approaches to help manage COPD. Some people follow general exercise and education programs to reduce symptoms and improve fitness and quality of life. Others perform breathing exercises using devices that strengthen the diaphragm and rib muscles by adding resistance; this is called inspiratory muscle training (IMT). These devices are also used by people with healthy lungs to improve athletic performance. We wanted to find out whether exercise combined with IMT works better than exercise alone, and whether IMT works better than no training or sham IMT, in improving breathlessness, physical fitness, and quality of life. (A sham device looks real but has no training effect, allowing a fair comparison.) We also wanted to check whether IMT causes any unwanted effects. We searched for studies comparing exercise plus IMT versus exercise alone, and IMT versus no training or sham IMT, then summarized the findings and evaluated the quality of the evidence. We found 22 studies with 1446 participants lasting from 2 to 24 weeks that compared exercise plus IMT to exercise alone. Exercise programs varied widely some used treadmill-only or cycling-only sessions, while others combined treadmill and cycling with muscle strengthening, stair climbing, and education. IMT devices and training durations also varied. Overall, adding IMT to exercise probably makes little to no difference in breathlessness, has unknown effects on physical fitness, may make little to no difference in quality of life, and probably makes little to no difference in breathing muscle strength. We also found 37 studies with 1021 participants lasting from 2 weeks to a year that compared IMT alone with no training or sham IMT. IMT protocols varied in devices, resistance levels, frequency, and supervision. IMT alone may reduce breathlessness on one measurement scale but shows unclear effects on two others; it probably improves physical fitness; it probably improves quality of life on one scale but shows unclear benefits on another; and it may make little to no difference to breathing muscle strength. These findings are limited by differences in training duration, devices, resistance levels, frequency of sessions, and exercise programs. Many studies were small, and some participants may have known which treatment they received. Because of this variability, our confidence in the overall conclusions is reduced.",1073,Inspiratory muscle training; respiratory muscle strength; pulmonary rehabilitation; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; resistive devices; dyspnea; Borg scale; mMRC scale; PImax; BDI-TDI,What was the main goal of the study?,Which condition was primarily targeted in the study?,Select the items that are animals,What did the study evaluate about IMT combined with exercise?,Explain the difference between IMT alone and combined with exercise in the context of this study.,To determine if IMT reduces breathlessness.; To assess the sales of IMT devices.; To train health professionals in IMT.,To determine if IMT reduces breathlessness.,Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).; Asthma.; Lung cancer.,Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,"Improvement in breathlessness, physical fitness, and quality of life.; Suitability for treating asthma.; Effects on cognitive function.","Improvement in breathlessness, physical fitness, and quality of life.","IMT alone may improve breathlessness and fitness, but combining it with exercise may offer little additional benefit.; IMT alone is better for mental health, whereas exercise improves lung capacity.; IMT combined with exercise improves bone density.","IMT alone may improve breathlessness and fitness, but combining it with exercise may offer little additional benefit."
63671bfc81a5eca4218b6417,finetuned_5,What were the unintended consequences of school-based measures to manage the COVID-19 pandemic?,"Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, schools were a key setting for intervening with public health and social measures (PHSM) to reduce transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Consequently, there is a need to assess the varied unintended consequences associated with PHSM implemented in the school setting, for students, teachers, and school staff, as well as for families and the wider community. This is an update of a Cochrane scoping review first published in 2022. To comprehensively identify and summarise the published literature on the unintended consequences of public health and social measures implemented in the school setting to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2. This will serve to identify critical knowledge gaps to inform future primary research and systematic reviews. It may also serve as a resource for future pandemic management. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, PsycINFO, ERIC, and Web of Science on 5 and 6 January 2023. We also searched two COVID-19-specific databases (Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease). Finally, we reviewed the included studies of all relevant systematic reviews and guidelines identified through the searches. We included studies that empirically assessed the impact of PHSM implemented in the school setting to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2. We imposed no restrictions with regard to the types of populations and specific interventions. Outcomes of interest were consequences that were measured or experienced, but not anticipated consequences. This review focused on real-world evidence: empirical quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-method studies were eligible for inclusion, but modelling studies were ineligible. The review was guided by a logic model. In line with the latest Cochrane effectiveness review of school measures to contain COVID-19 and a conceptual framework of PHSM, this logic model distinguishes between measures to make contacts safer (related to individual protection and the physical environment), measures to reduce contacts (related to social interactions, movement, and services) and surveillance and response measures. Unintended consequences comprise the following categories: health and well-being, health system and social welfare services, human and fundamental rights, acceptability and adherence, equality and equity, social and institutional, economic and resource, and ecological. The review team screened all titles and abstracts, then potentially eligible full-text articles, in duplicate. Across the included studies, we summarised and presented types of measures, consequences, and study designs using the predefined categories of the logic model, while allowing for emerging categories. We included 60 studies (57 new to this update) from 25 countries. There were 31 quantitative studies, 17 qualitative studies, and 12 mixed-method studies. Most targeted either students (26 studies), teachers and school staff (11 studies), or students and school staff (12 studies). Others evaluated measures aimed at parents (2 studies), staff and parents (1 study), students and teachers (3 studies), or the whole school (5 studies). The measures were related to individual protection (26 studies), the physical environment (20 studies), social interactions (25 studies), services (1 study), movement (3 studies), surveillance (9 studies) and response (7 studies). Nine studies evaluated the combined effect of multiple measures. The main consequences assessed were from the categories health and well-being (29 studies), acceptability and adherence (31 studies), and social and institutional (23 studies). Fewer studies covered consequences from the categories equality and equity (2 studies), economic and resource (7 studies), and ecological (1 study). No studies examined consequences for the health system and social welfare services or for human and fundamental rights. This scoping review provides an overview of the evidence on the unintended consequences of PHSM implemented in the school setting to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2. The 60 included studies describe a broad body of evidence and cover a range of measures and unintended consequences, primarily consequences for health and well-being, acceptability and adherence, social and institutional aspects, and economic aspects. The main gaps identified relate to consequences of school measures for the health system and social welfare services, human and fundamental rights, equality and equity, and the environment. Further research is needed to fill these gaps, making use of diverse methodological approaches. Future studies should explore unintended consequences - whether beneficial or harmful -  in more depth and over longer time periods, in different population groups, and across different contexts. A more robust evidence base could inform and facilitate decisions about whether, how, and when to implement or terminate COVID-19 risk mitigation measures in school settings, and how to counter negative unintended consequences.","During the COVID-19 pandemic, different measures were implemented in schools to help stop the virus spreading. These measures included changes to school rules or actions with the following goals: To reduce the spread of the virus when people were together, To reduce the number of face-to-face contacts between people, To test whether people had COVID-19, To isolate those with COVID-19 to prevent it spreading. School measures like these can have both planned (intended) effects and unplanned (unintended) effects, which we need to monitor. For example, a rule to improve hand hygiene should lead to more handwashing (a planned effect) but could also lead to skin problems (an unplanned effect). These unplanned effects can be negative or positive, and can affect students, teachers, other school staff members, parents, and the wider community. We identified four types of school measures: Measures to make contacts safer, Measures to reduce the opportunity for contacts, Surveillance and response measures, Multi-component measures. We aimed to find and describe evidence on the unplanned effects of school measures implemented to help contain the spread of COVID-19. We searched for studies that looked at side effects of school measures. We grouped the side effects into the following categories: Physical and mental health and well-being, Health and social care services, Human rights, Acceptability of measures, Unfair differences in health outcomes, Civil life, social interactions, and education, Money and resources, The environment. We summarised the available information on school measures and their side effects. We included 60 studies from 25 countries. Regarding study design, 31 used numbers and statistics, 17 used text and descriptions, and 12 used both numbers and descriptions. Most studies looked at measures for staff (11 studies) or students (26 studies), or measures aimed at both staff and students or the whole school (20 studies). Only three studies looked at measures for parents or caregivers. The studies investigated the following measures in schools: Individual protection (26 studies); for example, wearing masks, Changes to the physical environment (20 studies); for example, improving ventilation, Rules about social interactions (25 studies); for example, mixing online and in-person teaching, Changes to services (1 study); for example, cancelling extracurricular activities, Rules about movement (3 studies); for example, staying in class at break time, Surveillance measures (9 studies); for example, testing students and teachers, Response measures (7 studies); for example, isolating people with COVID-19. Nine studies looked at the joint effects of more than one measure (for example, joint effects of wearing masks and improving ventilation). Most studies focused on the following unplanned effects: The influence of school measures on health and well-being (29 studies), Whether school measures were acceptable or easy to carry out (31 studies), How school measures affected social interactions, school organisation, and education (23 studies). Other unplanned effects included the following: Changes to unfair differences in health outcomes (2 studies), Effects on money and resources (7 studies), Effects on the environment (1 study). Most of the studies in the review looked at the influence of school measures on health and well-being; social interactions, school organisation, and education; and whether measures were acceptable and easy to carry out. The most common school measures were wearing masks, cleaning and disinfecting rooms and surfaces, mixing online and in-person learning, and ensuring physical distancing. Many studies also looked at combinations of several measures. This review identified the gaps, where more research is needed. We need more studies to look at a wider variety of unplanned effects. We also need more studies looking at the unplanned effects of other school measures, such as testing and response measures. Future studies should look at long-term effects, too. We need more information about how these measures work in different types of schools and in different countries. This would help people make decisions about when and how to use different school measures.",1105,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; public health and social measures; physical environment; surveillance and response measures; equality and equity; social welfare services; human and fundamental rights; acceptability and adherence; scoping review; risk mitigation measures,What factors should be considered to enhance the evidence base on unintended consequences of school measures in future studies?,How might combining different school measures affect the study outcomes regarding unintended consequences?,Select all of the following that are colors,What are the implications of the knowledge gaps identified in the study for pandemic management in schools?,What was the main goal of the measures implemented in schools during the COVID-19 pandemic?,Focusing solely on quantitative studies; Exploring unintended consequences across diverse contexts and populations; Limiting research to current measures without considering new interventions,Exploring unintended consequences across diverse contexts and populations,It could identify synergies and overlapping effects; It would ensure that every measure's consequence is isolated and clear; It might make it harder to attribute specific outcomes to individual measures,It could identify synergies and overlapping effects; It might make it harder to attribute specific outcomes to individual measures,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,They suggest a need for diverse methodological research approaches; They indicate that all necessary measures have been adequately assessed; They reveal that unintended consequences are well understood in all areas,They suggest a need for diverse methodological research approaches,To stop the spread of the virus in school settings; To improve academic performance; To increase physical activities,To stop the spread of the virus in school settings
63671bfc81a5eca4218b6417,finetuned_6,Exercise training for bronchiectasis,"Bronchiectasis is characterised by excessive sputum production, chronic cough, and acute exacerbations and is associated with symptoms of dyspnoea and fatigue, which reduce exercise tolerance and impair quality of life. Exercise training in isolation or in conjunction with other interventions is beneficial for people with other respiratory diseases, but its effects in bronchiectasis have not been well established.
To determine effects of exercise training compared to usual care on exercise tolerance (primary outcome), quality of life (primary outcome), incidence of acute exacerbation and hospitalisation, respiratory and mental health symptoms, physical function, mortality, and adverse events in people with stable or acute exacerbation of bronchiectasis.
We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Specialised Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization trials portal, from their inception to October 2020. We reviewed respiratory conference abstracts and reference lists of all primary studies and review articles for additional references.
We included randomised controlled trials in which exercise training of at least four weeks' duration (or eight sessions) was compared to usual care for people with stable bronchiectasis or experiencing an acute exacerbation. Co-interventions with exercise training including education, respiratory muscle training, and airway clearance therapy were permitted if also applied as part of usual care.
Two review authors independently screened and selected trials for inclusion, extracted outcome data, and assessed risk of bias. We contacted study authors for missing data. We calculated mean differences (MDs) using a random-effects model. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence.
We included six studies, two of which were published as abstracts, with a total of 275 participants. Five studies were undertaken with people with clinically stable bronchiectasis, and one pilot study was undertaken post acute exacerbation. All studies included co-interventions such as instructions for airway clearance therapy and/or breathing strategies, provision of an educational booklet, and delivery of educational sessions. The duration of training ranged from six to eight weeks, with a mix of supervised and unsupervised sessions conducted in the outpatient or home setting. No studies of children were included in the review; however we identified two studies as currently ongoing. No data were available regarding physical activity levels or adverse events. For people with stable bronchiectasis, evidence suggests that exercise training compared to usual care improves functional exercise tolerance as measured by the incremental shuttle walk distance, with a mean difference (MD) between groups of 87 metres (95% confidence interval (CI) 43 to 132 metres; 4 studies, 161 participants; low-certainty evidence). Evidence also suggests that exercise training improves six-minute walk distance (6MWD) (MD between groups of 42 metres, 95% CI 22 to 62; 1 study, 76 participants; low-certainty evidence). The magnitude of these observed mean changes appears clinically relevant as they exceed minimal clinically important difference (MCID) thresholds for people with chronic lung disease. Evidence suggests that quality of life improves following exercise training according to St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score (MD -9.62 points, 95% CI -15.67 to -3.56 points; 3 studies, 160 participants; low-certainty evidence), which exceeds the MCID of 4 points for this outcome. A reduction in dyspnoea (MD 1.0 points, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.53; 1 study, 76 participants) and fatigue (MD 1.51 points, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.22 points; 1 study, 76 participants) was observed following exercise training according to these domains of the Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire. However, there was no change in cough-related quality of life as measured by the Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ) (MD -0.09 points, 95% CI -0.98 to 0.80 points; 2 studies, 103 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), nor in anxiety or depression. Two studies reported longer-term outcomes up to 12 months after intervention completion; however exercise training did not appear to improve exercise capacity or quality of life more than usual care. Exercise training reduced the number of acute exacerbations of bronchiectasis over 12 months in people with stable bronchiectasis (odds ratio 0.26, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.81; 1 study, 55 participants). After an acute exacerbation of bronchiectasis, data from a single study (N = 27) suggest that exercise training compared to usual care confers little to no effect on exercise capacity (MD 11 metres, 95% CI -27 to 49 metres; low-certainty evidence), SGRQ total score (MD 6.34 points, 95%CI -17.08 to 29.76 points), or LCQ score (MD -0.08 points, 95% CI -0.94 to 0.78 points; low-certainty evidence) and does not reduce the time to first exacerbation (hazard ratio 0.83, 95% CI 0.31 to 2.22).
This review provides low-certainty evidence suggesting improvement in functional exercise capacity and quality of life immediately following exercise training in people with stable bronchiectasis; however the effects of exercise training on cough-related quality of life and psychological symptoms appear to be minimal. Due to inadequate reporting of methods, small study numbers, and variation between study findings, evidence is of very low to moderate certainty. Limited evidence is available to show longer-term effects of exercise training on these outcomes.","We wanted to know whether exercise training improves exercise tolerance, quality of life, or symptoms, and whether it reduces the number of future flare-ups (exacerbations) in people with bronchiectasis compared to those who did not participate in exercise training. We examined studies involving people with stable disease as well as those recovering from a recent flare-up, aiming to include evidence for both children and adults, although no studies involving children were found. Bronchiectasis causes chronic cough and sputum production, and people with this condition have an increased risk of exacerbations that worsen exercise tolerance and quality of life. While exercise training benefits people with other chronic lung conditions, its effects in bronchiectasis are less well understood. The evidence is current up to October 2020 and includes six studies with 275 participants, five of which involved people with stable disease. Exercise training was delivered alongside other treatments such as airway clearance therapy, respiratory muscle training, and education. Participants were randomly assigned to either exercise training or no exercise training. Training lasted at least six weeks and took place either in group settings or at home. None of the studies were funded by commercial companies. After completing exercise training, participants in a stable condition walked farther than those who did not train, with an average increase of 87 meters, although certainty of evidence is low. Participants also reported improved quality of life, less shortness of breath, and reduced fatigue. Moderate-certainty evidence showed that exercise training might not specifically improve cough-related symptoms, but the incidence of acute exacerbations was lower. Evidence was insufficient to determine whether the benefits lasted beyond the training period or whether exercise training increased overall physical activity. No benefits were observed for people who began exercise training soon after an acute flare-up. The certainty of evidence ranged from very low to moderate due to uncertainty in effect size, limitations in study design, and insufficient data. More studies with larger sample sizes are needed to understand the long-term effects of exercise training in people with bronchiectasis regardless of their clinical stability.",1074,Bronchiectasis; sputum production; dyspnoea; exercise tolerance; acute exacerbations; Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire; Leicester Cough Questionnaire; airway clearance therapy; co-interventions; minimal clinically important difference,What conclusions can be drawn about the impact of exercise training on the quality of life in bronchiectasis patients according to the summary?,"Based on the summary, what challenges remain unresolved for exercise training in bronchiectasis?",Select all of the following that are fruits,What was the primary objective of the study?,Describe the effect of exercise training on exercise tolerance in stable bronchiectasis patients.,Exercise training significantly improves the quality of life for stable bronchiectasis patients.; The improvement in quality of life is indefinite and requires further study.; Exercise training did not improve the quality of life at all.,Exercise training significantly improves the quality of life for stable bronchiectasis patients.; The improvement in quality of life is indefinite and requires further study.,Long-term benefits beyond the training period.; Initial high cost of exercise programs.; Effectiveness for people after acute flare-ups.,Long-term benefits beyond the training period.; Effectiveness for people after acute flare-ups.,dog; blue; grape,grape,To determine the effects of exercise training in people with bronchiectasis; To analyze the dietary habits of bronchiectasis patients; To evaluate the economic impact of bronchiectasis,To determine the effects of exercise training in people with bronchiectasis,Increases exercise tolerance; Decreases exercise tolerance; No effect on exercise tolerance,Increases exercise tolerance
63671bfc81a5eca4218b6417,finetuned_6,Does treating the coronary arteries of the heart help prevent heart attacks during major blood vessels surgeries?,"Postoperative myocardial infarction (POMI) is associated with major surgeries and remains the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in people undergoing vascular surgery, with an incidence rate ranging from 5% to 20%. Preoperative coronary interventions, such as coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI), may help prevent acute myocardial infarction in the perioperative period of major vascular surgery when used in addition to routine perioperative drugs (e.g. statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and antiplatelet agents), CABG by creating new blood circulation routes that bypass the blockages in the coronary vessels, and PCI by opening up blocked blood vessels. There is currently uncertainty around the benefits and harms of preoperative coronary interventions.
To assess the effects of preoperative coronary interventions for preventing acute myocardial infarction in the perioperative period of major open vascular or endovascular surgery.
We searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, LILACS, and CINAHL EBSCO on 13 March 2023. We also searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov.
We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs that compared the use of preoperative coronary interventions plus usual care versus usual care for preventing acute myocardial infarction during major open vascular or endovascular surgery. We included participants of any sex or any age undergoing major open vascular surgery, major endovascular surgery, or hybrid vascular surgery.
We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes of interest were acute myocardial infarction, all-cause mortality, and adverse events resulting from preoperative coronary interventions. Our secondary outcomes were cardiovascular mortality, quality of life, vessel or graft secondary patency, and length of hospital stay. We reported perioperative and long-term outcomes (more than 30 days after intervention). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.
We included three RCTs (1144 participants). Participants were randomised to receive either preoperative coronary revascularisation with PCI or CABG plus usual care or only usual care before major vascular surgery. One trial enrolled participants if they had no apparent evidence of coronary artery disease. Another trial selected participants classified as high risk for coronary disease through preoperative clinical and laboratorial testing. We excluded one trial from the meta-analysis because participants from both the control and the intervention groups were eligible to undergo preoperative coronary revascularisation. We identified a high risk of performance bias in all included trials, with one trial displaying a high risk of other bias. However, the risk of bias was either low or unclear in other domains. We observed no difference between groups for perioperative acute myocardial infarction, but the evidence is very uncertain (risk ratio (RR) 0.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 4.57; 2 trials, 888 participants; very low-certainty evidence). One trial showed a reduction in incidence of long-term (> 30 days) acute myocardial infarction in participants allocated to the preoperative coronary interventions plus usual care group, but the evidence was very uncertain (RR 0.09, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.28; 1 trial, 426 participants; very low-certainty evidence). There was little to no effect on all-cause mortality in the perioperative period when comparing the preoperative coronary intervention plus usual care group to usual care alone, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.31 to 2.04; 2 trials, 888 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of preoperative coronary interventions on long-term (follow up: 2.7 to 6.2 years) all-cause mortality (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.80; 2 trials, 888 participants; very low-certainty evidence). One study reported no adverse effects related to coronary angiography, whereas the other two studies reported five deaths due to revascularisations. There may be no effect on cardiovascular mortality when comparing preoperative coronary revascularisation plus usual care to usual care in the short term (RR 0.07, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.32; 1 trial, 426 participants; low-certainty evidence). Preoperative coronary interventions plus usual care in the short term may reduce length of hospital stay slightly when compared to usual care alone (mean difference -1.17 days, 95% CI -2.05 to -0.28; 1 trial, 462 participants; low-certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence due to concerns about risk of bias, imprecision, and inconsistency. None of the included trials reported on quality of life or vessel graft patency at either time point, and no study reported on adverse effects, cardiovascular mortality, or length of hospital stay at long-term follow-up.
Preoperative coronary interventions plus usual care may have little or no effect on preventing perioperative acute myocardial infarction and reducing perioperative all-cause mortality compared to usual care, but the evidence is very uncertain. Similarly, limited, very low-certainty evidence shows that preoperative coronary interventions may have little or no effect on reducing long-term all-cause mortality. There is very low-certainty evidence that preoperative coronary interventions plus usual care may prevent long-term myocardial infarction, and low-certainty evidence that they may reduce length of hospital stay slightly, but not cardiovascular mortality in the short term, when compared to usual care alone. Adverse effects of preoperative coronary interventions were poorly reported in trials. Quality of life and vessel or graft patency were not reported. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence most frequently for high risk of bias, inconsistency, or imprecision. None of the analysed trials provided significant data on subgroups of patients who could potentially experience more substantial benefits from preoperative coronary intervention (e.g. altered ventricular ejection fraction). There is a need for evidence from larger and homogeneous RCTs to provide adequate statistical power to assess the role of preoperative coronary interventions for preventing acute myocardial infarction in the perioperative period of major open vascular or endovascular surgery.","Heart attacks are an important complication after surgery (postoperative myocardial infarction). This complication plays a large role in major vascular surgeries. Postoperative myocardial infarction is the leading cause of morbidity (illness) and mortality (death) after major vascular surgeries. Coronary artery disease is a condition that affects the blood vessels of the heart (coronary arteries) and occurs when these vessels are narrowed by a plaque (atherosclerosis), usually made of cholesterol. This disease is the main cause of myocardial infarction (when the narrowing progresses to a blockage of the vessel). Atherosclerosis could explain the association between postoperative myocardial infarction and major vascular surgery, as it is the most common cause of both diseases.
We wanted to find out whether treating the coronary arteries prior to major vascular surgery (preoperative coronary interventions) can prevent postoperative myocardial infarction. Treatments to the coronary arteries consist of placing a catheter (thin tube) into an artery, usually in the leg or arm (percutaneous coronary intervention) and inserting it until it reaches the heart where a dye is injected to see if there is a narrowing of the coronary arteries (coronary angiography). Then, if a narrowing is identified, stents are used to open the blood vessels again bringing back the blood flow (coronary revascularisation). Another option for coronary revascularisation is coronary artery bypass graft (a surgical procedure used to bypass blockages in the coronary arteries). We wanted to know if identifying and treating people with severe coronary artery disease before vascular surgery decreases the number of heart attacks after vascular surgery.
We searched for trials that compared one group that received coronary treatments before major vascular surgery plus standard preoperative care (medical management or usual care) versus another group that received standard preoperative care (medical management or usual care) without coronary interventions. We wanted to know if there was a difference between groups in rates of heart attacks, mortality, or adverse outcomes. We compared these outcomes among trials and summarised our findings and then looked at whether the evidence was less or more reliable.
We found three trials involving 1144 participants. The trials compared either coronary angiography or coronary revascularisation, or both, before vascular surgery plus usual care to usual care alone (e.g. statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and antiplatelet agents). The studies used different criteria to select their participants, for example including only those at high risk for coronary artery disease, or also including individuals at low risk. We were not able to combine data from one trial in our summary because a large number of participants in the usual care group also underwent coronary treatments.
We found that treating the coronary arteries before vascular surgery may decrease the long-term rate of heart attacks, but we are very uncertain about the results. Further, they may reduce length of hospital stay slightly in the short term compared to usual care alone. We did not find any difference between groups in short- and long-term mortality and in short-term heart attack rate. None of the trials reported all the outcomes that we were interested in. Adverse events were poorly reported in trials: one study reported no deaths due to coronary angiography, whereas the other two studies reported five deaths due to coronary revascularisation.
We have little confidence in the results because participants and researchers were aware of which groups participants had been assigned to, which could have influenced the results. In addition, trials used different criteria to select their participants and used different methods, making it difficult to compare results. Finally, the overall results included the likelihood of having both benefit or harm from treatment to the coronary arteries before vascular surgery. None of the analysed trials provided information on subgroups of patients who could potentially experience greater benefits from the treatments under study, such as those with altered ventricular ejection fraction (ability of the heart to pump blood).",1038,Postoperative myocardial infarction; preoperative coronary interventions; coronary artery bypass grafting; percutaneous coronary interventions; coronary revascularisation; coronary artery disease; major vascular surgery; cardiovascular mortality; vessel graft patency; coronary angiography,How do the results address the effectiveness of preoperative coronary interventions in reducing long-term myocardial infarction?,What limitations did the study encounter in assessing the adverse events of preoperative coronary interventions?,Select all of the following that are colors,Identify the main reason for conducting the study on preoperative coronary interventions.,Summarize the study's findings on the effect of preoperative coronary interventions on short-term mortality rates.,"The results definitively show a reduction in long-term myocardial infarction; The results suggest a possible reduction, but with very low certainty; The results clearly indicate no effect on long-term myocardial infarction","The results suggest a possible reduction, but with very low certainty",Adverse events were frequently recorded in great detail; Adverse events were poorly reported in the trials; The study focused solely on adverse events,Adverse events were poorly reported in the trials,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,To determine if these interventions prevent postoperative myocardial infarctions; To develop new surgical techniques; To compare different medications for coronary artery disease,To determine if these interventions prevent postoperative myocardial infarctions,There is no difference between groups in short-term mortality rates; Short-term mortality rates significantly decrease; Short-term mortality rates significantly increase,There is no difference between groups in short-term mortality rates
5b9dd07de671c60001226b79,static_1,Nutritional therapy for reducing disability and improving activities of daily living in people after stroke,"Stroke patients often face disabilities that significantly interfere with their daily lives. Poor nutritional status is a common issue amongst these patients, and malnutrition can severely impact their functional recovery post-stroke. Therefore, nutritional therapy is crucial in managing stroke outcomes. However, its effects on disability, activities of daily living (ADL), and other critical outcomes have not been fully explored.
To evaluate the effects of nutritional therapy on reducing disability and improving ADL in patients after stroke.
We searched the trial registers of the Cochrane Stroke Group, CENTRAL, MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), CINAHL (from 1982), and AMED (from 1985) to 19 February 2024. We also searched trials and research registries (ClinicalTrials.gov, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform) and reference lists of articles.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared nutritional therapy with placebo, usual care, or one type of nutritional therapy in people after stroke. Nutritional therapy was defined as the administration of supplemental nutrients, including energy, protein, amino acids, fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals, through oral, enteral, or parenteral methods. As a comparator, one type of nutritional therapy refers to all forms of nutritional therapies, excluding the specific nutritional therapy defined for use in the intervention group.
We used Cochrane's Screen4Me workflow to assess the initial search results. Two review authors independently screened references that met the inclusion criteria, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias and the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We calculated the mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous data and the odds ratio (OR) for dichotomous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed heterogeneity using the I2statistic. The primary outcomes were disability and ADL. We also assessed gait, nutritional status, all-cause mortality, quality of life, hand and leg muscle strength, cognitive function, physical performance, stroke recurrence, swallowing function, neurological impairment, and the development of complications (adverse events) as secondary outcomes.
We identified 52 eligible RCTs involving 11,926 participants. Thirty-six studies were conducted in the acute phase, 10 in the subacute phase, three in the acute and subacute phases, and three in the chronic phase. Twenty-three studies included patients with ischaemic stroke, three included patients with haemorrhagic stroke, three included patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH), and 23 included patients with ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke including SAH. There were 25 types of nutritional supplements used as an intervention. The number of studies that assessed disability and ADL as outcomes were nine and 17, respectively. For the intervention using oral energy and protein supplements, which was a primary intervention in this review, six studies were included. The results for the seven outcomes focused on (disability, ADL, body weight change, all-cause mortality, gait speed, quality of life, and incidence of complications (adverse events)) were as follows: There was no evidence of a difference in reducing disability when 'good status' was defined as an mRS score of 0 to 2 (for 'good status': OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.10; 1 RCT, 4023 participants; low certainty evidence). Oral energy and protein supplements may improve ADL as indicated by an increase in the FIM motor score, but the evidence is very uncertain (MD 8.74, 95% CI 5.93 to 11.54; 2 RCTs, 165 participants; very low certainty evidence). Oral energy and protein supplements may increase body weight, but the evidence is very uncertain (MD 0.90, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.58; 3 RCTs, 205 participants; very low-certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in reducing all-cause mortality (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.14 to 2.28; 2 RCTs, 4065 participants; low-certainty evidence). For gait speed and quality of life, no study was identified. With regard to incidence of complications (adverse events), there was no evidence of a difference in the incidence of infections, including pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and septicaemia (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.20 to 2.30; 1 RCT, 42 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The intervention was associated with an increased incidence of diarrhoea compared to usual care (OR 4.29, 95% CI 1.98 to 9.28; 1 RCT, 4023 participants; low-certainty evidence) and the occurrence of hyperglycaemia or hypoglycaemia (OR 15.6, 95% CI 4.84 to 50.23; 1 RCT, 4023 participants; low-certainty evidence).
We are uncertain about the effect of nutritional therapy, including oral energy and protein supplements and other supplements identified in this review, on reducing disability and improving ADL in people after stroke. Various nutritional interventions were assessed for the outcomes in the included studies, and almost all studies had small sample sizes. This led to challenges in conducting meta-analyses and reduced the precision of the evidence. Moreover, most of the studies had issues with the risk of bias, especially in terms of the absence of blinding and unclear information. Regarding adverse events, the intervention with oral energy and protein supplements was associated with a higher number of adverse events, such as diarrhoea, hyperglycaemia, and hypoglycaemia, compared to usual care. However, the quality of the evidence was low. Given the low certainty of most of the evidence in our review, further research is needed. Future research should focus on targeted nutritional interventions to reduce disability and improve ADL based on a theoretical rationale in people after stroke and there is a need for improved methodology and reporting.","A stroke occurs when the blood supply to part of your brain is interrupted or reduced. There are three main types of strokes: an ischaemic stroke, which happens when a blood clot blocks or narrows an artery leading to the brain; a haemorrhagic stroke, which occurs when a blood vessel in the brain bursts, causing bleeding in the brain; and a subarachnoid haemorrhage, which occurs when there is bleeding in the space between the brain and the surrounding membrane (subarachnoid space). Nutrition therapy is an intervention using nutrients such as protein, vitamins, and energy for daily meals and/or between meals, and includes nutrition care based on the condition of each patient. People with and after a disease often receive nutritional therapy. Stroke patients easily get malnutrition because they do not receive enough energy and nutrients as a result of impairments. Stroke patients often experience physical and cognitive issues, and nutritional status may affect their improvement. We wanted to find out whether nutritional therapy reduces disability and improves daily activities in people after stroke.
We searched the medical literature for all randomised trials conducted on nutritional therapy in people after stroke. We also assessed whether nutritional therapy is safe in terms of unwanted effects. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We identified 52 studies that involved 11,926 participants. Thirty-six studies with acute stroke patients were conducted (within 14 days from stroke onset), 10 with subacute stroke patients (within 6 months, from 14 days after stroke onset), three with acute and subacute stroke patients, and three with chronic stroke patients (after 6 months from stroke onset). The stroke type investigated was ischaemic in 23 studies, haemorrhagic in three studies, subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) in three studies, and ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke including SAH in 23 studies. We identified 25 types of nutritional intervention in this review. The number of studies that assessed disability and ADL as outcomes were 9 and 17, respectively.
For the primary intervention of using oral energy and protein supplements, we identified six studies. We found that nutritional therapy using oral energy and protein supplements:
- may not reduce disability; however, the evidence is uncertain
- may improve daily activities; however, the evidence is very uncertain
For other outcomes, nutritional therapy using oral energy and protein supplements:
- may improve nutritional status in weight gain; however, the evidence is very uncertain
- may not decrease the risk of death from any cause; however, the evidence is uncertain
- were associated with an increased incidence of both diarrhoea and either hyperglycaemia (a condition where there is too much sugar (glucose) in the blood) or hypoglycaemia (a condition where there is too little sugar (glucose) in the blood); however, the evidence is uncertain
We did not find any studies with oral energy and protein supplements that reported walking speed and quality of life.
We are not confident of the evidence for reducing disability and improving daily activities for the following reasons:
- Patients in most studies were aware of the intervention they were receiving.
- Healthcare providers and outcome assessors were aware of the interventions the patients were receiving.
- Most studies that assessed ADL(activities of daily living) did not describe their methods in sufficient detail.
- The effect may differ according to stroke type, time from stroke onset, and nutritional status at the start of nutritional therapy, but we could not assess those differences sufficiently due to the small number of studies.",1064,Nutritional therapy; ischaemic stroke; enteral methods; parenteral methods; neurological impairment; functional recovery post-stroke; all-cause mortality; incidence of complications; nutritional status; oral energy and protein supplements,What are the main types of stroke mentioned in the summary?,Summarize the primary goal of the study about nutritional therapy for stroke patients.,Select all of the following that are colors,Identify adverse events associated with oral energy and protein supplements mentioned in the study.,Describe the types of nutritional therapy interventions included in the review.,Ischaemic stroke; Cardiac stroke; Haemorrhagic stroke,Ischaemic stroke; Haemorrhagic stroke,To reduce disability and improve daily activities; To develop new medications for stroke; To create a new diet plan for all patients,To reduce disability and improve daily activities,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Diarrhoea; Increased walking speed; Either hyperglycaemia or hypoglycaemia,Diarrhoea; Either hyperglycaemia or hypoglycaemia,Nutrients for daily and between meal care; Psychological counseling; Surgical interventions,Nutrients for daily and between meal care
5b9dd07de671c60001226b79,static_2,Exercise training for bronchiectasis,"Bronchiectasis is characterised by excessive sputum production, chronic cough, and acute exacerbations and is associated with symptoms of dyspnoea and fatigue, which reduce exercise tolerance and impair quality of life. Exercise training in isolation or in conjunction with other interventions is beneficial for people with other respiratory diseases, but its effects in bronchiectasis have not been well established.
To determine effects of exercise training compared to usual care on exercise tolerance (primary outcome), quality of life (primary outcome), incidence of acute exacerbation and hospitalisation, respiratory and mental health symptoms, physical function, mortality, and adverse events in people with stable or acute exacerbation of bronchiectasis.
We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Specialised Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization trials portal, from their inception to October 2020. We reviewed respiratory conference abstracts and reference lists of all primary studies and review articles for additional references.
We included randomised controlled trials in which exercise training of at least four weeks' duration (or eight sessions) was compared to usual care for people with stable bronchiectasis or experiencing an acute exacerbation. Co-interventions with exercise training including education, respiratory muscle training, and airway clearance therapy were permitted if also applied as part of usual care.
Two review authors independently screened and selected trials for inclusion, extracted outcome data, and assessed risk of bias. We contacted study authors for missing data. We calculated mean differences (MDs) using a random-effects model. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence.
We included six studies, two of which were published as abstracts, with a total of 275 participants. Five studies were undertaken with people with clinically stable bronchiectasis, and one pilot study was undertaken post acute exacerbation. All studies included co-interventions such as instructions for airway clearance therapy and/or breathing strategies, provision of an educational booklet, and delivery of educational sessions. The duration of training ranged from six to eight weeks, with a mix of supervised and unsupervised sessions conducted in the outpatient or home setting. No studies of children were included in the review; however we identified two studies as currently ongoing. No data were available regarding physical activity levels or adverse events. For people with stable bronchiectasis, evidence suggests that exercise training compared to usual care improves functional exercise tolerance as measured by the incremental shuttle walk distance, with a mean difference (MD) between groups of 87 metres (95% confidence interval (CI) 43 to 132 metres; 4 studies, 161 participants; low-certainty evidence). Evidence also suggests that exercise training improves six-minute walk distance (6MWD) (MD between groups of 42 metres, 95% CI 22 to 62; 1 study, 76 participants; low-certainty evidence). The magnitude of these observed mean changes appears clinically relevant as they exceed minimal clinically important difference (MCID) thresholds for people with chronic lung disease. Evidence suggests that quality of life improves following exercise training according to St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score (MD -9.62 points, 95% CI -15.67 to -3.56 points; 3 studies, 160 participants; low-certainty evidence), which exceeds the MCID of 4 points for this outcome. A reduction in dyspnoea (MD 1.0 points, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.53; 1 study, 76 participants) and fatigue (MD 1.51 points, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.22 points; 1 study, 76 participants) was observed following exercise training according to these domains of the Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire. However, there was no change in cough-related quality of life as measured by the Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ) (MD -0.09 points, 95% CI -0.98 to 0.80 points; 2 studies, 103 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), nor in anxiety or depression. Two studies reported longer-term outcomes up to 12 months after intervention completion; however exercise training did not appear to improve exercise capacity or quality of life more than usual care. Exercise training reduced the number of acute exacerbations of bronchiectasis over 12 months in people with stable bronchiectasis (odds ratio 0.26, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.81; 1 study, 55 participants). After an acute exacerbation of bronchiectasis, data from a single study (N = 27) suggest that exercise training compared to usual care confers little to no effect on exercise capacity (MD 11 metres, 95% CI -27 to 49 metres; low-certainty evidence), SGRQ total score (MD 6.34 points, 95%CI -17.08 to 29.76 points), or LCQ score (MD -0.08 points, 95% CI -0.94 to 0.78 points; low-certainty evidence) and does not reduce the time to first exacerbation (hazard ratio 0.83, 95% CI 0.31 to 2.22).
This review provides low-certainty evidence suggesting improvement in functional exercise capacity and quality of life immediately following exercise training in people with stable bronchiectasis; however the effects of exercise training on cough-related quality of life and psychological symptoms appear to be minimal. Due to inadequate reporting of methods, small study numbers, and variation between study findings, evidence is of very low to moderate certainty. Limited evidence is available to show longer-term effects of exercise training on these outcomes.","We wanted to know whether exercise training improves exercise tolerance, quality of life, or symptoms, and whether it reduces the number of future flare-ups (exacerbations) in people with bronchiectasis compared to those who did not participate in exercise training. We examined studies involving people with stable disease as well as those recovering from a recent flare-up, aiming to include evidence for both children and adults, although no studies involving children were found. Bronchiectasis causes chronic cough and sputum production, and people with this condition have an increased risk of exacerbations that worsen exercise tolerance and quality of life. While exercise training benefits people with other chronic lung conditions, its effects in bronchiectasis are less well understood. The evidence is current up to October 2020 and includes six studies with 275 participants, five of which involved people with stable disease. Exercise training was delivered alongside other treatments such as airway clearance therapy, respiratory muscle training, and education. Participants were randomly assigned to either exercise training or no exercise training. Training lasted at least six weeks and took place either in group settings or at home. None of the studies were funded by commercial companies. After completing exercise training, participants in a stable condition walked farther than those who did not train, with an average increase of 87 meters, although certainty of evidence is low. Participants also reported improved quality of life, less shortness of breath, and reduced fatigue. Moderate-certainty evidence showed that exercise training might not specifically improve cough-related symptoms, but the incidence of acute exacerbations was lower. Evidence was insufficient to determine whether the benefits lasted beyond the training period or whether exercise training increased overall physical activity. No benefits were observed for people who began exercise training soon after an acute flare-up. The certainty of evidence ranged from very low to moderate due to uncertainty in effect size, limitations in study design, and insufficient data. More studies with larger sample sizes are needed to understand the long-term effects of exercise training in people with bronchiectasis regardless of their clinical stability.",1074,Bronchiectasis; sputum production; dyspnoea; exercise tolerance; acute exacerbations; Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire; Leicester Cough Questionnaire; airway clearance therapy; co-interventions; minimal clinically important difference,What conclusions can be drawn about the impact of exercise training on the quality of life in bronchiectasis patients according to the summary?,"Based on the summary, what challenges remain unresolved for exercise training in bronchiectasis?",Select all of the following that are fruits,What was the primary objective of the study?,Describe the effect of exercise training on exercise tolerance in stable bronchiectasis patients.,Exercise training significantly improves the quality of life for stable bronchiectasis patients.; The improvement in quality of life is indefinite and requires further study.; Exercise training did not improve the quality of life at all.,Exercise training significantly improves the quality of life for stable bronchiectasis patients.; The improvement in quality of life is indefinite and requires further study.,Long-term benefits beyond the training period.; Initial high cost of exercise programs.; Effectiveness for people after acute flare-ups.,Long-term benefits beyond the training period.; Effectiveness for people after acute flare-ups.,dog; blue; grape,grape,To determine the effects of exercise training in people with bronchiectasis; To analyze the dietary habits of bronchiectasis patients; To evaluate the economic impact of bronchiectasis,To determine the effects of exercise training in people with bronchiectasis,Increases exercise tolerance; Decreases exercise tolerance; No effect on exercise tolerance,Increases exercise tolerance
5b9dd07de671c60001226b79,static_2,Clopidogrel plus aspirin versus aspirin alone for preventing cardiovascular events,"Aspirin is the prophylactic antiplatelet drug of choice for people with cardiovascular disease. Adding a second antiplatelet drug to aspirin may produce additional benefit for people at high risk and people with established cardiovascular disease. This is an update to a previously published review from 2011.
To review the benefit and harm of adding clopidogrel to aspirin therapy for preventing cardiovascular events in people who have coronary disease, ischaemic cerebrovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, or were at high risk of atherothrombotic disease, but did not have a coronary stent. We updated the searches of CENTRAL (2017, Issue 6), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 4 July 2017) and Embase (Ovid, 1947 to 3 July 2017) on 4 July 2017. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP portal, and handsearched reference lists. We applied no language restrictions. We included all randomised controlled trials comparing over 30 days use of aspirin plus clopidogrel with aspirin plus placebo or aspirin alone in people with coronary disease, ischaemic cerebrovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, or at high risk of atherothrombotic disease. We excluded studies including only people with coronary drug-eluting stent (DES) or non-DES, or both. We collected data on mortality from cardiovascular causes, all-cause mortality, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction, fatal and non-fatal ischaemic stroke, major and minor bleeding. The overall treatment effect was estimated by the pooled risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI), using a fixed-effect model (Mantel-Haenszel); we used a random-effects model in cases of moderate or severe heterogeneity (I2=30%). We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We used GRADE profiler (GRADE Pro) to import data from Review Manager to create a 'Summary of findings' table. The search identified 13 studies in addition to the two studies in the previous version of our systematic review. Overall, we included data from 15 trials with 33,970 people. We completed a 'Risk of bias' assessment for all studies. The risk of bias was low in four trials because they were at low risk of bias for all key domains (random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, selective outcome reporting and incomplete outcome data), even if some of them were funded by the pharmaceutical industry. Analysis showed no difference in the effectiveness of aspirin plus clopidogrel in preventing cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.10; participants = 31,903; studies = 7; moderate quality evidence), and no evidence of a difference in all-cause mortality (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.25; participants = 32,908; studies = 9; low quality evidence). There was a lower risk of fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction with clopidogrel plus aspirin compared with aspirin plus placebo or aspirin alone (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.90; participants = 16,175; studies = 6; moderate quality evidence). There was a reduction in the risk of fatal and non-fatal ischaemic stroke (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.91; participants = 4006; studies = 5; moderate quality evidence). However, there was a higher risk of major bleeding with clopidogrel plus aspirin compared with aspirin plus placebo or aspirin alone (RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.64; participants = 33,300; studies = 10; moderate quality evidence) and of minor bleeding (RR 2.03, 95% CI 1.75 to 2.36; participants = 14,731; studies = 8; moderate quality evidence). Overall, we would expect 13 myocardial infarctions and 23 ischaemic strokes be prevented for every 1000 patients treated with the combination in a median follow-up period of 12 months, but 9 major bleeds and 33 minor bleeds would be caused during a median follow-up period of 10.5 and 6 months, respectively. The available evidence demonstrates that the use of clopidogrel plus aspirin in people at high risk of cardiovascular disease and people with established cardiovascular disease without a coronary stent is associated with a reduction in the risk of myocardial infarction and ischaemic stroke, and an increased risk of major and minor bleeding compared with aspirin alone. According to GRADE criteria, the quality of evidence was moderate for all outcomes except all-cause mortality (low quality evidence) and adverse events (very low quality evidence).","We reviewed the evidence about the effect of clopidogrel and aspirin in people at high risk of getting heart disease or having a stroke, and in those who already have heart disease. Aspirin is widely used to prevent heart disease, but the effects for people at high risk of getting heart disease are small. We wanted to find out whether taking clopidogrel (which is also used to prevent heart disease) and aspirin is better to prevent getting heart disease or having a stroke than taking aspirin alone. We also wanted to find out if people who already had heart disease were at less risk of dying, having a heart attack or stroke if they took clopidogrel and aspirin. This review contains evidence up to July 2017. We found 15 studies which together included more than 30,000 people at high risk of heart disease who are taking aspirin. All studies randomly assigned participants to the intervention group (taking aspirin and clopidogrel) or the control group (taking aspirin and placebo (a pretend treatment that has no effect). Participants took clopidogrel between six weeks and 3.4 years, depending on the study they took part in. The results do not apply to people with recent placement of coronary stents (tubes inserted in the blood vessel to keep it open), who were excluded from this review. The results showed that there is a benefit of adding clopidogrel to aspirin in terms of reducing the risk of heart attack or stroke. However, there is a higher risk of major and minor bleeding associated with this. There was no effect on death due to heart problems or death from any cause. Using Cochrane criteria, four trials were at low risk of bias. Using GRADE standards, the quality of published evidence was moderate for most results, but low for death from any cause and very low for side effects.",1068,antiplatelet drug; cardiovascular disease; coronary disease; ischaemic cerebrovascular disease; peripheral arterial disease; atherothrombotic disease; coronary stent; myocardial infarction; ischaemic stroke; major bleeding,What was the primary motivation for the study?,What outcome was observed with adding clopidogrel to aspirin?,Select all of the following that are colors,Which adverse effect was noted when combining clopidogrel with aspirin?,,To assess whether adding clopidogrel to aspirin reduces heart disease risk.; To examine the impact of aspirin on coronary stents.; To determine the best time to take aspirin daily.,To assess whether adding clopidogrel to aspirin reduces heart disease risk.,Reduced risk of heart attack or stroke.; Increased risk of coronary stent complications.; Enhanced performance in physical activities.,Reduced risk of heart attack or stroke.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Higher risk of major and minor bleeding.; Increased likelihood of headaches.; Lower risk of developing high blood pressure.,Higher risk of major and minor bleeding.,,
5b9dd07de671c60001226b79,interactive_3,Renin angiotensin system inhibitors versus other types of medicine for hypertension,"This is the first update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2015. Renin angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors include angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and renin inhibitors. They are widely prescribed for treatment of hypertension, especially for people with diabetes because of postulated advantages for reducing diabetic nephropathy and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Despite widespread use for hypertension, the efficacy and safety of RAS inhibitors compared to other antihypertensive drug classes remains unclear. To evaluate the benefits and harms of first-line RAS inhibitors compared to other first-line antihypertensive drugs in people with hypertension. The Cochrane Hypertension Group Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to November 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. The searches had no language restrictions. We included randomized, active-controlled, double-blinded studies (RCTs) with at least six months follow-up in people with elevated blood pressure (? 130/85 mmHg), which compared first-line RAS inhibitors with other first-line antihypertensive drug classes and reported morbidity and mortality or blood pressure outcomes. We excluded people with proven secondary hypertension. Two authors independently selected the included trials, evaluated the risks of bias and entered the data for analysis. This update includes three new RCTs, totaling 45 in all, involving 66,625 participants, with a mean age of 66 years. Much of the evidence for our key outcomes is dominated by a small number of large RCTs at low risk for most sources of bias. Imbalances in the added second-line antihypertensive drugs in some of the studies were important enough for us to downgrade the quality of the evidence. Primary outcomes were all-cause death, fatal and non-fatal stroke, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), fatal and non-fatal congestive heart failure (CHF) requiring hospitalizations, total cardiovascular (CV) events (fatal and non-fatal stroke, fatal and non-fatal MI and fatal and non-fatal CHF requiring hospitalization), and end-stage renal failure (ESRF). Secondary outcomes were systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR). Compared with first-line calcium channel blockers (CCBs), we found moderate-certainty evidence that first-line RAS inhibitors decreased heart failure (HF) (35,143 participants in 5 RCTs, risk ratio (RR) 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77 to 0.90, absolute risk reduction (ARR) 1.2%), and that they increased stroke (34,673 participants in 4 RCTs, RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.32, absolute risk increase (ARI) 0.7%). Moderate-certainty evidence showed that first-line RAS inhibitors and first-line CCBs did not differ for all-cause death (35,226 participants in 5 RCTs, RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.09); total CV events (35,223 participants in 6 RCTs, RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.02); and total MI (35,043 participants in 5 RCTs, RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.09). Low-certainty evidence suggests they did not differ for ESRF (19,551 participants in 4 RCTs, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.05). Compared with first-line thiazides, we found moderate-certainty evidence that first-line RAS inhibitors increased HF (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.31, ARI 1.0%), and increased stroke (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.28, ARI 0.6%). Moderate-certainty evidence showed that first-line RAS inhibitors and first-line thiazides did not differ for all-cause death (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.07); total CV events (24,379 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 1.05, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.11); and total MI (24,379 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.01). Low-certainty evidence suggests they did not differ for ESRF (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.37). Compared with first-line beta-blockers, low-certainty evidence suggests that first-line RAS inhibitors decreased total CV events (9239 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.98, ARR 1.7%), and decreased stroke (9193 participants in 1 RCT, RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.88, ARR 1.7%). Low-certainty evidence suggests that first-line RAS inhibitors and first-line beta-blockers did not differ for all-cause death (9193 participants in 1 RCT, RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.01); HF (9193 participants in 1 RCT, RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.18); and total MI (9239 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.27). Blood pressure comparisons between first-line RAS inhibitors and other first-line classes showed either no differences or small differences that did not necessarily correlate with the differences in the morbidity outcomes. There is no information about non-fatal serious adverse events, as none of the trials reported this outcome. All-cause death is similar for first-line RAS inhibitors and first-line CCBs, thiazides and beta-blockers. There are, however, differences for some morbidity outcomes. First-line thiazides caused less HF and stroke than first-line RAS inhibitors. First-line CCBs increased HF but decreased stroke compared to first-line RAS inhibitors. The magnitude of the increase in HF exceeded the decrease in stroke. Low-quality evidence suggests that first-line RAS inhibitors reduced stroke and total CV events compared to first-line beta-blockers. The small differences in effect on blood pressure between the different classes of drugs did not correlate with the differences in the morbidity outcomes.","We determined how RAS (renin angiotensin system) inhibitors compared as first-line medicines for treating hypertension with other types of first-line medicines (thiazide diuretics, beta-blockers, CCBs, alpha-blockers, or central nervous system (CNS) active drugs) for hypertension. Hypertension is a long-lasting medical condition and associated with cardiovascular mortality and morbidity such as coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral vascular disease, which will reduce quality of life. RAS inhibitors have become a focus of interventions for hypertension in recent years and have been widely prescribed for treatment of hypertension. However, it remains unclear whether RAS inhibitors are superior to other antihypertensive drugs in terms of clinically relevant outcomes.
We searched for evidence up to November 2017. We included randomized, double-blind, parallel design RCTs for the present review. 45 trials with 66,625 participants who were followed-up for between 0.5 year and 5.6 years were included. The participants had an average age of 66 years. Overall, certainty of evidence was assessed as low to moderate according to the GRADE assessment. Moderate-certainty evidence demonstrated superiority of first-line thiazides to first-line RAS inhibitors in preventing heart failure and stroke. The certainty of evidence was assessed moderate for comparison between RAS inhibitors and CCBs. The certainty of evidence was low for comparison between RAS inhibitors and beta-blockers on total cardiovascular events and stroke since the results were based primarily on one large trial with moderate to high risk of bias.",1066,Renin angiotensin system inhibitors; diabetic nephropathy; cardiovascular morbidity; mortality; calcium channel blockers; heart failure; myocardial infarction; end-stage renal failure; thiazides; beta-blockers,What was the main focus of the Cochrane Review on RAS inhibitors?,Why are RAS inhibitors widely prescribed for people with hypertension?,Select all of the following that are fruits,"According to the review, how do thiazides compare to RAS inhibitors?",How is the overall quality of evidence described in the review?,To evaluate RAS inhibitors compared to other first-line antihypertensive drugs.; To study the cost-effectiveness of RAS inhibitors.; To compare the side effects of different antihypertensive drugs.,To evaluate RAS inhibitors compared to other first-line antihypertensive drugs.,They are believed to reduce diabetic nephropathy and cardiovascular issues.; They are the cheapest option available.; They have the fewest side effects.,They are believed to reduce diabetic nephropathy and cardiovascular issues.,dog; blue; grape,grape,Thiazides are superior in preventing heart failure and stroke.; Thiazides result in more side effects.; Thiazides are less effective in reducing blood pressure.,Thiazides are superior in preventing heart failure and stroke.,The overall quality of evidence is low to moderate.; The overall quality of evidence is high.; The overall quality of evidence is very low.,The overall quality of evidence is low to moderate.
5b9dd07de671c60001226b79,interactive_4,Do non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive medicines for steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome in children help prevent relapse?,"About 80% of children with steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SSNS) have relapses. Of these children, half will relapse frequently, and are at risk of adverse effects from corticosteroids. While non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive medications prolong periods of remission, they have significant potential adverse effects. Currently, there is no consensus about the most appropriate second-line agent in children with frequently relapsing SSNS. In addition, these medications could be used with corticosteroids in the initial episode of SSNS to prolong the period of remission. This is the fifth update of a review first published in 2001 and updated in 2005, 2008, 2013 and 2020. To evaluate the benefits and harms of non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive medications in SSNS in children with a relapsing course of SSNS and in children with their first episode of nephrotic syndrome.
We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to October 2024 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs were included if they involved children with SSNS and compared non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive medications with placebo, corticosteroids or no treatment; different non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive medications, or different doses, durations or routes of administration of the same non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive medication. Two authors independently assessed study eligibility, risk of bias and extracted data from the included studies. Statistical analyses were performed using a random-effects model and results expressed as risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes or mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. We identified 58 studies (122 reports) randomising 3720 children. Half were multicentre studies, and most studies were undertaken in South and East Asia (28 studies) and Europe (20 studies). The numbers of children randomised ranged from 14 to 211. Risk of bias assessment indicated that 32 and 33 studies were at low risk of bias for sequence generation and allocation concealment, respectively. Eleven studies were at low risk of performance bias and 13 were at low risk of detection bias. Forty-eight and 36 studies were at low risk of incomplete and selective reporting, respectively. Rituximab with or without prednisone compared with placebo with or without prednisone probably reduces the number of children experiencing relapse at six months (5 studies, 182 children: RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.43) and 12 months (3 studies, 108 children: RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.09) (moderate certainty), may increase the number with severe infusion reactions (4 studies, 162 children: RR 5.21, 95% CI 1.19 to 22.89; low certainty), but not severe infection or arthropathy (low certainty). Rituximab compared with tacrolimus probably reduces the risk of relapse at 12 months (4 studies, 238 children: RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.96)and may reduce the risk of relapse whencompared with low dose mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (1 study, 30 children: RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.62). Rituximab followed by MMF for 500 days reduces the risk of relapse compared with rituximab followed by placebo for 500 days (1 study, 78 children: RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.63; high certainty). Rituximab probably does not differ from ofatumumab in the riisk of relapse and 12 months (1 study, 140 children: RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.41; moderate certainty) or in adverse events. MMF and levamisole (1 study, 149 children: RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.16) may have similar effects on the number of children who relapse at 12 months (low certainty). Cyclosporin compared with MMF may reduce the risk of relapse at 12 months (3 studies, 114 children: RR 1.57, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.30) (low certainty). Levamisole compared with steroids or placebo may reduce the number of children with relapse during treatment (8 studies, 474 children: RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.82) (low certainty). Preliminary data from single studies indicate that levamisole and prednisone compared with prednisone alone may delay the onset of relapse after the initial episode of SSNS and that levamisole compared with increasing prednisone administration from alternate day to daily at the onset of infection may reduce the risk of relapse with infection (low certainty). Cyclosporin compared with prednisone may reduce the number of children who relapse (1 study, 104 children: RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.83) (low certainty). Alkylating agents compared with cyclosporin may make little or no difference to the risk of relapse during cyclosporin treatment (2 studies, 95 children: RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.48) (low certainty evidence) but may reduce the risk of relapse at 12 to 24 months (2 studies, 95 children: RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.74) (low certainty). Alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil) compared with prednisone probably reduce the number of children who experience relapse at six to 12 months (6 studies, 202 children: RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.60) and at 12 to 24 months (4 studies, 59 children: RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.46) (moderate certainty). New studies incorporated in this review update indicate that rituximab compared with prednisone, tacrolimus, or MMF is a valuable additional agent for managing children with relapsing SSNS. Comparative studies of CNIs, MMF, and levamisole suggest that CNIs may be more effective than MMF and that levamisole may be similar in efficacy to MMF. Important new studies suggest that MMF prolongs remission following rituximab, that levamisole may prevent infection-related relapse more effectively than changing from alternate-day to daily prednisone and that levamisole and prednisone compared with prednisone alone may prolong the time to first relapse. There are currently 23 ongoing studies which should improve our understanding of how to treat children with frequently relapsing SSNS.","Children with nephrotic syndrome lose large amounts of protein from their bloodstream into their urine, causing swelling, especially in the face, stomach and legs. The risk of infection also increases because important proteins used by children's immune systems are lost in the urine. Corticosteroid medication, such as prednisone, can stop protein loss, but this often happens again (relapse). Giving children further corticosteroids can lead to poor growth, cataracts, osteoporosis (a condition in which bones become weak and brittle) and high blood pressure. A wide range of medicines have been tried to treat relapses in children and to prevent further relapses in children who relapse frequently. Immunosuppressive medicines (medicines that dampen down the body's immune system) have different mechanisms of action and have been demonstrated to provide longer remission (a period of time when signs and symptoms of nephrotic syndrome disappear) compared with steroids alone. Using these may enable steroids to be withdrawn or the dose reduced. We wanted to find out the best treatment options for children who have frequent relapses of nephrotic syndrome to stop the leaking of protein from the blood into the urine and to avoid the harmful side effects of steroids. We also wanted to find out if these other treatment options were associated with any unwanted effects. We searched for all studies that compared the benefits and harms of randomly allocating non-steroid immunosuppressive medicines to children who have frequent repeated episodes of nephrotic syndrome. We compared and summarised the studies' results and rated our confidence in the information based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 58 studies randomising 3720 children looking at a wide variety of non-steroid treatment options. Half of the studies were conducted in multiple centres around the world, and most were done in South and East Asia (28 studies) and Europe (20 studies). The number of children randomised ranged from 14 to 211. Rituximab compared to a placebo (dummy medicine) probably reduces the risk of a relapse at six and 12 months, but may increase the number who have severe reactions to the infusion. Rituximab probably reduces the risk of relapse at 12 months when compared to tacrolimus, and may reduce the risk when compared to mycophenolate mofetil. We also found that mycophenolate mofetil prolongs the length of remission induced by rituximab. Tacrolimus, cyclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil, and levamisole may reduce the risk of relapse in children with frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome. Cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil compared with steroids probably reduce the number of children who experience a relapse. We are confident that mycophenolate mofetil prolongs the length of remission induced by rituximab. We are moderately confident that rituximab compared to placebo or tacrolimus reduces the risk of relapse in children who experience frequent relapses of nephrotic syndrome. We are also moderately confident that cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil compared with steroids probably reduce the number of children who experience a relapse. We are less confident about the effects of other non-steroid immunosuppressive medicines on reducing the risk of relapse. We are not confident in the evidence for adverse events, as they were rarely or poorly reported for all of our comparisons.",1088,Steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome; relapses; corticosteroids; immunosuppressive medications; rituximab; prednisone; tacrolimus; mycophenolate mofetil; cyclosporin; alkylating agents,What condition in children is associated with protein loss in the urine?,What are some possible side effects of corticosteroid use in children?,Select all of the following that are colors,How does rituximab compare to a placebo in preventing relapse?,Which medication is believed to prolong remission induced by rituximab?,Nephrotic syndrome; Osteoporosis; Cataracts,Nephrotic syndrome,High blood pressure; Improved growth; Cataracts,High blood pressure; Cataracts,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Probably reduces the risk of relapse; Has no effect on relapse risk; Increases risk of relapse,Probably reduces the risk of relapse,Mycophenolate mofetil; Levamisole; Cyclosporin,Mycophenolate mofetil
5b9dd07de671c60001226b79,interactive_4,Telerehabilitation services for stroke,"Telerehabilitation offers an alternate way of delivering rehabilitation services. Information and communication technologies are used to facilitate communication between the healthcare professional and the patient in a remote location. The use of telerehabilitation is becoming more viable as the speed and sophistication of communication technologies improve. However, it is currently unclear how effective this model of delivery is relative to rehabilitation delivered face-to-face or when added to usual care.
To determine whether the use of telerehabilitation leads to improved ability to perform activities of daily living amongst stroke survivors when compared with (1) in-person rehabilitation (when the clinician and the patient are at the same physical location and rehabilitation is provided face-to-face); or (2) no rehabilitation or usual care. Secondary objectives were to determine whether use of telerehabilitation leads to greater independence in self-care and domestic life and improved mobility, balance, health-related quality of life, depression, upper limb function, cognitive function or functional communication when compared with in-person rehabilitation and no rehabilitation. Additionally, we aimed to report on the presence of adverse events, cost-effectiveness, feasibility and levels of user satisfaction associated with telerehabilitation interventions.
We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (June 2019), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (the Cochrane Library, Issue 6, 2019), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to June 2019), Embase (1974 to June 2019), and eight additional databases. We searched trial registries and reference lists.
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of telerehabilitation in stroke. We included studies that compared telerehabilitation with in-person rehabilitation or no rehabilitation. In addition, we synthesised and described the results of RCTs that compared two different methods of delivering telerehabilitation services without an alternative group. We included rehabilitation programmes that used a combination of telerehabilitation and in-person rehabilitation provided that the greater proportion of intervention was provided via telerehabilitation.
Two review authors independently identified trials on the basis of prespecified inclusion criteria, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. A third review author moderated any disagreements. The review authors contacted investigators to ask for missing information. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence and interpret findings.
We included 22 trials in the review involving a total of 1937 participants. The studies ranged in size from the inclusion of 10 participants to 536 participants, and reporting quality was often inadequate, particularly in relation to random sequence generation and allocation concealment. Selective outcome reporting and incomplete outcome data were apparent in several studies. Study interventions and comparisons varied, meaning that, in many cases, it was inappropriate to pool studies. Intervention approaches included post-hospital discharge support programs, upper limb training, lower limb and mobility retraining and communication therapy for people with post-stroke language disorders. Studies were either conducted upon discharge from hospital or with people in the subacute or chronic phases following stroke. Primary outcome: we found moderate-quality evidence that there was no difference in activities of daily living between people who received a post-hospital discharge telerehabilitation intervention and those who received usual care (based on 2 studies with 661 participants (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.15 to 0.15)). We found low-quality evidence of no difference in effects on activities of daily living between telerehabilitation and in-person physical therapy programmes (based on 2 studies with 75 participants: SMD 0.03, 95% CI -0.43 to 0.48). Secondary outcomes: we found a low quality of evidence that there was no difference between telerehabilitation and in-person rehabilitation for balance outcomes (based on 3 studies with 106 participants: SMD 0.08, 95%CI -0.30 to 0.46). Pooling of three studies with 569 participants showed moderate-quality evidence that there was no difference between those who received post-discharge support interventions and those who received usual care on health-related quality of life (SMD 0.03, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.20). Similarly, pooling of six studies (with 1145 participants) found moderate-quality evidence that there was no difference in depressive symptoms when comparing post-discharge tele-support programs with usual care (SMD -0.04, 95% CI -0.19 to 0.11). We found no difference between groups for upper limb function (based on 3 studies with 170 participants: mean difference (MD) 1.23, 95% CI -2.17 to 4.64, low-quality evidence) when a computer program was used to remotely retrain upper limb function in comparison to in-person therapy. Evidence was insufficient to draw conclusions on the effects of telerehabilitation on mobility or participant satisfaction with the intervention. No studies evaluated the cost-effectiveness of telerehabilitation; however, five of the studies reported health service utilisation outcomes or costs of the interventions provided within the study. Two studies reported on adverse events, although no serious trial-related adverse events were reported.
While there is now an increasing number of RCTs testing the efficacy of telerehabilitation, it is hard to draw conclusions about the effects as interventions and comparators varied greatly across studies. In addition, there were few adequately powered studies and several studies included in this review were at risk of bias. At this point, there is only low or moderate-level evidence testing whether telerehabilitation is a more effective or similarly effective way to provide rehabilitation. Short-term post-hospital discharge telerehabilitation programmes have not been shown to reduce depressive symptoms, improve quality of life, or improve independence in activities of daily living when compared with usual care. Studies comparing telerehabilitation and in-person therapy have also not found significantly different outcomes between groups, suggesting that telerehabilitation is not inferior. Some studies reported that telerehabilitation was less expensive to provide but information was lacking about cost-effectiveness. Only two trials reported on whether or not any adverse events had occurred; these trials found no serious adverse events were related to telerehabilitation. The field is still emerging and more studies are needed to draw more definitive conclusions. In addition, while this review examined the efficacy of telerehabilitation when tested in randomised trials, studies that use mixed methods to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of telehealth interventions are incredibly valuable in measuring outcomes.","This review aimed to gather evidence for the use of telerehabilitation after stroke. We aimed to compare telerehabilitation with therapy delivered face-to-face and with no therapy (usual care).
Stroke is a common cause of disability in adults. After a stroke, it is common for the individual to have difficulty managing everyday activities such as walking, showering, dressing, and participating in community activities. Many people need rehabilitation after stroke; this is usually provided by healthcare professionals in a hospital or clinic setting. Recent studies have investigated whether it is possible to use technologies such as the telephone or the Internet to help people communicate with healthcare professionals without having to leave their home. This approach, which is called telerehabilitation, may be a more convenient and less expensive way of providing rehabilitation. Telerehabilitation may be used to improve a range of outcomes including physical functioning and mood. We searched for studies in June 2019 and identified 22 studies involving 1937 people after stroke. The studies used a wide range of treatments, including therapy programmes designed to improve arm function and ability to walk and programmes designed to provide counselling and support for people upon leaving hospital after stroke. As the studies were very different, it was rarely appropriate to combine results to determine overall effect. We found that people who received telerehabilitation had similar outcomes for activities of daily living function to those that received face-to-face therapy and those that received no therapy (usual care). At this point, not enough research has been done to show whether telerehabilitation is a more effective way to provide rehabilitation. Some studies report that telerehabilitation is less expensive to provide but information is lacking about cost-effectiveness. Only two trials reported on whether or not any adverse events had occurred; these trials found no serious adverse events were related to telerehabilitation. Further trials are required. The quality of the evidence was generally of low or moderate quality.",1063,Telerehabilitation; in-person rehabilitation; activities of daily living; stroke survivors; mobility; cognitive function; adverse events; depressive symptoms,What motivations for exploring telerehabilitation were highlighted by the study?,What were the main objectives of the telerehabilitation study?,Select all of the following that are colors,What were the findings regarding activities of daily living when comparing telerehabilitation to traditional methods?,"According to the summary, how did telerehabilitation impact participants' mood compared to face-to-face therapy?",To find a more convenient and less expensive way of providing rehabilitation.; To demonstrate the superiority of face-to-face therapy.; To establish telerehabilitation as a standard practice immediately.,To find a more convenient and less expensive way of providing rehabilitation.,To compare telerehabilitation with face-to-face therapy and usual care; To eliminate the need for stroke rehabilitation; To develop new medications for stroke,To compare telerehabilitation with face-to-face therapy and usual care,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Similar outcomes were found for both methods; Telerehabilitation was significantly more effective; Traditional methods were found to be ineffective,Similar outcomes were found for both methods,No significant changes in mood were reported; Telerehabilitation led to significant mood improvement; Face-to-face therapy worsened participants' mood,No significant changes in mood were reported
5b9dd07de671c60001226b79,finetuned_5,Quality improvement strategies for diabetes care: Effects on outcomes for adults living with diabetes,"There is a large body of evidence evaluating quality improvement (QI) programmes to improve care for adults living with diabetes. These programmes are often comprised of multiple QI strategies, which may be implemented in various combinations. Decision-makers planning to implement or evaluate a new QI programme, or both, need reliable evidence on the relative effectiveness of different QI strategies (individually and in combination) for different patient populations.
To update existing systematic reviews of diabetes QI programmes and apply novel meta-analytical techniques to estimate the effectiveness of QI strategies (individually and in combination) on diabetes quality of care.
We searched databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL) and trials registers (ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP) to 4 June 2019. We conducted a top-up search to 23 September 2021; we screened these search results and 42 studies meeting our eligibility criteria are available in the awaiting classification section.
We included randomised trials that assessed a QI programme to improve care in outpatient settings for people living with diabetes. QI programmes needed to evaluate at least one system- or provider-targeted QI strategy alone or in combination with a patient-targeted strategy. - System-targeted: case management (CM); team changes (TC); electronic patient registry (EPR); facilitated relay of clinical information (FR); continuous quality improvement (CQI). - Provider-targeted: audit and feedback (AF); clinician education (CE); clinician reminders (CR); financial incentives (FI). - Patient-targeted: patient education (PE); promotion of self-management (PSM); patient reminders (PR). Patient-targeted QI strategies needed to occur with a minimum of one provider or system-targeted strategy.
We dual-screened search results and abstracted data on study design, study population and QI strategies. We assessed the impact of the programmes on 13 measures of diabetes care, including: glycaemic control (e.g. mean glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c)); cardiovascular risk factor management (e.g. mean systolic blood pressure (SBP), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), proportion of people living with diabetes that quit smoking or receiving cardiovascular medications); and screening/prevention of microvascular complications (e.g. proportion of patients receiving retinopathy or foot screening); and harms (e.g. proportion of patients experiencing adverse hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia). We modelled the association of each QI strategy with outcomes using a series of hierarchical multivariable meta-regression models in a Bayesian framework. The previous version of this review identified that different strategies were more or less effective depending on baseline levels of outcomes. To explore this further, we extended the main additive model for continuous outcomes (HbA1c, SBP and LDL-C) to include an interaction term between each strategy and average baseline risk for each study (baseline thresholds were based on a data-driven approach; we used the median of all baseline values reported in the trials). Based on model diagnostics, the baseline interaction models for HbA1c, SBP and LDL-C performed better than the main model and are therefore presented as the primary analyses for these outcomes. Based on the model results, we qualitatively ordered each QI strategy within three tiers (Top, Middle, Bottom) based on its magnitude of effect relative to the other QI strategies, where 'Top' indicates that the QI strategy was likely one of the most effective strategies for that specific outcome. Secondary analyses explored the sensitivity of results to choices in model specification and priors. Additional information about the methods and results of the review are available as Appendices in an online repository. This review will be maintained as a living systematic review; we will update our syntheses as more data become available.
We identified 553 trials (428 patient-randomised and 125 cluster-randomised trials), including a total of 412,161 participants. Of the included studies, 66% involved people living with type 2 diabetes only. Participants were 50% female and the median age of participants was 58.4 years. The mean duration of follow-up was 12.5 months. HbA1c was the commonest reported outcome; screening outcomes and outcomes related to cardiovascular medications, smoking and harms were reported infrequently. The most frequently evaluated QI strategies across all study arms were PE, PSM and CM, while the least frequently evaluated QI strategies included AF, FI and CQI. Our confidence in the evidence is limited due to a lack of information on how studies were conducted. Four QI strategies (CM, TC, PE, PSM) were consistently identified as 'Top' across the majority of outcomes. All QI strategies were ranked as 'Top' for at least one key outcome. The majority of effects of individual QI strategies were modest, but when used in combination could result in meaningful population-level improvements across the majority of outcomes. The median number of QI strategies in multicomponent QI programmes was three. Combinations of the three most effective QI strategies were estimated to lead to the below effects: - PR + PSM + CE: decrease in HbA1c by 0.41% (credibility interval (CrI) -0.61 to -0.22) when baseline HbA1c < 8.3%; - CM + PE + EPR: decrease in HbA1c by 0.62% (CrI -0.84 to -0.39) when baseline HbA1c > 8.3%; - PE + TC + PSM: reduction in SBP by 2.14 mmHg (CrI -3.80 to -0.52) when baseline SBP < 136 mmHg; - CM + TC + PSM: reduction in SBP by 4.39 mmHg (CrI -6.20 to -2.56) when baseline SBP > 136 mmHg; - TC + PE + CM: LDL-C lowering of 5.73 mg/dL (CrI -7.93 to -3.61) when baseline LDL < 107 mg/dL; - TC + CM + CR: LDL-C lowering by 5.52 mg/dL (CrI -9.24 to -1.89) when baseline LDL > 107 mg/dL. Assuming a baseline screening rate of 50%, the three most effective QI strategies were estimated to lead to an absolute improvement of 33% in retinopathy screening (PE + PR + TC) and 38% absolute increase in foot screening (PE + TC + Other).
There is a significant body of evidence about QI programmes to improve the management of diabetes. Multicomponent QI programmes for diabetes care (comprised of effective QI strategies) may achieve meaningful population-level improvements across the majority of outcomes. For health system decision-makers, the evidence summarised in this review can be used to identify strategies to include in QI programmes. For researchers, this synthesis identifies higher-priority QI strategies to examine in further research regarding how to optimise their evaluation and effects. We will maintain this as a living systematic review.","Diabetes, a disorder of how sugar is managed by the body, can lead to complications such as heart disease and blindness. If people with diabetes get the best possible treatment, their risk for these and other diabetes-related complications will be lowered. Unfortunately, many people with diabetes do not get the best possible treatment.
Quality improvement programmes using different strategies help healthcare professionals improve care. We examined 12 common types of quality improvement strategies.
- Four strategies were directed at healthcare professionals: audit and feedback, clinician education, clinician reminders and financial incentives.
- Three strategies were directed at people living with diabetes: patient education, patient reminders and promotion of self-management.
- Five strategies involved healthcare organisations: case management, team changes, electronic patient registry, facilitated relay of clinical information and continuous quality improvement.
We wanted to find out which strategies worked best to improve:
- blood sugar control (measured using a test called glycated haemoglobin or HbA1c);
- blood pressure;
- low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C).
Lower levels on these tests are associated with lower rates of complications such as heart attacks.
We also assessed whether quality improvement strategies improved rates of screening for eye damage (also known as retinopathy) and loss of sensation in the foot (also known as neuropathy). Routine screening for these issues in people living with diabetes is recommended to prevent blindness or amputation, respectively.
We searched for randomised trials including adults living with diabetes managed in outpatient settings, which evaluated at least one quality improvement strategy. Although we were interested in strategies directed at people living with diabetes, patient strategies needed to be tested in combination with strategies directed at healthcare organisations or professionals for the study to be included. We summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods, size and other considerations.
We found 553 studies that involved 412,161 people with diabetes up to the year 2019. Studies took place in countries around the world with most being conducted in the USA (231) and in medical settings.
Most studies (367) involved people with type 2 diabetes. Half of the study participants were female. The average age of participants was 57 years. Most studies lasted 12 months.
Studies usually used multiple quality improvement strategies together. Most commonly, studies featured three quality improvement strategies.
Overall, case management, team changes, patient education and promotion of self-management appeared to be the most effective quality improvement strategies for diabetes care.
When considering three-strategy combinations (the median number of quality improvement strategies in multicomponent interventions), the combination of clinician education, promotion of self-management and patient reminders may lead to the most improvement in blood sugar control in people who begin with lower HbA1c. Whereas the combination of case management, patient education and electronic patient registries may lead to the largest improvement in blood sugar control for people who begin with higher HbA1c.
For blood pressure, people who have lower systolic blood pressure may see the most improvement with the combination of patient education, team changes and promotion of self-management. People who have higher systolic blood pressure may improve the most with the combination of case management, team changes and promotion of self-management.
For cholesterol, we found that team changes, patient education and case management may lead to the most improvement in people who already have lower low-density lipoprotein levels. For those who have higher levels of low-density lipoprotein, team changes, case management and clinician reminders may lead to the largest improvement.
Patient education, patient reminders and team changes may lead to an increase in retinopathy screening rates. Patient education, team changes and audit and feedback, financial incentives and continuous quality improvement strategies combined may lead to an increase in foot screening rates.
Clinics can improve their diabetes care by engaging in quality improvement programmes (especially those including case management, team changes, patient education and patient self-management).
Many studies did not provide information on everything we were interested in. Most focused on blood sugar control and few studies reported screening rates. We included studies in this review that had important flaws in the way they were conducted, which limits how confident we can be in our findings.
The evidence for this review is up-to-date to June 2019, and we have further searched for and screened studies up to September 2021.

5b9dd07de671c60001226b79,finetuned_6,Blood pressure drugs for preventing stroke and cardiovascular diseases in patients with a stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA),"Stroke is an important cause of death and disability worldwide. Since high blood pressure is an important risk factor for stroke and stroke recurrence, drugs that lower blood pressure might play an important role in secondary stroke prevention.
To investigate whether blood pressure-lowering drugs (BPLDs) started at least 48 hours after the index event are effective for the prevention of recurrent stroke, major vascular events, and dementia in people with stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA). Secondary objectives were to identify subgroups of people in which BPLDs are effective, and to investigate the optimum systolic blood pressure target after stroke or TIA for preventing recurrent stroke, major vascular events, and dementia.
In August 2017, we searched the Trials Registers of the Cochrane Stroke Group and the Cochrane Hypertension Group, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 8), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to August 2017), Embase Ovid (1974 to August 2017), ClinicalTrials.gov, the ISRCTN Registry, Stroke Trials Registry, Trials Central, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform Portal.
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of BPLDs started at least 48 hours after stroke or TIA.
Two review authors independently screened all titles and abstracts, selected eligible trials, extracted the data, assessed risk of bias, and used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence. If necessary, we contacted the principal investigators or corresponding authors for additional data.
We included 11 studies involving a total of 38,742 participants: eight studies compared BPLDs versus placebo or no treatment (35,110 participants), and three studies compared different systolic blood pressure targets (3632 participants). The risk of bias varied greatly between included studies. The pooled risk ratio (RR) of BPLDs for recurrent stroke was 0.81 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70 to 0.93; 8 RCTs; 35,110 participants; moderate-quality evidence), for major vascular event 0.90 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.04; 4 RCTs; 28,630 participants; high-quality evidence), and for dementia 0.88 (95% CI 0.73 to 1.06; 2 RCTs; 6671 participants; high-quality evidence). We mainly observed a reduced risk of recurrent stroke in the subgroup of participants using an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or a diuretic (I2statistic for subgroup differences 72.1%; P = 0.006). The pooled RR of intensive blood pressure-lowering for recurrent stroke was 0.80 (95% CI 0.63 to 1.00), and for major vascular event 0.58 (95% CI 0.23 to 1.46).
Our results support the use of BPLDs in people with stroke or TIA for reducing the risk of recurrent stroke. Current evidence is primarily derived from trials studying an ACE inhibitor or a diuretic. No definite conclusions can be drawn from current evidence regarding an optimal systolic blood pressure target after stroke or TIA.","Do blood pressure drugs prevent stroke, other blood vessel diseases, and dementia, in people with a stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA)? What blood pressure target is best for preventing stroke, other blood vessel diseases, and dementia, in people with a stroke or TIA?
Stroke, due to blocked or bleeding blood vessels in the brain affects about 14 million people worldwide each year. Stroke survivors are at increased risk of recurrent stroke, other blood vessel diseases, and dementia. High blood pressure is an important risk factor that can increase this risk. Blood pressure-lowering drugs are known to prevent first ever stroke. However, in stroke survivors lowering the blood pressure too far (using blood pressure drugs) may be harmful especially early after the stroke. Therefore, we reviewed trials that tested blood pressure-lowering drugs started at least 48 hours after the stroke or TIA.
Study characteristics : this review is up-to-date to August 2017. We included 11 trials involving 38,742 participants: eight trials assessed the effect of blood pressure drugs, and three trials compared different blood pressure targets. Ten studies were hospital-based and one trial was performed in a general practitioner setting. Not all trials contributed information to all outcomes.
Key results : blood pressure drugs lowered the risk of recurrent stroke in patients with a stroke or TIA, whereas there is insufficient evidence to conclude whether they reduce the risk of other blood vessel diseases and dementia. There is also insufficient evidence to conclude which blood pressure target is best for patients with a stroke or TIA.
Quality of the evidence : overall, the quality of the trials in this review was moderate. However, we found similar results in an analysis using only high-quality trials. More research is needed to investigate whether blood pressure drugs also prevent dementia, and what blood pressure targets are best for patients with a stroke or TIA.",1070,Stroke; transient ischaemic attack; blood pressure-lowering drugs; secondary stroke prevention; major vascular events; dementia; angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor; diuretic; systolic blood pressure target; intensive blood pressure-lowering,How should the results be evaluated in terms of their significance for clinical practice?,What was the main goal of the study regarding blood pressure-lowering drugs?,Select all of the following that are fruits,What did the study use blood pressure-lowering drugs for?,How is the evidence quality of the trials described in the summary?,"The results are pivotal as they highlight potential reduced recurrence with certain drugs.; Due to moderate evidence, results should not impact current clinical practice.; Results show conclusive evidence for broad-spectrum BP targets.",The results are pivotal as they highlight potential reduced recurrence with certain drugs.,To determine if they prevent recurrent stroke in people with a stroke or TIA; To find out if they can be used to treat high blood pressure in general; To examine if they are effective in preventing first-ever stroke,To determine if they prevent recurrent stroke in people with a stroke or TIA,dog; blue; grape,grape,To lower the risk of recurrent stroke; To increase blood flow in the brain; To raise blood pressure levels,To lower the risk of recurrent stroke,Moderate; High; Low,Moderate
5b9dd07de671c60001226b79,finetuned_6,Statins can help reduce risk of death in people with chronic kidney disease who do not need dialysis,"Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in people with early-stage chronic kidney disease (CKD), and their absolute risk of cardiovascular events is similar to that of people with coronary artery disease. This updated review evaluated whether statins benefit adults with CKD not requiring dialysis by reducing cardiovascular events, death, or kidney decline, compared with placebo, no treatment, usual care, or other statins. We included 63 studies involving 50,725 participants, most of which compared statins with placebo or no treatment, with a median follow-up of 12 months and typical doses equivalent to 20 mg/day of simvastatin. Participants had a median eGFR of 55 mL/min/1.73 m2. Across 43 studies that could be meta-analysed, statins clearly reduced major cardiovascular events, with a 28% relative reduction, and reduced overall death and cardiovascular death. Statins also lowered the risk of myocardial infarction, though data were insufficient to determine whether they influenced hospitalisations for heart failure. Statins probably made little or no difference in preventing stroke or kidney failure in people with CKD not on dialysis. Evidence on harms was limited due to insufficient reporting, but available data suggest statins may have little or no effect on elevated liver enzymes, withdrawals due to side effects, or cancer. Too few studies reported rhabdomyolysis or elevated creatine kinase to determine whether statins increase these risks. Statins showed clear benefits when used for primary prevention, reducing death and major cardiovascular events in people with CKD who did not have cardiovascular disease at baseline. However, there were insufficient data to determine whether one statin was better than another. Overall, statins reduce the risk of death and major cardiovascular events in people with CKD not requiring dialysis, while their effects on muscle-related toxicity remain uncertain due to limited reporting.","Adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have a high risk of cardiovascular events, with elevated serum cholesterol and triglycerides, a factor that contributes to cardiovascular disease. Statin therapy helps to lower the level of bad cholesterol (low-density lipoprotein) and has cardiovascular protective effects beyond cholesterol reduction. For people not needing dialysis, statin therapy has been shown to reduce death and cardiovascular events. Still, studies in this population have shown unclear effects on stroke, kidney failure, and harms such as muscle damage (rhabdomyolysis).
We looked at 62 studies published before 4 October 2023 concerning statins in over 50,000 people with CKD who did not need dialysis treatment. This review is a living systematic review. A search for new evidence will be conducted every three months, and the review will be updated accordingly. We found that compared to placebo, statin therapy reduced death and major heart-related events, with one in 13 people receiving statin therapy avoiding heart-related events and one in 26 people avoiding death. Statin therapy probably had little or no effect on stroke and kidney failure (when people would benefit from dialysis or a kidney transplant). The benefits of statin therapy were also evident in patients with CKD but not heart disease. Statins have some potential harms; however, we found there was probably no effect on cancer, liver function or withdrawing from treatment due to adverse events. There was limited reporting of muscle damage in the studies. Studies did not identify a preferred type or dose of statin in treating people with CKD not requiring dialysis. Statins decrease death, major cardiovascular events, and myocardial infarction in people with moderate CKD.

66497704c55b6a0ac500cb61,static_1,Bisphosphonates and denosumab for breast cancer,"Bone is the most common site of metastatic disease associated with breast cancer (BC). Bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, and novel targeted therapies such as denosumab inhibit other key bone metabolism pathways. We have studied these agents in both early breast cancer and advanced breast cancer settings. This is an update of the review originally published in 2002 and subsequently updated in 2005 and 2012.
To assess the effects of bisphosphonates and other bone agents in addition to anti-cancer treatment: (i) in women with early breast cancer (EBC); (ii) in women with advanced breast cancer without bone metastases (ABC); and (iii) in women with metastatic breast cancer and bone metastases (BCBM).
In this review update, we searched Cochrane Breast Cancer's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov on 19 September 2016.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing: (a) one treatment with a bisphosphonate/bone-acting agent with the same treatment without a bisphosphonate/bone-acting agent; (b) treatment with one bisphosphonate versus treatment with a different bisphosphonate; (c) treatment with a bisphosphonate versus another bone-acting agent of a different mechanism of action (e.g. denosumab); and (d) immediate treatment with a bisphosphonate/bone-acting agent versus delayed treatment of the same bisphosphonate/bone-acting agent.
Two review authors independently extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and quality of the evidence. The primary outcome measure was bone metastases for EBC and ABC, and a skeletal-related event (SRE) for BCBM. We derived risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and the meta-analyses used random-effects models. Secondary outcomes included overall survival and disease-free survival for EBC; we derived hazard ratios (HRs) for these time-to-event outcomes where possible. We collected toxicity and quality-of-life information. GRADE was used to assess the quality of evidence for the most important outcomes in each treatment setting.
We included 44 RCTs involving 37,302 women. In women with EBC, bisphosphonates were associated with a reduced risk of bone metastases compared to placebo/no bisphosphonate (RR 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75 to 0.99; P = 0.03, 11 studies; 15,005 women; moderate-quality evidence with no significant heterogeneity). Bisphosphonates provided an overall survival benefit with time-to-event data (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.99; P = 0.04; 9 studies; 13,949 women; high-quality evidence with evidence of heterogeneity). Subgroup analysis by menopausal status showed a survival benefit from bisphosphonates in postmenopausal women (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.90; P = 0.001; 4 studies; 6048 women; high-quality evidence with no evidence of heterogeneity) but no survival benefit for premenopausal women (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.22; P = 0.78; 2 studies; 3501 women; high-quality evidence with no heterogeneity). There was evidence of no effect of bisphosphonates on disease-free survival (HR 0.94, 95% 0.87 to 1.02; P = 0.13; 7 studies; 12,578 women; high-quality evidence with significant heterogeneity present) however subgroup analyses showed a disease-free survival benefit from bisphosphonates in postmenopausal women only (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.91; P < 0.001; 7 studies; 8314 women; high-quality evidence with no heterogeneity). Bisphosphonates did not significantly reduce the incidence of fractures when compared to placebo/no bisphosphonates (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.08, P = 0.13, 6 studies, 7602 women; moderate-quality evidence due to wide confidence intervals). We await mature overall survival and disease-free survival results for denosumab trials. In women with ABC without clinically evident bone metastases, there was no evidence of an effect of bisphosphonates on bone metastases (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.43; P = 0.86; 3 studies; 330 women; moderate-quality evidence with no heterogeneity) or overall survival (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.09; P = 0.28; 3 studies; 330 women; high-quality evidence with no heterogeneity) compared to placebo/no bisphosphonates however the confidence intervals were wide. One study reported a trend towards an extended period of time without a SRE with bisphosphonate compared to placebo (low-quality evidence). One study reported quality of life and there was no apparent difference in scores between bisphosphonate and placebo (moderate-quality evidence). In women with BCBM, bisphosphonates reduced the SRE risk by 14% (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.95; P = 0.003; 9 studies; 2810 women; high-quality evidence with evidence of heterogeneity) compared with placebo/no bisphosphonates. This benefit persisted when administering either intravenous or oral bisphosphonates versus placebo. Bisphosphonates delayed the median time to a SRE with a median ratio of 1.43 (95% CI 1.29 to 1.58; P < 0.00001; 9 studies; 2891 women; high-quality evidence with no heterogeneity) and reduced bone pain (in 6 out of 11 studies; moderate-quality evidence) compared to placebo/no bisphosphonate. Treatment with bisphosphonates did not appear to affect overall survival (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.11; P = 0.85; 7 studies; 1935 women; moderate-quality evidence with significant heterogeneity). Quality-of-life scores were slightly better with bisphosphonates than placebo at comparable time points (in three out of five studies; moderate-quality evidence) however scores decreased during the course of the studies. Denosumab reduced the risk of developing a SRE compared with bisphosphonates by 22% (RR 0.78, 0.72 to 0.85; P < 0.001; 3 studies, 2345 women). One study reported data on overall survival and observed no difference in survival between denosumab and bisphosphonate. Reported toxicities across all settings were generally mild. Osteonecrosis of the jaw was rare, occurring less than 0.5% in the adjuvant setting (high-quality evidence).
For women with EBC, bisphosphonates reduce the risk of bone metastases and provide an overall survival benefit compared to placebo or no bisphosphonates. There is preliminary evidence suggestive that bisphosphonates provide an overall survival and disease-free survival benefit in postmenopausal women only when compared to placebo or no bisphosphonate. This was not a planned subgroup for these early trials, and we await the completion of new large clinical trials assessing benefit for postmenopausal women. For women with BCBM, bisphosphonates reduce the risk of developing SREs, delay the median time to an SRE, and appear to reduce bone pain compared to placebo or no bisphosphonate.","Breast cancer may spread and recur in the bones. This may cause fractures, pain and high calcium in the bloodstream (known as complications).
Medicines for osteoporosis may prevent these complications and may help cure cancer by reducing cancer growth in the bone. These medicines are called 'bisphosphonates'. A newer type is called  denosumab. Bisphosphonates or denosumab are given in addition to other cancer treatment medications. These may be given along with chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, or radiotherapy.
The goal of bisphosphonates and denosumab differs based on the women's breast cancer status.
We asked three main questions:
1. For women with early breast cancer (EBC) , can bisphosphonates or denosumab reduce the risk of the cancer spreading to the bone? Will adding this medicine to anticancer treatments allow women to live longer (improve survival)?
2. For women with advanced breast cancer which does not appear to involve the bone (ABC) , can bisphosphonates reduce the risk of the cancer spreading to the bone and improve survival? Will bisphosphonates reduce complications and improve quality of life?
3. For women with metastatic breast cancer that has spread to the bone (BCBM), can bisphosphonates or denosumab reduce the risk of complication, and improve quality of life and survival?
We found 44 studies involving 37,302 participants. We included studies published by September 2016.
For women with EBC, we included 17 studies with 26,129 participants. The women's health was monitored for at least 12 months from the start of the study. Some studies monitored women for 10 years.
The studies tested different types of bisphosphonate drugs and denosumab, and different doses of these drugs. Some studies compared the drugs to no treatment. Some studies used oral medications. Other studies gave the medicine as an injection into a vein or under the skin.
Bisphosphonates probably lowered the risk of cancer spreading to the bone.
Bisphosphonates were found to improve survival, but the benefit in the whole group of women was small. Postmenopausal women had a benefit from bisphosphonates with improved survival and reduced risk of cancer returning. Premenopausal women did not have improved survival or reduced risk of the cancer returning. New studies that test bisphosphonates by the women's menopausal status are awaited.
We await the reporting of data on survival and other important outcomes from denosumab trials.
For women with ABC that had not spread to the bone, we included three studies enrolling 330 participants. All three studies compared oral bisphosphonates to no treatment.
Bisphosphonates did not reduce the risk of cancer spreading to the bone or improve survival. Very little information was available on complications and quality of life from only one study.
For women with BCBM, we included 24 studies enrolling 10,853 participants. Their health was monitored for at least 12 months. Some women were followed for 24 months. Most studies compared bisphosphonates to receiving no medication.
Bisphosphonates reduced complications (fractures and bone pain). Bisphosphonates did not appear to increase the length of time women survived. Quality of life scores were slightly better for women receiving bisphosphonates compared to similar women having no bisphosphonates.
Denosumab reduced the risk of complications compared to bisphosphonates in the three studies that collected these data. There was no benefit in survival from denosumab in the one study that collected data.
Side effects were uncommon and mild. There was a rare risk of damage to the jaw bone (osteonecrosis of the jaw).

66497704c55b6a0ac500cb61,static_2,Use of medication to treat depression in people with opioid dependence,"Lifetime prevalence of depression in subjects with opioid dependence is higher than in the general population (44-54% versus 16%) and represents a risk factor for morbidity and mortality. For patients on opioid agonist treatment, current prevalence rates of depression ranges between 10 and 30%, influencing negatively the outcome of the treatment. To evaluate the efficacy and the acceptability of antidepressants for the treatment of depressed opioid dependents treated with opioid agonists. We searched Pubmed, EMBASE, CINAHL (to October 2009), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library Cochrane Drug and Alcohol Group Specialised Register, issue 4, 2009), main electronic sources of ongoing trials, specific trial databases and reference lists of all relevant papers. Randomised and controlled clinical trials examining the efficacy of any antidepressant medication to treat depressed opioid dependents in treatment with opioid agonists. Two authors independently screened and extracted data from studies. Seven studies, 482 participants, met the inclusion criteria.  Comparing antidepressant with placebo, no statistically significant results for dropouts. Selecting studies with low risk of bias, 325 participants, results favour placebo, RR 1.40 (Cl 95% 1.00 to 1.96). For severity of depression, results from two studies, 183 participants, favour antidepressants utilising Clinical Global Impression Scale RR 1.92 (CI 95% 1.26 to 2.94), while another study, 95 participants, utilising the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, did not find a statistically significant difference RR 0.96 (CI 95% 0.54 to 1.71). For adverse events, result favour placebo, four studies, 311 participants, RR 2.90 (Cl 95% 1.23 to 6.86). For drug use, three studies, 211 participants, it was not possible to pool data because outcomes' measures were not comparable. Looking at singular studies, no statistically significant difference was seen. - Comparing different classes of antidepressants, the results favour tricyclics for severity of depression, two studies, 183 participants, RR 1.92 (Cl 95% 1.26 to 2.94) and favour placebo for adverse events, two studies, 172 participants, RR 3.11 (Cl 95% 1.06 to 9.12). There is low evidence, at the present, supporting the clinical use of antidepressants for the treatment of depressed opioid addicts in treatment with opioid agonists. There is a need of larger randomised studies investigating relevant outcomes, safety issues and reporting data to allow comparison of results.","There is little evidence to support the use of antidepressants for treating people who are dependent on opioids and have clinical depression. Depression is more common in people with substance abuse and dependence than in the general population. The depression experienced is also associated with an increased risk of completed suicide. Depression may represent an independent disorder, the psychosocial stress associated with addictive behavior or it could be a consequence of drug use and drug withdrawal effects. A maintenance program with opioid agonists (methadone, buprenorphine, LAAM) is an effective treatment for people who are dependent on opioids in terms of retention in treatment and reduced use of opioids. Depression is however still prevalent and negatively impacts on treatment outcomes. Treatment with antidepressant drugs has therefore been proposed. These adjunct drug treatments include tricyclic antidepressants (doxepin, desipramine, imipramine) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs fluoxetine, sertraline). Authors included seven randomised controlled studies that involved 482 participants in our review. The studies were conducted in outpatient settings over four to 16 weeks; six were in USA and one in Australia. The mean age of participants was 34 years and 62% were males. No clear difference was found in the number of dropouts from an opioid agonist maintenance program between people receiving antidepressants and those in the placebo groups. Neither was drug use different (two studies). Severity of depression was reduced with the use of antidepressants (two studies), including tricyclic antidepressants. Adverse events were important as more of the participants who received antidepressants withdrew from the studies for medical reasons compared with those participants on placebo (four studies). The differences between studies in clinical (participant characteristics, the medications used, services and treatments delivered) and methodological characteristics (study design and quality) made it difficult to draw confident conclusions about the efficacy and safety of antidepressants for the treatment of depression in people who are dependent on opioids.",1118,depression; opioid dependence; opioid agonist treatment; antidepressants; tricyclics; adverse events,How does the presence of depression influence the outcomes of opioid agonist treatments according to the study?,What criteria should future studies meet to improve evidence on the efficacy of antidepressants for opioid-dependent individuals?,Select all of the following that are colors,What is the main conclusion about antidepressant use for opioid dependents?,"In the summary, how did adverse events affect antidepressant use in the studies?",It enhances the retention of participants in treatment programs.; It negatively impacts the treatment outcomes.; It has no significant impact on treatment outcomes.,It negatively impacts the treatment outcomes.,Larger randomized trials with relevant outcome reporting.; Increased focus on drug misuse prevention.; Studies with diverse participant characteristics.,Larger randomized trials with relevant outcome reporting.; Studies with diverse participant characteristics.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Little evidence supports their use; They are highly recommended; They completely cure both addiction and depression,Little evidence supports their use,They led to more study withdrawals; They had no impact on the studies; They improved retention in studies,They led to more study withdrawals
66497704c55b6a0ac500cb61,static_2,Exercise training for bronchiectasis,"Bronchiectasis is characterised by excessive sputum production, chronic cough, and acute exacerbations and is associated with symptoms of dyspnoea and fatigue, which reduce exercise tolerance and impair quality of life. Exercise training in isolation or in conjunction with other interventions is beneficial for people with other respiratory diseases, but its effects in bronchiectasis have not been well established.
To determine effects of exercise training compared to usual care on exercise tolerance (primary outcome), quality of life (primary outcome), incidence of acute exacerbation and hospitalisation, respiratory and mental health symptoms, physical function, mortality, and adverse events in people with stable or acute exacerbation of bronchiectasis.
We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Specialised Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization trials portal, from their inception to October 2020. We reviewed respiratory conference abstracts and reference lists of all primary studies and review articles for additional references.
We included randomised controlled trials in which exercise training of at least four weeks' duration (or eight sessions) was compared to usual care for people with stable bronchiectasis or experiencing an acute exacerbation. Co-interventions with exercise training including education, respiratory muscle training, and airway clearance therapy were permitted if also applied as part of usual care.
Two review authors independently screened and selected trials for inclusion, extracted outcome data, and assessed risk of bias. We contacted study authors for missing data. We calculated mean differences (MDs) using a random-effects model. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence.
We included six studies, two of which were published as abstracts, with a total of 275 participants. Five studies were undertaken with people with clinically stable bronchiectasis, and one pilot study was undertaken post acute exacerbation. All studies included co-interventions such as instructions for airway clearance therapy and/or breathing strategies, provision of an educational booklet, and delivery of educational sessions. The duration of training ranged from six to eight weeks, with a mix of supervised and unsupervised sessions conducted in the outpatient or home setting. No studies of children were included in the review; however we identified two studies as currently ongoing. No data were available regarding physical activity levels or adverse events. For people with stable bronchiectasis, evidence suggests that exercise training compared to usual care improves functional exercise tolerance as measured by the incremental shuttle walk distance, with a mean difference (MD) between groups of 87 metres (95% confidence interval (CI) 43 to 132 metres; 4 studies, 161 participants; low-certainty evidence). Evidence also suggests that exercise training improves six-minute walk distance (6MWD) (MD between groups of 42 metres, 95% CI 22 to 62; 1 study, 76 participants; low-certainty evidence). The magnitude of these observed mean changes appears clinically relevant as they exceed minimal clinically important difference (MCID) thresholds for people with chronic lung disease. Evidence suggests that quality of life improves following exercise training according to St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score (MD -9.62 points, 95% CI -15.67 to -3.56 points; 3 studies, 160 participants; low-certainty evidence), which exceeds the MCID of 4 points for this outcome. A reduction in dyspnoea (MD 1.0 points, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.53; 1 study, 76 participants) and fatigue (MD 1.51 points, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.22 points; 1 study, 76 participants) was observed following exercise training according to these domains of the Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire. However, there was no change in cough-related quality of life as measured by the Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ) (MD -0.09 points, 95% CI -0.98 to 0.80 points; 2 studies, 103 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), nor in anxiety or depression. Two studies reported longer-term outcomes up to 12 months after intervention completion; however exercise training did not appear to improve exercise capacity or quality of life more than usual care. Exercise training reduced the number of acute exacerbations of bronchiectasis over 12 months in people with stable bronchiectasis (odds ratio 0.26, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.81; 1 study, 55 participants). After an acute exacerbation of bronchiectasis, data from a single study (N = 27) suggest that exercise training compared to usual care confers little to no effect on exercise capacity (MD 11 metres, 95% CI -27 to 49 metres; low-certainty evidence), SGRQ total score (MD 6.34 points, 95%CI -17.08 to 29.76 points), or LCQ score (MD -0.08 points, 95% CI -0.94 to 0.78 points; low-certainty evidence) and does not reduce the time to first exacerbation (hazard ratio 0.83, 95% CI 0.31 to 2.22).
This review provides low-certainty evidence suggesting improvement in functional exercise capacity and quality of life immediately following exercise training in people with stable bronchiectasis; however the effects of exercise training on cough-related quality of life and psychological symptoms appear to be minimal. Due to inadequate reporting of methods, small study numbers, and variation between study findings, evidence is of very low to moderate certainty. Limited evidence is available to show longer-term effects of exercise training on these outcomes.","We wanted to know whether exercise training improves exercise tolerance, quality of life, or symptoms, and whether it reduces the number of future flare-ups (exacerbations) in people with bronchiectasis compared to those who did not participate in exercise training. We examined studies involving people with stable disease as well as those recovering from a recent flare-up, aiming to include evidence for both children and adults, although no studies involving children were found. Bronchiectasis causes chronic cough and sputum production, and people with this condition have an increased risk of exacerbations that worsen exercise tolerance and quality of life. While exercise training benefits people with other chronic lung conditions, its effects in bronchiectasis are less well understood. The evidence is current up to October 2020 and includes six studies with 275 participants, five of which involved people with stable disease. Exercise training was delivered alongside other treatments such as airway clearance therapy, respiratory muscle training, and education. Participants were randomly assigned to either exercise training or no exercise training. Training lasted at least six weeks and took place either in group settings or at home. None of the studies were funded by commercial companies. After completing exercise training, participants in a stable condition walked farther than those who did not train, with an average increase of 87 meters, although certainty of evidence is low. Participants also reported improved quality of life, less shortness of breath, and reduced fatigue. Moderate-certainty evidence showed that exercise training might not specifically improve cough-related symptoms, but the incidence of acute exacerbations was lower. Evidence was insufficient to determine whether the benefits lasted beyond the training period or whether exercise training increased overall physical activity. No benefits were observed for people who began exercise training soon after an acute flare-up. The certainty of evidence ranged from very low to moderate due to uncertainty in effect size, limitations in study design, and insufficient data. More studies with larger sample sizes are needed to understand the long-term effects of exercise training in people with bronchiectasis regardless of their clinical stability.",1074,Bronchiectasis; sputum production; dyspnoea; exercise tolerance; acute exacerbations; Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire; Leicester Cough Questionnaire; airway clearance therapy; co-interventions; minimal clinically important difference,What conclusions can be drawn about the impact of exercise training on the quality of life in bronchiectasis patients according to the summary?,"Based on the summary, what challenges remain unresolved for exercise training in bronchiectasis?",Select all of the following that are fruits,What was the primary objective of the study?,Describe the effect of exercise training on exercise tolerance in stable bronchiectasis patients.,Exercise training significantly improves the quality of life for stable bronchiectasis patients.; The improvement in quality of life is indefinite and requires further study.; Exercise training did not improve the quality of life at all.,Exercise training significantly improves the quality of life for stable bronchiectasis patients.; The improvement in quality of life is indefinite and requires further study.,Long-term benefits beyond the training period.; Initial high cost of exercise programs.; Effectiveness for people after acute flare-ups.,Long-term benefits beyond the training period.; Effectiveness for people after acute flare-ups.,dog; blue; grape,grape,To determine the effects of exercise training in people with bronchiectasis; To analyze the dietary habits of bronchiectasis patients; To evaluate the economic impact of bronchiectasis,To determine the effects of exercise training in people with bronchiectasis,Increases exercise tolerance; Decreases exercise tolerance; No effect on exercise tolerance,Increases exercise tolerance
66497704c55b6a0ac500cb61,interactive_3,Biosimilar monoclonal antibodies for cancer treatment in adults,"Biosimilars are products that contain an approved biological medicine and are similar, but not identical, to the original version (the originator). In cancer, biosimilars have been developed from the monoclonal antibodies bevacizumab, rituximab, and trastuzumab, and they are now available for treating lung, colorectal, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and breast cancers. Because biological products cannot be made identically, it is important to evaluate the clinical effects of biosimilars compared with their originators to understand their benefits and harms. We evaluated the benefits and harms of biosimilar monoclonal antibodies versus their originators in adults with cancer. We searched major medical and clinical trial databases up to February 2024 for randomized controlled trials comparing biosimilars to originators. Standard Cochrane methods were used. The primary outcomes were progression-free survival, duration of response, overall survival, pathological complete response in breast cancer, serious adverse events, and health-related quality of life. We included 55 studies with 22,046 adults: 23 studies of bevacizumab involving 10,639 participants with colorectal or lung cancer, 17 studies of rituximab involving 4412 participants with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 15 studies of trastuzumab involving 6995 participants with breast cancer. Studies took place worldwide, were mostly multicentre, and all were funded by manufacturers. Participants ranged in age from 47 to 62 years, and the percentage of women ranged from 18% to 100%. Fifteen studies used non-inferiority designs and 40 used equivalence designs. Overall risk of bias was low, with most concerns related to incomplete outcome data and selective reporting. For bevacizumab in lung or colorectal cancer, progression-free survival was likely similar between biosimilars and originators, with equal numbers per 1000 at 12 months and a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.00. Duration of response and overall survival were also likely similar, and serious adverse events showed no important differences. Health-related quality of life was evaluated in only one colorectal cancer study and results were similar. Objective response and mortality were likely similar as well. For rituximab in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, biosimilars were likely similar to originators for progression-free survival, duration of response, overall survival, serious adverse events, objective response, and mortality. No studies reported quality of life. For trastuzumab in breast cancer, biosimilars were likely similar to originators for progression-free survival, duration of response, overall survival, serious adverse events, and objective response, and may be similar for pathological complete response. No studies reported quality of life. Across bevacizumab, rituximab, and trastuzumab, biosimilars were generally similar to their originators in progression-free survival, duration of response, overall survival, serious adverse events, objective response, and mortality. Evidence for pathological complete response (trastuzumab) and quality of life (bevacizumab) was limited. Overall, evidence certainty was moderate, with imprecision being the main reason for downgrading confidence.","Biological medicines used in cancer treatment are made from living organisms and work by killing cancer cells. Biosimilars are medicines that are similar to the original biological medicine, known as the originator. Although biosimilars have slightly different structures, they target cancer cells in the same way. Originator medicines, sometimes called reference or innovator medicines, receive approval before biosimilars. Unlike generic medicines, which are chemically derived and easier to replicate, originators and biosimilars are biological medicines, making it more difficult to create identical copies. However, biosimilars are often cheaper and could improve access to effective cancer treatment if they provide similar benefits and harms. We wanted to compare the benefits and harms of bevacizumab, rituximab, and trastuzumab biosimilars with their originators. Based on the input from five people with cancer, we considered several outcomes critical for clinical decisions: the length of time cancer does not grow or spread after treatment, the length of time people remain cancer-free, overall survival, the number of people whose breast cancer disappears in tissue removed during surgery, severe unwanted effects, and well-being. We also identified outcomes important for decision-making: the number of people whose cancer shrinks or disappears, death, and the time until cancer grows or spreads or until death. We searched for studies comparing biosimilars of bevacizumab, rituximab, or trastuzumab with the originators in people with lung, colorectal, non-Hodkin's lymphoma, and breast cancers, summarized the results, and rated our confidence in the evidence. We found 55 studies with 22,046 participants, including 10,639 receiving bevacizumab for advanced or metastatic lung cancer, 4412 receiving rituximab mainly for non-Hodkin's lymphoma, and 6995 receiving trastuzumab for advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Participants were 47 to 62 years old on average, and the studies took place across Asia, Europe, and North and South America. All studies were funded by the companies manufacturing the biosimilars. Receiving biosimilars or originator medicines led to similar results overall, and we are moderately confident that biosimilars are as effective as the originators in treating cancer. We set narrow criteria to judge whether results were sufficiently similar, and while most comparisons did not fall fully within this range, overall findings still support similarity. Most studies were well conducted, but a few may have allowed participants to know which treatment they received, and some studies did not report all outcomes of interest.",1018,biosilimars; biological medicine; bevacizumab; rituximab; trastuzumab; progression-free survival; duration of response; overall survival; serious adverse events; health-related quality of life,In what way do biosimilars demonstrate their therapeutic value compared to originators?,How could a decision-maker justify the use of biosimilars in cancer treatment?,Select all of the following that are colors,Name the three monoclonal antibodies mentioned that have biosimilars.,Describe the types of cancer involved in the studies comparing biosimilars and originators.,By showing adequately similar outcomes in critical measures for decision-making.; By providing completely different benefits that improve treatment options.; By achieving perfect replication of all outcomes observed with originators.,By showing adequately similar outcomes in critical measures for decision-making.,By arguing that biosimilars provide a moderate increase in life expectancy.; By highlighting their overall similar effectiveness and lower cost.; By pointing to their identical molecular composition to originators.,By highlighting their overall similar effectiveness and lower cost.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Bevacizumab; Rituximab; Trastuzumab,Bevacizumab; Rituximab; Trastuzumab,"Lung, colorectal, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and breast cancers.; Prostate and skin cancers.; Bone and stomach cancers.","Lung, colorectal, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and breast cancers."
66497704c55b6a0ac500cb61,interactive_4,Methotrexate for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis,"Methotrexate has been used to treat patients with primary biliary cirrhosis because it possesses immunosuppressive properties, and a previous 2005 review showed that methotrexate seemed to significantly increase mortality in these patients; since then, follow-up data from the included trials have been published. This review assessed the beneficial and harmful effects of methotrexate for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. Randomised clinical trials were identified through searches of The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE (from inception to September 2009), reference list screening, and by contacting trial authors. Trials comparing methotrexate with placebo, no intervention, or another drug were included regardless of blinding, language, year, or publication status. Primary outcomes were mortality and mortality combined with liver transplantation; dichotomous outcomes were reported as relative risks (RR) and hazard ratios (HR), and continuous outcomes as mean differences (MD). Five trials were included. Four trials with 370 patients compared methotrexate with placebo or no intervention (three trials also added ursodeoxycholic acid to both groups); these trials had high risk of bias. There were no statistically significant effects of methotrexate on mortality (RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.66 to 2.64), mortality or liver transplantation combined, pruritus, fatigue, liver complications, liver biochemistry, liver histology, or adverse events. The pruritus score (MD -0.17, 95% CI -0.25 to -0.09) was significantly lower with methotrexate, while prothrombin time significantly worsened (MD 1.60 s, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.02). One trial with 85 patients compared methotrexate with colchicine and had low risk of bias; methotrexate did not significantly affect mortality, fatigue, liver biopsy findings, or adverse events, but significantly improved pruritus (MD -0.68, 95% CI -1.11 to -0.25), serum alkaline phosphatase (MD -0.41 U/L, 95% CI -0.70 to -0.12), and plasma immunoglobulin M (MD -0.47 mg/dL, 95% CI -0.74 to -0.20) compared with colchicine, while other outcomes showed no significant differences. Overall, methotrexate had no statistically significant effect on mortality or the need for liver transplantation in primary biliary cirrhosis, and although it may improve some laboratory and symptom outcomes, there is insufficient evidence to support its use for this condition.","Primary biliary cirrhosis is an uncommon chronic liver disease of unknown aetiology, affecting mostly women. It is characterised by progressive inflammation and destruction of the liver tissue, eventually progressing to liver cirrhosis and the need for liver transplantation. Methotrexate, a folic acid antagonist with immunosuppressive properties, has been used to treat patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. However, the evidence did not show a clear benefit of methotrexate on mortality or the need for liver transplantation in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. This review is based on five randomised trials; four comparing methotrexate with placebo, and one comparing methotrexate with colchicine. Methotrexate, compared with placebo, has no significant beneficial effect on mortality and the need for liver transplantation is not significantly reduced. The effects of methotrexate on pruritus, fatigue, clinical complications, liver biochemistry levels, liver histology, and adverse events were not significantly different from placebo. There may be some beneficial effect on pruritus score (ie, an objective measure of subjective feeling of pruritus), but we cannot recommend methotrexate for this indication only, taken into account possible adverse events. In the small trial comparing methotrexate versus colchicine, methotrexate seemed to work superior to colchicine, but it is not clear if this stems from the fact that methotrexate exerts beneficial effects as colchicine exerts harmful effects. In comparison with both placebo and colchicine, methotrexate was associated with large risks of mortality and adverse events, but the increase did not reach statistical significance.",1095,Methotrexate; primary biliary cirrhosis; immunosuppressive properties; liver transplantation; liver complications; liver biochemistry; liver histology; serum alkaline phosphatase; plasma immunoglobulin M; colchicine,Critically evaluate the claim that methotrexate improves pruritus scores in the context of primary biliary cirrhosis treatment.,"Design a follow-up study to address gaps identified in the methotrexate trials, considering biases and sample size.",Select all of the following that are fruits,What was the main aim of the study?,Summarize the overall conclusion about methotrexateâs efficacy from the document.,Pruritus improvement is one of the few significant outcomes and supports methotrexate use.; Improvements in pruritus are not sufficient to recommend methotrexate given possible adverse events.; Pruritus improvement could potentially mask more significant treatment failures.,Improvements in pruritus are not sufficient to recommend methotrexate given possible adverse events.; Pruritus improvement could potentially mask more significant treatment failures.,Increase sample size and ensure proper randomization to reduce potential biases.; Focus exclusively on male patients to evaluate gender-specific effects.; Include additional outcomes like quality of life and long-term survival.,Increase sample size and ensure proper randomization to reduce potential biases.; Include additional outcomes like quality of life and long-term survival.,dog; blue; grape,grape,To assess the effects of methotrexate compared to other treatments.; To explore new methods for treating liver diseases.; To compare the cost of different liver treatments.,To assess the effects of methotrexate compared to other treatments.,There is insufficient evidence to support its use for primary biliary cirrhosis.; It is recommended as a first-line treatment.; It has been proven as the most effective treatment.,There is insufficient evidence to support its use for primary biliary cirrhosis.
66497704c55b6a0ac500cb61,interactive_4,Do education programmes improve outcomes in people with both chronic kidney disease and diabetes?,"Adherence to complex regimens for people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes is often poor. Interventions to enhance adherence require intensive education and behavioural counselling. However, whether the existing evidence is scientifically rigorous and can support recommendations for routine use of educational programmes in people with CKD and diabetes is still unknown. This is an update of a review first published in 2011.
To evaluate the benefits and harms of education programmes for people with CKD and diabetes. We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 19 July 2024 using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs investigating the benefits and harms of educational programmes (information and behavioural instructions and advice given by a healthcare provider, who could be a nurse, pharmacist, educator, health professional, medical practitioner, or healthcare provider, through verbal, written, audio-recording, or computer-aided modalities) for people 18 years and older with CKD and diabetes.
Two authors independently screened the literature, determined study eligibility, assessed quality, and extracted and entered data. We expressed dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and continuous data as mean difference (MD) with 95% CI. Data were pooled using the random-effects model. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Eight studies (13 reports, 840 randomised participants) were included. The overall risk of bias was low for objective outcomes and attrition bias, unclear for selection bias, reporting bias and other biases, and high for subjective outcomes. Education programmes compared to routine care alone probably decrease glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) (4 studies, 467 participants: MD -0.42%, 95% CI -0.53 to -0.31; moderate certainty evidence; 13.5 months follow-up) and may decrease total cholesterol (179 participants: MD -0.35 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.63 to -00.07; low certainty evidence) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (179 participants: MD -0.40 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.65 to -0.14; low certainty evidence) at 18 months of follow-up. One study (83 participants) reported education programmes for people receiving dialysis who have diabetes may improve the diabetes knowledge of diagnosis, monitoring, hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia, medication with insulin, oral medication, personal health habits, diet, exercise, chronic complications, and living with diabetes and coping with stress (all low certainty evidence). There may be an improvement in the general knowledge of diabetes at the end of the intervention and at the end of the three-month follow-up (one study, 97 participants; low certainty evidence) in people with diabetes and moderately increased albuminuria (A2). In participants with diabetes and moderately increased albuminuria (A2) (one study, 97 participants), education programmes may improve a participantÃÆÃÆÃâÃÂ¢ÃÆÃâÃâÃâ¬ÃÆÃâÃâÃâ¢s beliefs in treatment effectiveness and total self-efficacy at the end of five weeks compared to routine care (low certainty evidence). Self-efficacy for in-home blood glucose monitoring and beliefs in personal control may increase at the end of the three-month follow-up (low certainty evidence). There were no differences in other self-efficacy measures. One study (100 participants) reported an education programme may increase change in behaviour for general diet, specific diet and home blood glucose monitoring at the end of treatment (low certainty evidence); however, at the end of three months of follow-up, there may be no difference in any behaviour change outcomes (all low certainty evidence). There were uncertain effects on death, serious hypoglycaemia, and kidney failure due to very low certainty evidence. No data was available for changes in kidney function (creatinine clearance, serum creatinine, doubling of serum creatinine or proteinuria). For an education programme plus multidisciplinary, co-ordinated care compared to routine care, there may be little or no difference in HbA1c, kidney failure, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), systolic or diastolic blood pressure, hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia, and LDL and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (all low certainty evidence in participants with type-2 diabetes mellitus and documented advanced diabetic nephropathy). There were no data for death, patient-orientated measures, change in kidney function (other than eGFR and albuminuria), cardiovascular disease morbidity, quality of life, or adverse events. Education programmes may improve knowledge of some areas related to diabetes care and some self-management practices. Education programmes probably decrease HbA1c in people with CKD and diabetes, but the effect on other clinical outcomes is unclear. This review only included eight studies with small sample sizes. Therefore, more randomised studies are needed to examine the efficacy of education programmes on important clinical outcomes in people with CKD and diabetes.","Chronic kidney disease (a long-term condition where the kidneys do not work effectively) and diabetes (a lifelong condition that causes a person's blood sugar level to become too high) are chronic conditions that bring on many challenges for people, particularly when they have to manage both at the same time. Diabetes can accelerate the development of kidney disease and is the leading cause of kidney failure (a condition where the kidneys no longer function well enough to keep a person alive). While sticking to complex treatment plans can be challenging, successful self-management in the early stages of kidney disease can improve outcomes later in life and delay the need for dialysis or a kidney transplant. Education programmes are any set of planned activities designed to improve a person's ability to manage their condition and delay the progression of their kidney disease. These activities can aim to improve a person's knowledge of their disease, self-care activities, and their ability to self-monitor the disease, thus encouraging and motivating them to create healthy lifestyle changes, improve their treatment compliance, and improve quality of life. We wanted to find out whether an education programme designed for people with both kidney disease and diabetes helps them understand their condition and recognise the importance of strategies aimed at slowing its progression and preventing long-term complications. We searched for randomised studies (studies in which participants are assigned randomly to two or more treatment groups) that compared education programmes to usual care for people with both kidney disease and diabetes. We compared and summarised the results and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and sizes.
We included eight studies involving 840 people 18 years or older with both kidney disease and diabetes. Four studies were undertaken in multiple centres, and four studies were performed in single centres. The duration of follow-up ranged from 12 weeks to four years. Most of the education programmes were designed to increase a person's knowledge of their condition and improve self-management behaviours. One study focused on reducing stress using mindfulness (a person's ability to be aware of where they are and what they are doing), and it was adapted to include practices for complex thoughts and feelings related to diabetes, and one study used a co-ordinated medical care approach with multiple practitioners involved in a person's care. Overall, education programmes probably lower blood glucose levels and may lower total cholesterol and blood pressure, but may make little or no difference to kidney function, abnormally low or high blood sugar, and cardiovascular disease (disorders of the heart and blood vessels). For people with diabetes on dialysis (a procedure to remove waste products and excess fluid from the blood when the kidneys stop working properly), an education programme may improve their knowledge of diabetes, self-management behaviour for checking their feet, using lotion, wearing appropriate shoes and socks, and coping with stress. For people with moderately increased protein in the urine, there may be an improvement in their general knowledge of diabetes, their confidence in monitoring their blood sugar levels at home, their beliefs in their personal control, as well as behavioural changes to their diet. There may be no behavioural changes to exercise, foot care, or quitting smoking.
We have low confidence in education programmes improving the understanding of diabetes in people with kidney disease. This is because the number of studies reporting outcomes of interest was low, and the education programmes varied, so we were unable to properly analyse the results.",1082,Chronic kidney disease; HbA1c; Low-density lipoprotein; Moderately increased albuminuria; Education programmes; Multi-disciplinary coordinated care; Estimated glomerular filtration rate; Hyperglycaemia; Diabetic nephropathy; Self-efficacy,Which factors may influence the validity of the education programme outcomes in the study?,What criteria were used to determine the study's confidence in the evidence of educational programme outcomes?,Select all of the following that are fruits,Evaluate the potential limitations of the study's findings on education programmes.,What effect do education programmes have on self-monitoring practices?,Variability in programme design and delivery.; Limited participant age range.; Inconsistent follow-up durations.,Variability in programme design and delivery.; Inconsistent follow-up durations.,Study methods and sizes.; Geographic diversity of centres.; Participant demographics.,Study methods and sizes.,dog; blue; grape,grape,Limited number of studies and participants.; Inconsistent reporting of follow-up data.; Variety in educational programme approaches.,Limited number of studies and participants.; Variety in educational programme approaches.,They may improve confidence in home blood sugar monitoring.; They may decrease interest in self-monitoring.; They significantly improve kidney function.,They may improve confidence in home blood sugar monitoring.
66497704c55b6a0ac500cb61,finetuned_5,Long-term treatment for people with persistent depression,"Persistent depressive disorder (PDD) is defined as a depressive disorder with a minimum illness duration of two years, including four diagnostic subgroups (dysthymia, chronic major depression, recurrent major depression with incomplete remission between episodes, and double depression), and persistent forms of depression represent a substantial proportion of depressive disorders, with a lifetime prevalence ranging from 3% to 6% in the Western world; growing evidence indicates that PDD responds well to several acute interventions, such as combined psychological and pharmacological treatments, yet given the high rates of relapse and recurrences of depression following response to acute treatment, long-term continuation and maintenance therapy are of great importance, and to date there has been no evidence synthesis available on continuation and maintenance treatments of PDDs. The aim of this review was to assess the effects of pharmacological and psychological (either alone or combined) continuation and maintenance treatments for persistent depressive disorder, in comparison with each other, placebo (drug/attention placebo/non-specific treatment control), and treatment as usual (TAU), with continuation treatments defined as treatments given to currently remitted people (remission is defined as depressive symptoms dropping below case level) or to people who previously responded to an antidepressant treatment, and maintenance therapy given during recovery (defined as remission lasting longer than six months). We searched Ovid MEDLINE (1950- ), Embase (1974- ), PsycINFO (1967- ) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to 28 September 2018, with an earlier search of these databases also conducted via the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trial Register (CCMD-CTR) to 11 December 2015; in addition we searched grey literature resources, ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP to 28 September 2018, screened reference lists of included studies, and contacted the first author of included studies. We included randomized (RCTs) and non-randomized controlled trials (NRCTs) in adults with formally diagnosed PDD, receiving pharmacological, psychological, or combined continuation and maintenance interventions. Two review authors independently selected studies and extracted and analyzed data; the primary efficacy outcome was relapse/recurrence rate of depression, and the primary acceptance outcome was dropout due to any reason other than relapse/recurrence; we performed random-effects meta-analyses using risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We included 10 studies (seven RCTs, three NRCTs) involving 840 participants, with five studies investigating continuation treatments and five investigating maintenance treatments; overall, the included studies were at low-to-moderate risk of bias, with the most common source of risk of bias in NRCTs being selection of reported results, and in RCTs non-blinding of outcome assessment and other bias (especially conflict of interest due to pharmaceutical sponsoring). The most common comparison was antidepressant medication versus tablet placebo (five studies), and participants taking antidepressant medication were probably less likely to relapse or to experience a recurrent episode compared to participants in the placebo group at the end of the intervention (13.9% versus 33.8%, RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.79; participants = 383; studies = 4;  I²  = 54%, moderate quality evidence); overall dropout rates may be similar between participants in the medication and placebo group (23.0% versus 25.5%, RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.39 to 2.11; RCTs = 4; participants = 386;  I²  = 64%, low quality evidence), although sensitivity analyses showed that the primary outcome (rate of relapse/recurrence) showed no evidence of a difference between groups when only including studies with low risk of bias. None of the studies compared pharmacological or psychological treatments versus TAU. One study compared psychological therapies versus attention placebo/non-specific control, and one study compared psychotherapy with medication; the results of the studies including psychotherapy might indicate that continued or maintained psychotherapy could be a useful intervention compared to no treatment or antidepressant medication, but the body of evidence for these comparisons was too small and uncertain to draw high quality conclusions. Three studies compared combined psychological and pharmacological therapies with pharmacological therapies alone, and one study compared combined psychological and pharmacological therapies with psychotherapeutic therapies alone; however, the evidence was too small and uncertain to draw any high quality conclusions. Two studies reported data on the direct comparison of two antidepressants, but again the evidence was too small and uncertain to draw conclusions. Currently, it is uncertain whether continued or maintained pharmacotherapy (or both) with the reviewed antidepressant agents is a robust treatment for preventing relapse and recurrence in people with PDD due to moderate or high risk of bias as well as clinical heterogeneity in the analyzed studies; for all other comparisons, the body of evidence was too small to draw any final conclusions, although continued or maintained psychotherapy might be effective compared to no treatment. There is a need for more high quality trials of psychological interventions, and further studies should address health-related quality of life and adverse events more precisely, as well as assessing follow-up data.","Depressive disorders that persist for at least two years cause considerable problems; even after successful treatment, they frequently recur, and common treatments are antidepressant medicines and psychological treatments (talking therapies), or a combination of both, with long-term treatments intended to prevent the recurrence of depressive symptoms. People with persisting depression (longer than two years), friends, families, and carers, as well as general practitioners, psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, psychological therapists, and pharmacists, will be interested in this review. In adults with persistent depression who improved with acute (short-term) treatment, the review aimed to determine whether receiving continued antidepressant medicine, psychological treatment, or a combination of both is more effective in preventing recurrence of depression compared to placebo (a pretended treatment) or care as usual; whether receiving continued antidepressant medicine, psychological treatment, or a combination of both is equally accepted as receiving placebo or usual care; and whether one treatment is more effective or more accepted than another. We searched medical databases and other sources to find all relevant studies completed up to September 2018, and the studies had to compare antidepressant treatment, psychological treatment, or a combination of both, with each other, with placebo, or with care as usual for preventing recurrence of depression in adults diagnosed with persistent depression; we included 10 studies involving 840 participants. Five studies compared antidepressant medicine with placebo; one study compared psychological therapies versus attention placebo/non-specific control; one study compared psychotherapy with medication; three studies compared combined psychological and pharmacological therapies with pharmacological therapies alone; one study compared combined psychological and pharmacological therapies with psychotherapeutic therapies alone; and two studies compared two different antidepressants with each other. Overall, the included studies were at low-to-moderate risk of bias. According to GRADE, there was moderate quality evidence that participants taking medication treatment probably had less relapses/recurrences and may have lower dropouts than those taking placebo; the risk of depression returning in participants receiving a placebo (instead of antidepressant medicine) was 34%, whereas participants who remained on antidepressant medicines had a lower risk for recurrence of 13%, with continued treatment lasting between four months and two years. Antidepressants were as well accepted as placebo; however, as most of the included studies showed risk of bias and there were some inconsistent results between the different studies, it cannot be concluded with certainty whether continued or maintained pharmacotherapy (or both) is a convincing treatment for people with PDD. Additionally, as studies on the long-term effects of medication are lacking, recommendations on the necessary duration of medication treatment cannot be drawn. The benefits of psychological therapies or combined treatment remained unclear due to the small number of studies. This review cannot provide clear, certain evidence regarding whether continued antidepressant medication (compared to placebo tablet) reduces the risk of depression recurring in adults with persistent depression; however, only a few studies have been done, and further studies should especially address psychological and combined long-term treatments.",1116,Persistent depressive disorder; acute interventions; remission; continuation and maintenance therapy; psychotherapy,What might be the implications of the study's findings for the long-term management of persistent depressive disorder (PDD)?,What is the primary focus of the study?,Select all of the following that are fruits,Which treatments were compared in the study?,How are long-term treatments intended to benefit patients with persistent depression?,Continued antidepressant medication offers a definitive solution to prevent recurrence.; Psychotherapy could potentially be more effective but requires further research.; There is uncertainty regarding the efficacy of combined treatments due to limited data.,Psychotherapy could potentially be more effective but requires further research.; There is uncertainty regarding the efficacy of combined treatments due to limited data.,Assessing continuation and maintenance treatments for persistent depression; Investigating new antidepressant medications; Studying short-term interventions for depression,Assessing continuation and maintenance treatments for persistent depression,dog; blue; grape,grape,Antidepressant medications versus placebo; Psychological therapies versus attention placebo; Lifestyle interventions versus exercise,Antidepressant medications versus placebo; Psychological therapies versus attention placebo,Preventing recurrence of depressive symptoms; Eliminating depressive symptoms completely; Providing immediate relief from symptoms,Preventing recurrence of depressive symptoms
66497704c55b6a0ac500cb61,finetuned_6,Treatment with macrolide antibiotics (including azithromycin) for people with cystic fibrosis,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-limiting genetic condition, affecting over 90,000 people worldwide. CF affects several organs in the body, but airway damage has the most profound impact on quality of life (QoL) and survival. Causes of lower airway infection in people with CF are, most notably, Staphylococcus aureus in the early course of the disease and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at a later stage. Macrolide antibiotics, e.g. azithromycin and clarithromycin, are usually taken orally, have a broad spectrum of action against gram-positive (e.g. S aureus) and some gram-negative bacteria (e.g. Haemophilus influenzae), and may have a modifying role in diseases involving airway infection and inflammation such as CF. They are well-tolerated and relatively inexpensive, but widespread use has resulted in the emergence of resistant bacteria. To assess the potential effects of macrolide antibiotics on clinical status in terms of benefit and harm in people with CF. If benefit was demonstrated, we aimed to assess the optimal type, dose and duration of macrolide therapy. We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearching relevant journals, and abstract books of conference proceedings. We last searched the Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register on 2 November 2022. We last searched the trial registries WHO ICTRP and clinicaltrials.gov on 9 November 2022. We contacted investigators known to work in the field, previous authors and pharmaceutical companies manufacturing macrolide antibiotics for unpublished or follow-up data, where possible. We included randomised controlled trials of macrolide antibiotics in adults and children with CF. We compared them to: placebo; another class of antibiotic; another macrolide antibiotic; or the same macrolide antibiotic at a different dose or type of administration. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. We included 14 studies (1467 participants) lasting 28 days to 36 months. All the studies assessed azithromycin: 11 compared oral azithromycin to placebo (1167 participants); one compared a high dose to a low dose (47 participants); one compared nebulised to oral azithromycin (45 participants); and one looked at weekly versus daily dose (208 participants). Oral azithromycin versus placebo There is a slight improvement in forced expiratory volume (FEV1% predicted) in one second in the azithromycin group at up to six months compared to placebo (mean difference (MD) 3.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.74 to 6.19; high-certainty evidence), although there is probably no difference at three months, (MD 2.70%, 95% CI -0.12 to 5.52), or 12 months (MD -0.13, 95% CI -4.96 to 4.70). Participants in the azithromycin group are probably at a decreased risk of pulmonary exacerbation with a longer time to exacerbation (hazard ratio (HR) 0.61, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.75; moderate-certainty evidence). Mild side effects were common, but there was no difference between groups (moderate-certainty evidence). There is no difference in hospital admissions at six months (odds ratio (OR) 0.61, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.04; high-certainty evidence), or in new acquisition of P aeruginosa at 12 months (HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.55; moderate-certainty evidence). High-dose versus low-dose azithromycin We are uncertain whether there is any difference in FEV1% predicted at six months between the two groups (no data available) or in the rate of exacerbations per child per month (MD -0.05 (95% CI -0.20 to 0.10)); very low-certainty evidence for both outcomes. Only children were included in the study and the study did not report on any of our other clinically important outcomes. Nebulised azithromycin versus oral azithromycin We were unable to include any of the data into our analyses and have reported findings directly from the paper; we graded all evidence as being of very low certainty. The authors reported that there was a greater mean change in FEV1% predicted at one month in the nebulised azithromycin group (P < 0.001). We are uncertain whether there was a change in P aeruginosa count. Weekly azithromycin versus daily azithromycin There is probably a lower mean change in FEV1% predicted at six months in the weekly group compared to the daily group (MD -0.70, 95% CI -0.95 to -0.45) and probably also a longer period of time until first exacerbation in the weekly group (MD 17.30 days, 95% CI 4.32 days to 30.28 days). Gastrointestinal side effects are probably more common in the weekly group and there is likely no difference in admissions to hospital or QoL. We graded all evidence as moderate certainty. Azithromycin therapy is associated with a small but consistent improvement in respiratory function, a decreased risk of exacerbation and longer time to exacerbation at six months; but evidence for treatment efficacy beyond six months remains limited. Azithromycin appears to have a good safety profile (although a weekly dose was associated with more gastrointestinal side effects, which makes it less acceptable for long-term therapy), with a relatively minimal treatment burden for people with CF, and it is inexpensive. A wider concern may be the emergence of macrolide resistance reported in the most recent study which, combined with the lack of long-term data, means we do not feel that the current evidence is strong enough to support azithromycin therapy for all people with CF. Future research should report over longer time frames using validated tools and consistent reporting, to allow for easier synthesis of data. In particular, future trials should report important adverse events such as hearing impairment or liver disease. More data on the effects of azithromycin given in different ways and reporting on our primary outcomes would benefit decision-making on whether and how to give macrolide antibiotics. Finally, it is important to assess azithromycin therapy for people with CF who are established on the relatively new cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator therapies which correct the underlying molecular defect associated with CF (none of the trials included in the review are relevant to this population).","What are the effects of macrolide antibiotics in people with cystic fibrosis (CF) and infection of their airways? People with CF suffer from infections in their airways, often caused by the bug Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is resistant to nearly all antibiotics that can be swallowed (oral). Macrolide antibiotics, e.g. azithromycin and clarithromycin, have no direct killing effect on Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but they may reduce the activity of these bacteria. We wanted to discover whether the use of macrolide antibiotics (usually taken orally) affected the health of people with CF and whether these drugs have any side effects.
We searched for studies that looked at the effects of macrolide antibiotics in children and adults with CF and summarised the evidence. We found 14 studies, which put the total of 1467 children and adults into different treatment groups at random, which we included in this review. Eleven studies compared azithromycin to placebo, one compared two different doses of azithromycin (high versus low dose), one compared inhaled azithromycin to oral azithromycin, and one compared oral azithromycin once a week to once a day. We found that there was a slight improvement in lung function in people that were given azithromycin compared to a placebo at six months and also that the risk of a flare-up of infection was lower. The risk of side effects (such as vomiting, diarrhoea and headache) was similar in both groups, as was the chance of a new infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In terms of lung function and flare-up of infection, we were unsure whether a higher dose of azithromycin is better than a lower dose (but only one study in children examined dose), or whether inhaled azithromycin is better than oral azithromycin. Taking oral azithromycin once a week compared to every day probably leads to less of an improvement in lung function, but there is probably a longer time to a flare-up in the weekly group. We were unable to combine all the study results because they were measured in different ways and at different time points; future trials should address this issue. Also, now that many people with CF are being treated with the new modulator therapies (e.g. elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor), it is important to assess how macrolide antibiotics affect the health of these people. In the studies we found for this review, none of the people taking part were being treated with modulator therapies. We are able to report the results of the studies that compared azithromycin to placebo with certainty as the studies were well conducted and included a larger number of participants. The evidence from the studies comparing high and low doses or nebulised and oral azithromycin was much less certain because the studies were small and there was risk of bias in the way they were carried out. We were moderately certain of the results of the study comparing weekly azithromycin to daily azithromycin.",1076,Cystic fibrosis; Staphylococcus aureus; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; macrolide antibiotics; azithromycin; clarithromycin; forced expiratory volume; pulmonary exacerbation; cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; CFTR modulator therapies,What is the primary health issue that macrolide antibiotics aim to address in people with cystic fibrosis?,"Which bacterial infection is particularly problematic for people with cystic fibrosis, according to the summary?",Select all of the following that are colors,What is one known effect of macrolide antibiotics on lung function in people with cystic fibrosis?,"According to the study, what was a finding regarding the risk of infection flare-up when using azithromycin?",Infections in their airways; Heart disease; Diabetes,Infections in their airways,Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Escherichia coli; Streptococcus pneumoniae,Pseudomonas aeruginosa,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Slight improvement at six months; Deterioration at six months; No effect at six months,Slight improvement at six months,The risk was lower compared to placebo; The risk was higher compared to placebo; The risk was unchanged compared to placebo,The risk was lower compared to placebo
66497704c55b6a0ac500cb61,finetuned_6,Collaborative care for people with depression and anxiety,"Common mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety, are estimated to affect up to 15% of the UK population at any one time, and health care systems worldwide need to implement interventions to reduce the impact and burden of these conditions; collaborative care is a complex intervention based on chronic disease management models that may be effective in the management of these common mental health problems. To assess the effectiveness of collaborative care for patients with depression or anxiety, we searched databases to February 2012, including The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group (CCDAN) trials registers (CCDANCTR-References and CCDANCTR-Studies) which include relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from MEDLINE (1950 to present), EMBASE (1974 to present), PsycINFO (1967 to present) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, all years), as well as the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal (ICTRP), ClinicalTrials.gov, and CINAHL (to November 2010 only), and we screened the reference lists of reports of all included studies and published systematic reviews for reports of additional studies. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of collaborative care for participants of all ages with depression or anxiety were included; two independent researchers extracted data using a standardised data extraction sheet, made 'Risk of bias' assessments using criteria from The Cochrane Collaboration, combined continuous measures of outcome using standardised mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), combined dichotomous measures using risk ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs, and conducted sensitivity analyses to test robustness. We included seventy-nine RCTs (including 90 relevant comparisons) involving 24,308 participants in the review, and studies varied in terms of risk of bias. The results of primary analyses demonstrated significantly greater improvement in depression outcomes for adults with depression treated with the collaborative care model in the short-term (SMD -0.34, 95% CI -0.41 to -0.27; RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.43), medium-term (SMD -0.28, 95% CI -0.41 to -0.15; RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.48), and long-term (SMD -0.35, 95% CI -0.46 to -0.24; RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.41); however, these significant benefits were not demonstrated into the very long-term (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.27). The results also demonstrated significantly greater improvement in anxiety outcomes for adults with anxiety treated with the collaborative care model in the short-term (SMD -0.30, 95% CI -0.44 to -0.17; RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.87), medium-term (SMD -0.33, 95% CI -0.47 to -0.19; RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.69), and long-term (SMD -0.20, 95% CI -0.34 to -0.06; RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.42); no comparisons examined the effects of the intervention on anxiety outcomes in the very long-term. There was evidence of benefit in secondary outcomes including medication use, mental health quality of life, and patient satisfaction, although there was less evidence of benefit in physical quality of life. Collaborative care is associated with significant improvement in depression and anxiety outcomes compared with usual care, and represents a useful addition to clinical pathways for adult patients with depression and anxiety.","Many people suffer from depression and anxiety, and these problems can make people feel sad, scared and even suicidal, and can affect their work, their relationships and their quality of life; depression and anxiety can occur because of personal, financial, social or health problems. Collaborative care is an innovative way of treating depression and anxiety and involves a number of health professionals working with a patient to help them overcome their problems; it often involves a medical doctor, a case manager (with training in depression and anxiety), and a mental health specialist such as a psychiatrist, with the case manager having regular contact with the person and organising care together with the medical doctor and specialist, and offering help with medication or access to a talking therapy to help the patient get better. Collaborative care has been tested with patients in a number of countries and health care systems, but it is not clear whether it should be recommended for people with depression or anxiety. In this review we found 79 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (90 comparisons) including 24,308 patients worldwide, comparing collaborative care with routine care or alternative treatments (such as consultation-liaison) for depression and anxiety; there were problems with the methods in some of the studies, for example, the methods used to allocate patients to collaborative care or routine care were not always free from bias, and many patients did not complete follow-up or provide information about their outcomes. Most of the studies focused on depression and the evidence suggests that collaborative care is better than routine care in improving depression for up to two years; a smaller number of studies examined the effect of collaborative care on anxiety and the evidence suggests that collaborative care is also better than usual care in improving anxiety for up to two years. Collaborative care increases the number of patients using medication in line with current guidance, and can improve mental health related quality of life, and patients with depression and anxiety treated with collaborative care are also more satisfied with their treatment.",1114,collaborative care; chronic disease management models; mental health problems; depression outcomes; anxiety outcomes; medication use; mental health quality of life; patient satisfaction; physical quality of life; clinical pathways,Why is there uncertainty about recommending collaborative care for depression and anxiety?,In what ways can collaborative care enhance the treatment of depression and anxiety?,Select the items that are animals,What are the common issues targeted by collaborative care?,How does collaborative care compare with routine care in managing depression?,The impact on very long-term outcomes is unclear.; The intervention is clearly less effective than routine care.; The number of health professionals involved makes it impractical.,The impact on very long-term outcomes is unclear.,By increasing the use of medication in line with guidelines.; By improving long-term physical quality of life.; By reducing the need for professional involvement.,By increasing the use of medication in line with guidelines.,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,Depression and anxiety; Cardiovascular diseases; Infectious diseases,Depression and anxiety,Collaborative care is better at improving depression outcomes; Routine care is more effective; Both have similar effects,Collaborative care is better at improving depression outcomes
628eada3a9c9e0776884f27d,static_1,Are anti-blood clotting drugs beneficial for people with chronic kidney disease?,"Antiplatelet agents are widely used to prevent cardiovascular events. The risks and benefits of antiplatelet agents may be different in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) for whom occlusive atherosclerotic events are less prevalent, and bleeding hazards might be increased. This is an update of a review first published in 2013. To evaluate the benefits and harms of antiplatelet agents in people with any form of CKD, including those with CKD not receiving renal replacement therapy, patients receiving any form of dialysis, and kidney transplant recipients. We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 13 July 2021 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. We selected randomised controlled trials of any antiplatelet agents versus placebo or no treatment, or direct head-to-head antiplatelet agent studies in people with CKD. Studies were included if they enrolled participants with CKD, or included people in broader at-risk populations in which data for subgroups with CKD could be disaggregated. Four authors independently extracted data from primary study reports and any available supplementary information for study population, interventions, outcomes, and risks of bias. Risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated from numbers of events and numbers of participants at risk which were extracted from each included study. The reported RRs were extracted where crude event rates were not provided. Data were pooled using the random-effects model. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. We included 113 studies, enrolling 51,959 participants; 90 studies (40,597 CKD participants) compared an antiplatelet agent with placebo or no treatment, and 29 studies (11,805 CKD participants) directly compared one antiplatelet agent with another. Fifty-six new studies were added to this 2021 update. Seven studies originally excluded from the 2013 review were included, although they had a follow-up lower than two months. Random sequence generation and allocation concealment were at low risk of bias in 16 and 22 studies, respectively. Sixty-four studies reported low-risk methods for blinding of participants and investigators; outcome assessment was blinded in 41 studies. Forty-one studies were at low risk of attrition bias, 50 studies were at low risk of selective reporting bias, and 57 studies were at low risk of other potential sources of bias. Compared to placebo or no treatment, antiplatelet agents probably reduces myocardial infarction (18 studies, 15,289 participants: RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.99, IÃÆÃÆÃâÃÂ¯ÃÆÃâÃâÃÂ¿ÃÆÃâÃâÃÂ½ = 0%; moderate certainty). Antiplatelet agents has uncertain effects on fatal or nonfatal stroke (12 studies, 10.382 participants: RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.59, I2 = 37%; very low certainty) and may have little or no effect on death from any cause (35 studies, 18,241 participants: RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.06, I2 = 14%; low certainty). Antiplatelet therapy probably increases major bleeding in people with CKD and those treated with haemodialysis (HD) (29 studies, 16,194 participants: RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.65, I2 = 12%; moderate certainty). In addition, antiplatelet therapy may increase minor bleeding in people with CKD and those treated with HD (21 studies, 13,218 participants: RR 1.55, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.90, I2= 58%; low certainty). Antiplatelet treatment may reduce early dialysis vascular access thrombosis (8 studies, 1525 participants: RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.70; low certainty). Antiplatelet agents may reduce doubling of serum creatinine in CKD (3 studies, 217 participants: RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.86, I2 = 8%; low certainty). The treatment effects of antiplatelet agents on stroke, cardiovascular death, kidney failure, kidney transplant graft loss, transplant rejection, creatinine clearance, proteinuria, dialysis access failure, loss of primary unassisted patency, failure to attain suitability for dialysis, need of intervention and cardiovascular hospitalisation were uncertain. Limited data were available for direct head-to-head comparisons of antiplatelet drugs, including prasugrel, ticagrelor, different doses of clopidogrel, abciximab, defibrotide, sarpogrelate and beraprost. Antiplatelet agents probably reduced myocardial infarction and increased major bleeding, but do not appear to reduce all-cause and cardiovascular death among people with CKD and those treated with dialysis. The treatment effects of antiplatelet agents compared with each other are uncertain.","People with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have an increased risk of heart disease that can block the blood supply to the heart or brain causing a heart attack or stroke. Drugs that prevent blood clots from forming (antiplatelet agents) can prevent deaths caused by clots in arteries in the general adult population. However, there may be fewer benefits for people who have CKD, because blood clots in arteries is a less common cause of death or reason to be admitted to hospital compared with heart failure or sudden death in these people. People with CKD also have an increased tendency for bleeding due to changes in how the blood clots, so antiplatelet agents may therefore be more hazardous when CKD is present. This updated review evaluated the benefits and harms of antiplatelet agents to prevent cardiovascular disease and death, and the impact on dialysis vascular access (fistula or graft) function in people who have CKD. We identified 90 studies comparing antiplatelet agents with placebo or no treatment and 29 studies directly comparing one antiplatelet agent with another. Antiplatelet agents probably prevent heart attacks, but do not clearly reduce death or stroke. Treatment with these agents may increase the risk of major and minor bleeding. Clotting of dialysis access was prevented with antiplatelet agents. The benefits of antiplatelet agents for people with CKD is probably limited to the prevention of a heart attack; the treatment does not appear to prevent stroke or death and probably incurs excess serious bleeding that may require hospital admission or transfusion.",1091,Antiplatelet agents; renal replacement therapy; dialysis; myocardial infarction; fatal or nonfatal stroke; major bleeding; dialysis vascular access thrombosis; serum creatinine; cardiovascular death; transplant graft loss,What is one potential benefit of antiplatelet agents for people with CKD?,Which outcome is not significantly reduced by antiplatelet agents in CKD patients?,Select all of the following that are colors,Identify a potential risk associated with antiplatelet use in CKD patients.,Describe the impact of antiplatelet agents on the risk of heart attack in CKD patients.,Preventing heart attacks; Reducing all-cause mortality; Decreasing major bleeding,Preventing heart attacks,Stroke; Heart attack; Dialysis access clotting,Stroke,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Major bleeding; Increased kidney function; Decreased hospitalization,Major bleeding,They probably prevent heart attacks.; They have no effect on heart attacks.; They increase the risk of heart attacks.,They probably prevent heart attacks.
628eada3a9c9e0776884f27d,static_2,What are the benefits and harms of remote ischaemic conditioning (briefly restricting then restoring blood flow) for preventing and treating stroke?,"Remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) has been developed as a neuroprotective strategy to prevent and treat ischaemic stroke. It usually involves restricting blood flow to limbs and then releasing the ischaemic blood to promote a neuroprotective effect. Preclinical studies have suggested that RIC may have beneficial effects in ischaemic stroke patients and those at risk of ischaemic stroke. However, existing evidence is insufficient to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of RIC in preventing and treating ischaemic stroke. To evaluate the benefits and harms of remote ischaemic conditioning in preventing and treating ischaemic stroke compared to sham or standard treatments. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, three Chinese databases, five trials registers, and conference proceedings, together with reference checking and citation searching. The latest search date was 11 March 2025. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing RIC with sham RIC or medical management in people with ischaemic stroke or at risk of ischaemic stroke. Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed trial quality and risk of bias, and extracted data. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence. We included seven trials, involving 735 participants, in this review. We analysed the effects of RIC on preventing and treating ischaemic stroke respectively. We evaluated risk of bias and judged it to be low for generation of allocation sequence in six studies and unclear in one study; unclear for allocation concealment in four studies and low in three studies; high for incomplete outcome data (attrition bias) in five studies and low in two studies; high for blinding in three studies and low in four studies; low for selective reporting; and high for other sources of bias in six studies and low in one study. We included three trials (involving 371 participants) in the analysis of the effects of RIC on ischaemic stroke prevention. In people with symptomatic intracerebral artery stenosis, recurrent stroke was significantly reduced by RIC (risk ratio (RR) 0.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12 to 0.83; 2 trials, 182 participants, low-quality evidence). In people with carotid stenosis undergoing carotid stenting, there was no significant difference in the incidence of ischaemic stroke between participants treated with RIC and non-RIC (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.03; 1 trial, 189 participants, low-quality evidence); however the stroke severity (assessed by infarct volume) was significantly lower in participants treated with RIC (mean difference (MD) -0.17 mL, 95% CI -0.23 to -0.11; 1 trial, 189 participants, low-quality evidence). Adverse events associated with RIC were significantly higher in participants treated with RIC (RR 10.91; 95% CI 2.01 to 59.28; 3 trials, 371 participants, low-quality evidence), but no severe adverse event was attributable to RIC treatment. No participants experienced death or cardiovascular events during the period of the studies; and no trial reported haemorrhagic stroke or improvement in neurological, phycological or cognitive impairment. We included four trials (involving 364 participants) in the analysis of the effects of RIC on ischaemic stroke treatment. In acute ischaemic stroke, for people receiving intravenous thrombolysis, the rate of death or dependency was significantly increased by RIC treatment compared with non-RIC treatment (RR 2.34; 95% 1.19 to 4.61; 1 trial, 285 participants, low-quality evidence). In people with acute ischaemic stroke, there was no significant difference between RIC and non-RIC for reducing stroke severity as assessed by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score and the final infarct volume (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.24 mL, 95% CI -1.02 to 0.54; 2 trials, 175 participants, very low quality evidence). There was no significant difference between RIC and non-RIC for improving the psychological impairment (SMD -0.37 points, 95% CI -1.15 to 0.41; 1 trial, 26 participants, very low quality evidence) and the cognitive impairment (SMD -0.26 points; 95% CI -0.72 to 0.21; 3 trials, 79 participants, low-quality evidence) in people with acute ischaemic stroke and cerebral small vessel disease. No trial reported ischaemic stroke, recurrent ischaemic stroke, improvement in neurological impairment, hemorrhagic stroke, cardiovascular events, and RIC associated adverse events. There is moderate-certainty evidence that RIC compared to non-RIC probably reduces recurrence of ischaemic stroke slightly, and low-certainty evidence that RIC may result in a slight increase in excellent functional outcome (mRS 0 to 1). Evidence for improvement in NIHSS scores is very uncertain due to risk of bias and imprecision. RIC demonstrated an acceptable harm profile with no increase in intracerebral haemorrhage or mortality; however, treatment-related adverse events were more common. The certainty of evidence was limited by high risk of bias for blinding in most studies, incomplete outcome data in some studies, and imprecision in several outcomes. However, the generalisability of these findings may be limited because 79.3% of participants were from China, highlighting the need for further studies in diverse populations to confirm the results. The optimal timing, duration, and method of RIC administration require further investigation through large, high-quality randomised trials with standardised protocols to establish definitive evidence for clinical practice. This updated analysis includes 16 new RCTs, and these findings highlight the need for ongoing research and careful consideration of study design and methodology in future investigations.","Ischaemic stroke is the most common type of stroke. It occurs when a blood clot blocks an artery that supplies blood to the brain. This blockage cuts off the supply of oxygen and nutrients to a part of the brain. Without this blood supply, brain cells in that area are damaged and begin to die. Remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) involves briefly and repeatedly restricting and then restoring blood flow in a limb (an arm or leg) with a blood pressure cuff. The goal is to ""condition"" the limb and trigger the body's natural defences to protect other organs. Studies have found that for people who have had a stroke and are receiving standard medical care, adding RIC can reduce the amount of brain tissue damaged by the stroke, improve recovery of everyday functions, help prevent another stroke from happening, and reduce problems with memory and thinking.
We wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of RIC in people who have had an ischaemic stroke and are undergoing various treatments, including standard medical therapy, intravenous thrombolysis (a clot-dissolving treatment), or mechanical thrombectomy (a procedure to remove clots). Specifically, we wanted to know if RIC was better than sham or standard treatment for improving:
- the risk of dying;
- the risk of having another stroke;
- the likelihood of an excellent recovery (a score on the Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) of 0 to 1);
- the likelihood of being able to live independently (mRS score of 0 to 2);
- the risk of a brain bleed;
- brain function issues;
- the risk of major heart problems.
We also wanted to know if RIC has unwanted effects.
We searched for studies that compared the benefits and harms of remote ischaemic conditioning in people with ischaemic stroke. We then compared and summarised the study results and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and sample sizes.
We found 21 studies with 7687 people. The studies took place in China, Denmark, France, the UK, and Romania, and were published between 2012 and 2025.
Sixteen studies including 6828 participants suggested that RIC compared to sham or no treatment probably leads to a slight reduction in the risk of having another stroke. About half the studies measured participants' level of independence using the mRS and measured change in brain function issues using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). RIC might lead to a slight increase in the number of people achieving an excellent recovery, but may have little or no effect on the number of people being able to live independently. In addition, RIC might result in a slight improvement in brain function issues, but the evidence is very uncertain. There may be little or no difference between RIC and sham or standard treatment in the risk of a brain bleed and major heart problems, and RIC probably does not increase the risk of death. However, RIC may have unwanted effects such as arm pain, redness, or swelling.
We also identified 21 ongoing studies that we plan to add to the next version of our review.
Our confidence in the evidence is moderate to very low for several reasons. Most studies had few participants, and more than half of studies were done in China, which means the results of our review may not apply to people in other parts of the world. Some studies included people who received clot-dissolving treatment (thrombolysis) and people who did not, and we could not separate the results for these two groups. This mix of patients may have affected our overall analysis. Finally, we did not separate the results in our analysis based on the type of comparison group used (sham or standard treatment). This means it is difficult to know if the treatment effect we found was influenced by the type of comparison.",1069,Ischaemic stroke; Remote ischaemic conditioning; Neuroprotective effect; Symptomatic intracerebral artery stenosis; Carotid stenosis; Intravenous thrombolysis; Infarct volume; National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale; Carotid stenting,What is the primary goal of remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) mentioned in the summary?,What effects of RIC on brain function issues were summarized?,Select the items that are animals,How does RIC compare to sham or standard treatment in terms of stroke recurrence risk?,What was evaluated alongside the benefits of RIC in the summary?,To dissolve existing blood clots in the brain.; To trigger the body's natural defenses to protect other organs.; To permanently restrict blood flow to limbs.,To trigger the body's natural defenses to protect other organs.,RIC might result in a slight improvement in brain function issues.; RIC causes significant decline in cognitive function.; RIC has no impact on brain function issues.,RIC might result in a slight improvement in brain function issues.,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,RIC probably leads to a slight reduction in the risk of having another stroke.; RIC significantly increases the risk of recurrent stroke.; RIC has no effect on stroke recurrence risk.,RIC probably leads to a slight reduction in the risk of having another stroke.,The harms of RIC were also evaluated.; Only the economic cost of RIC was evaluated.; RIC's compatibility with other conditions was evaluated.,The harms of RIC were also evaluated.
628eada3a9c9e0776884f27d,static_2,Immunosuppressive treatment for adults with idiopathic membranous nephropathy,"Primary membranous nephropathy (PMN) is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults, and without treatment about one-third of patients experience spontaneous remission, one-third have persistent proteinuria, and one-third progress to end?stage kidney disease (ESKD) within 10 years. Immunosuppressive therapy is used to protect kidney function in patients who do not improve with supportive treatment or who present with severe nephrotic syndrome, but the relative safety and effectiveness of different treatments have been unclear. This updated review included 65 studies involving 3807 adults with PMN and found that, compared with placebo or no immunosuppression, immunosuppressive therapy probably reduces the risk of progressing to ESKD, increases the likelihood of complete or partial remission, and lowers the number of people whose serum creatinine doubles, though it probably makes little or no difference to mortality. However, immunosuppressive therapy may increase relapse after remission and may increase temporary or permanent treatment discontinuation due to adverse effects, while its effects on infection and malignancy remain uncertain. Oral alkylating agents with or without steroids may reduce the risk of ESKD and may increase remission rates but also may lead to more treatment?related adverse events, and their effects on relapse, creatinine progression, infection, and malignancy remain uncertain. Evidence for calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus or cyclosporine), with or without steroids, was very uncertain, including whether they affect remission, relapse, ESKD, or adverse events. When calcineurin inhibitors were compared to alkylating agents, they appeared similarly effective for achieving remission but may result in higher relapse rates, though the overall certainty of evidence was low to moderate. Other treatments such as azathioprine, mizoribine, adrenocorticotropic hormone, traditional Chinese medicines, and rituximab had insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions. Overall, immunosuppressive therapy appears more effective than non-immunosuppressive management for inducing remission and reducing progression to ESKD, but this must be weighed against higher risks of adverse effects, and the evidence base remains limited by small sample sizes, high risk of bias, and inadequate follow-up. Alkylating agents combined with corticosteroids show both short- and long-term benefits but also higher toxicity, calcineurin inhibitors show similar efficacy but uncertain long-term safety, and biologics such as rituximab require further large, high-quality trials to determine their role.","Primary membranous nephropathy (PMN) is an autoimmune disease, where the body's immune system attacks the kidneys. The term ""primary"" is used to describe membranous nephropathy that is not caused by another disease in the body. PMN is a leading cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults. Nephrotic syndrome is a condition, where the membrane of the kidney is damaged and becomes permeable for proteins. Primary membranous nephropathy is diagnosed through findings in a kidney biopsy and the presence of nephrotic syndrome. PMN is not harmful in about one-third of patients, who will have a spontaneous ""complete remission"", which means that the disease will resolve by itself. However, about another one third will experience spontaneous remission but will have some protein in the urine that continues with normal kidney function. These patients usually only require supportive treatments that do not interact with the immune system. Without treatment, about 15% to 50% of patients progress to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) within 10 years. In some patients, PMN can be severe or continues to get worse even after using 6 months of supportive treatments. In these patients, extra treatment that dampens the activity of the immune system may be used to reduce damage to the kidney. It is not clear which of these treatment(s) is the most helpful and what side effects can occur. Therefore, the duration and intensity of immunosuppressive treatment need to be balanced against possible side effects. There are different classes of drugs used in immunosuppressive therapy. These drugs may or may not be combined with corticosteroids (drugs based on the body's stress response hormone cortisol). We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant specialised register up to 1 April 2021. We have combined studies to compare different treatment regimens with immunosuppressive therapy to assess which treatments help to treat patients with PMN and nephrotic syndrome with the least side effects. This review identified sixty-five studies with 3807 patients. Different types of immunosuppressive treatment include alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil), calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus and cyclosporine), antimetabolites (mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine), biologicals (e.g. rituximab) and adrenocorticotropic hormone. These drugs may or may not be combined with corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone), which also suppresses the immune system. After combining the results of available studies together, we found that compared with no treatment, supportive treatment or steroids alone, the use of immunosuppressive treatment probably reduced the number of patients who progressed to ESKD by about 40% and increased the number of patients that achieved complete remission. However, immunosuppressive treatment may lead to more adverse events, which can cause treatment to be stopped or lead to the patients needing to go to hospital. The different drugs that can be used in the immunosuppressive treatment were also examined in our review. We found that alkylating agents probably increases complete remission but may lead to more adverse events. We are uncertain whether alkylating agents increase infection or cancer. Based on the currently available evidence, the effectiveness of using calcineurin inhibitors is still unclear, but there is low certainty of the evidence, that CNI may lead to similar remission rates compared to alkylating agents.
Furthermore, other treatment options such as mycophenolate mofetil, adrenocorticotropic hormone, rituximab and others have only been examined in a few studies. There is not enough data to draw final conclusions on the use of these treatments in adults with PMN and nephrotic syndrome. The treatment of patients with PMN and nephrotic syndrome with immunosuppressive therapy compared to no treatment or supportive therapy alone probably protects the kidney but may increase side effects. A combination of immunosuppressive therapy with steroids may decrease disease activity and the use of alkylating agent combined with steroids probably has the short-term and long-term benefits of limiting damage to the kidney. Other therapies such as calcineurin inhibitors, mycophenolate mofetil, rituximab and adrenocorticotropic hormone have less certainty regarding their safety and effectiveness from these studies.",1086,Primary membranous nephropathy; nephrotic syndrome; immunosuppressive therapy; end-stage kidney disease; proteinuria; spontaneous remission; serum creatinine; alkylating agents; calcineurin inhibitors; rituximab,What is primary membranous nephropathy (PMN) primarily characterized by?,"In the context of PMN, what does spontaneous remission imply?",Select all of the following that are fruits,Which type of PMN patients might require immunosuppressive therapy?,What is a primary goal of immunosuppressive therapy in PMN treatment?,An autoimmune attack on the kidneys; A viral infection affecting the kidneys; A genetic disorder affecting the kidneys,An autoimmune attack on the kidneys,The disease resolves by itself; Immediate need for immunosuppressive therapy; Progression to end-stage kidney disease,The disease resolves by itself,dog; blue; grape,grape,Patients with spontaneous complete remission; Patients with severe or worsening PMN; All patients with nephrotic syndrome,Patients with severe or worsening PMN,To reduce the progression to end-stage kidney disease; To increase proteinuria; To eliminate the need for biopsy,To reduce the progression to end-stage kidney disease
628eada3a9c9e0776884f27d,interactive_3,What are the benefits and risks of using steroids for treating nephrotic syndrome in children?,"In nephrotic syndrome, protein leaks from the blood into the urine through the glomeruli, resulting in hypoproteinaemia and generalised oedema. While most children with nephrotic syndrome respond to corticosteroids, 80% experience a relapsing course. Corticosteroids have reduced the death rate to around 3%; however, corticosteroids have well-recognised potentially serious adverse events such as obesity, poor growth, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, cataracts, glaucoma and behavioural disturbances. This is an update of a review first published in 2000 and updated in 2002, 2005, 2007, 2015 and 2020. The aim of this review was to assess the benefits and harms of different corticosteroid regimens in children with steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SSNS). The benefits and harms of therapy were studied in two groups of children: 1) children in their initial episode of SSNS and 2) children who experience a relapsing course of SSNS. We contacted the Information Specialist and searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 9 July 2024 using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) performed in children (one to 18 years) during their initial or subsequent episode of SSNS, comparing different durations, total doses or other dose strategies using any corticosteroid agent. Summary estimates of effects were obtained using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. In this 2024 update, we included five new studies, resulting in 54 studies randomising 4670 children. Risk of bias methodology was often poorly performed, with only 31 studies and 28 studies respectively assessed to be at low risk for random sequence generation and allocation concealment. Ten studies were at low risk of performance bias (blinding of participants and personnel), and 12 studies were at low risk of detection bias (blinding of outcome assessment); nine of these studies were placebo-controlled RCTs. Twenty-seven studies (fewer than 50%) were at low risk for attrition bias, and 26 studies were at low risk for reporting bias (selective outcome reporting). In studies at low risk of selection bias evaluating children in their initial episode of SSNS, there is little or no difference in the number of children with frequent relapses when comparing two months of prednisone with three months or more (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.10; 755 children, 5 studies; I2= 0%; high certainty evidence) or when comparing three months with five to seven months of therapy (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.33; 376 children, 3 studies; I2= 35%; high certainty evidence). In analyses of studies at low risk of selection bias, there is little or no difference in the number of children with any relapse by 12 to 24 months when comparing two months of prednisone with three months or more (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.06; 808 children; 6 studies; I2= 47%) or when comparing three months with five to seven months of therapy (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.11; 377 children, 3 studies; I2= 53%). Little or no difference was noted in adverse events between the different treatment durations. Amongst children with relapsing SSNS, four small studies (177 children) utilising lower doses of prednisone compared with standard regimens found little or no differences between groups in the numbers with relapse (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.20; I2= 0%). A fifth study (117 children) reported little or no difference between two weeks and four weeks of alternate-day prednisone after remission with daily prednisone. A recent large, well-designed study with 271 children found that administering daily prednisone compared with alternate-day prednisone or no prednisone during viral infection did not reduce the risk of relapse. In contrast, four previous small studies in children with frequently relapsing disease had reported that daily prednisone during viral infections compared with alternate-day prednisone or no treatment reduced the risk of relapse. There are four well-designed studies randomising 823 children, which have demonstrated that there is no benefit of prolonging prednisone therapy beyond two to three months in the first episode of SSNS. Small studies in children with relapsing disease have identified no differences in efficacy using lower induction doses or shorter durations of prednisone therapy. Large, well-designed studies are required to confirm these findings. While previous small studies had suggested that changing from alternate-day to daily prednisone therapy at the onset of infection reduced the likelihood of relapse, a much larger and well-designed study found no reduction in the number relapsing when administering daily prednisone at the onset of infection.","Nephrotic syndrome is a condition in which the kidneys leak protein from the blood into the urine, and if left untreated, children can develop serious infections. In most children, this protein leak stops with steroid treatment because steroids are strong anti-inflammatory medicines, but they can also cause significant side effects such as depression, anxiety, high blood pressure, cataracts, increased infection risk, weight gain, and slowed growth. Children may also experience repeated episodes of nephrotic syndrome, often triggered by viral infections. We wanted to determine the best treatment options for children with nephrotic syndrome to stop protein leakage while avoiding harmful steroid side effects. We searched for all studies that compared the benefits and risks of different steroid regimens in children experiencing nephrotic syndrome for the first time or in those with frequent repeat episodes. We identified 54 studies involving 4670 children from around the world, many from South Asia. Twenty-three studies compared shorter courses of prednisone lasting two to three months with longer courses lasting three to seven months in children experiencing their first episode. The remaining studies looked at children with frequent relapses. We found that longer courses of prednisone (three to seven months) did not meaningfully reduce the chance of a child experiencing another episode or becoming someone who has frequent repeat episodes, compared with shorter two- to three-month courses. The side effects appeared similar between shorter and longer treatments, although many studies did not report this information clearly. Overall, the evidence shows that children experiencing nephrotic syndrome for the first time only need two to three months of prednisone because extending treatment does not lower the risk of relapses. However, we are less confident regarding side effects since many studies did not provide enough usable information.",1085,nephrotic syndrome; hypoproteinaemia; oedema; corticosteroids; steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome; prednisone; glomeruli; alternate-day prednisone; frequently relapsing; remission,Name a motivation for the study according to the plain-language summary.,State a key finding regarding the duration of prednisone treatment.,Select the items that are animals,Explain the goal of reviewing different steroid regimens.,Paraphrase the study's conclusion on treatment duration.,To find the most effective steroid regimens; To determine if steroid therapy is outdated; To evaluate new surgical techniques,To find the most effective steroid regimens,Longer courses reduce the chance of episodes; Shorter courses are as effective as longer courses; Only intravenous doses are effective,Shorter courses are as effective as longer courses,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,To balance efficacy and side effects; To eliminate steroid usage entirely; To improve patient dietary plans,To balance efficacy and side effects,Extending treatment beyond two to three months is unnecessary; Seven-month treatments are significantly better; All patients benefit most from indefinite treatment,Extending treatment beyond two to three months is unnecessary
628eada3a9c9e0776884f27d,interactive_4,Mediterranean-style diet for the prevention of cardiovascular disease,"The Seven Countries study in the 1960s showed that populations in the Mediterranean region experienced lower coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality probably as a result of different dietary patterns. Later observational studies have confirmed the benefits of adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors but clinical trial evidence is more limited.
To determine the effectiveness of a Mediterranean-style diet for the primary and secondary prevention of CVD.
We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 9); MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 25 September 2018); Embase (Ovid, 1980 to 2018 week 39); Web of Science Core Collection (Thomson Reuters, 1900 to 26 September 2018); DARE Issue 2 of 4, 2015 (Cochrane Library); HTA Issue 4 of 4, 2016 (Cochrane Library); NHS EED Issue 2 of 4, 2015 (Cochrane Library). We searched trial registers and applied no language restrictions.
We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in healthy adults and adults at high risk of CVD (primary prevention) and those with established CVD (secondary prevention). Both of the following key components were required to reach our definition of a Mediterranean-style diet: high monounsaturated/saturated fat ratio (use of olive oil as main cooking ingredient and/or consumption of other traditional foods high in monounsaturated fats such as tree nuts) and a high intake of plant-based foods, including fruits, vegetables and legumes. Additional components included: low to moderate red wine consumption; high consumption of whole grains and cereals; low consumption of meat and meat products and increased consumption of fish; moderate consumption of milk and dairy products. The intervention could be dietary advice, provision of relevant foods, or both. The comparison group received either no intervention, minimal intervention, usual care or another dietary intervention. Outcomes included clinical events and CVD risk factors. We included only studies with follow-up periods of three months or more defined as the intervention period plus post intervention follow-up.
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We conducted four main comparisons: 1. Mediterranean dietary intervention versus no intervention or minimal intervention for primary prevention; 2. Mediterranean dietary intervention versus another dietary intervention for primary prevention; 3. Mediterranean dietary intervention versus usual care for secondary prevention; 4. Mediterranean dietary intervention versus another dietary intervention for secondary prevention.
In this substantive review update, 30 RCTs (49 papers) (12,461 participants randomised) and seven ongoing trials met our inclusion criteria. The majority of trials contributed to primary prevention: comparisons 1 (nine trials) and 2 (13 trials). Secondary prevention trials were included for comparison 3 (two trials) and comparison 4 (four trials plus an additional two trials that were excluded from the main analyses due to published concerns regarding the reliability of the data). Two trials reported on adverse events where these were absent or minor (low- to moderate-quality evidence). No trials reported on costs or health-related quality of life. Primary prevention The included studies for comparison 1 did not report on clinical endpoints (CVD mortality, total mortality or non-fatal endpoints such as myocardial infarction or stroke). The PREDIMED trial (included in comparison 2) was retracted and re-analysed following concerns regarding randomisation at two of 11 sites. Low-quality evidence shows little or no effect of the PREDIMED (7747 randomised) intervention (advice to follow a Mediterranean diet plus supplemental extra-virgin olive oil or tree nuts) compared to a low-fat diet on CVD mortality (hazard ratio (HR) 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50 to 1.32) or total mortality (HR 1.0, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.24) over 4.8 years. There was, however, a reduction in the number of strokes with the PREDIMED intervention (HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.80), a decrease from 24/1000 to 14/1000 (95% CI 11 to 19), moderate-quality evidence). For CVD risk factors for comparison 1 there was low-quality evidence for a possible small reduction in total cholesterol (-0.16 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.32 to 0.00) and moderate-quality evidence for a reduction in systolic (-2.99 mmHg (95% CI -3.45 to -2.53) and diastolic blood pressure (-2.0 mmHg, 95% CI -2.29 to -1.71), with low or very low-quality evidence of little or no effect on LDL or HDL cholesterol or triglycerides. For comparison 2 there was moderate-quality evidence of a possible small reduction in LDL cholesterol (-0.15 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.27 to -0.02) and triglycerides (-0.09 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.16 to -0.01) with moderate or low-quality evidence of little or no effect on total or HDL cholesterol or blood pressure. Secondary prevention For secondary prevention, the Lyon Diet Heart Study (comparison 3) examined the effect of advice to follow a Mediterranean diet and supplemental canola margarine compared to usual care in 605 CHD patients over 46 months and there was low-quality evidence of a reduction in adjusted estimates for CVD mortality (HR 0.35, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.82) and total mortality (HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.92) with the intervention. Only one small trial (101 participants) provided unadjusted estimates for composite clinical endpoints for comparison 4 (very low-quality evidence of uncertain effect). For comparison 3 there was low-quality evidence of little or no effect of a Mediterranean-style diet on lipid levels and very low-quality evidence for blood pressure. Similarly, for comparison 4 where only two trials contributed to the analyses there was low or very low-quality evidence of little or no effect of the intervention on lipid levels or blood pressure.
Despite the relatively large number of studies included in this review, there is still some uncertainty regarding the effects of a Mediterranean-style diet on clinical endpoints and CVD risk factors for both primary and secondary prevention. The quality of evidence for the modest benefits on CVD risk factors in primary prevention is low or moderate, with a small number of studies reporting minimal harms. There is a paucity of evidence for secondary prevention. The ongoing studies may provide more certainty in the future.","It is well established that diet plays a major role in cardiovascular disease risk. The traditional Mediterranean dietary pattern is of particular interest because of observations from the 1960s that populations in countries of the Mediterranean region, such as Greece and Italy, had lower mortality from cardiovascular disease compared with northern European populations or the US, probably as a result of different eating habits.
This review assessed the effects of providing dietary advice to follow a Mediterranean-style diet or provision of foods relevant to the diet (or both) to healthy adults, people at increased risk of cardiovascular disease and those with cardiovascular disease, in order to prevent the occurrence or recurrence of cardiovascular disease and reduce the risk factors associated with it. Definitions of a Mediterranean dietary pattern vary and we included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions that reported both of the following key components: a high monounsaturated/saturated fat ratio (use of olive oil as main cooking ingredient and/or consumption of other traditional foods high in monounsaturated fats such as tree nuts) and a high intake of plant-based foods, including fruits, vegetables and legumes. Additional components included: low to moderate red wine consumption; high consumption of whole grains and cereals; low consumption of meat and meat products and increased consumption of fish; moderate consumption of milk and dairy products. The control group was no intervention or minimal intervention, usual care or another dietary intervention. We found 30 RCTs (49 papers) that met these criteria. The trials varied enormously in the participants recruited and the different dietary interventions. We grouped studies to look at the effects of following a Mediterranean-style diet into the following four categories to help us with our interpretation of the results:
1. Mediterranean dietary intervention compared to no intervention or a minimal intervention to prevent the onset of cardiovascular disease;
2. Mediterranean dietary intervention compared to another dietary intervention to prevent the onset of cardiovascular disease;
3. Mediterranean dietary intervention compared to usual care for people with cardiovascular disease to prevent recurrence;
4. Mediterranean dietary intervention compared to another dietary intervention for people with cardiovascular disease to prevent recurrence.
Few trials reported on the occurrence of cardiovascular disease either in those with or without disease to begin with. A large trial in people at high risk of cardiovascular disease found a benefit of the Mediterranean dietary intervention compared to a low-fat diet on the risk of having a stroke, but not on heart attacks, death from heart disease or other causes. A further study in people with cardiovascular disease found a benefit of the Mediterranean dietary intervention on death from heart disease or other causes. We rated these two studies as providing low to moderate-quality evidence. We had to exclude two studies from our analyses as concerns had been raised that the data were unreliable. The other trials in the review measured risk factors for cardiovascular disease. There was low to moderate-quality evidence for some beneficial changes in lipid levels and blood pressure with a Mediterranean-style diet in people without disease. In people with cardiovascular disease already there was very low to low-quality evidence that there was no effect of a Mediterranean-style diet on risk factors. Two trials reported side effects of the diet that were either absent or minor.
The review concludes that, despite the large number of included trials, there is still uncertainty regarding the effects of a Mediterranean-style diet on cardiovascular disease occurrence and risk factors in people both with and without cardiovascular disease already. We did find seven studies that are still ongoing and when we have the results from these we will incorporate them into the review to help reduce the uncertainty.",1047,Mediterranean dietary pattern; cardiovascular disease; primary prevention; secondary prevention; monounsaturated fats; PREDIMED trial; CVD mortality; Lyon Diet Heart Study; systolic blood pressure; diastolic blood pressure,Which of the following can be deduced about the benefits of a Mediterranean-style diet based on the trials included in the review?,How might one evaluate the reliability of the evidence regarding the Mediterranean diet's effect on CVD occurrence?,Select all of the following that are colors,What conclusions can be drawn about the role of the Mediterranean diet specifically in stroke prevention?,What was the primary focus of the study?,It provides definitive protection against all cardiovascular events.; It has modest benefits on certain risk factors for cardiovascular disease.; It significantly reduces the occurrence of cardiovascular disease in all demographics.,It has modest benefits on certain risk factors for cardiovascular disease.,By considering the number of participants involved in the trials.; By assessing the consistency of outcomes across different studies.; By reviewing the dietary components included in each trial.,By considering the number of participants involved in the trials.; By assessing the consistency of outcomes across different studies.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,"The Mediterranean diet shows potential benefits in reducing stroke risk according to low to moderate-quality evidence.; There is strong, high-quality evidence supporting the Mediterranean diet as a primary prevention method for strokes.; The evidence is insufficient to draw any conclusions about stroke prevention.",The Mediterranean diet shows potential benefits in reducing stroke risk according to low to moderate-quality evidence.,Effects of pharmaceuticals on cardiovascular disease; Effects of a Mediterranean-style diet on cardiovascular disease; Effects of exercise on cardiovascular disease,Effects of a Mediterranean-style diet on cardiovascular disease
628eada3a9c9e0776884f27d,interactive_4,Do education programmes improve outcomes in people with both chronic kidney disease and diabetes?,"Adherence to complex regimens for people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes is often poor. Interventions to enhance adherence require intensive education and behavioural counselling. However, whether the existing evidence is scientifically rigorous and can support recommendations for routine use of educational programmes in people with CKD and diabetes is still unknown. This is an update of a review first published in 2011.
To evaluate the benefits and harms of education programmes for people with CKD and diabetes. We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 19 July 2024 using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs investigating the benefits and harms of educational programmes (information and behavioural instructions and advice given by a healthcare provider, who could be a nurse, pharmacist, educator, health professional, medical practitioner, or healthcare provider, through verbal, written, audio-recording, or computer-aided modalities) for people 18 years and older with CKD and diabetes.
Two authors independently screened the literature, determined study eligibility, assessed quality, and extracted and entered data. We expressed dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and continuous data as mean difference (MD) with 95% CI. Data were pooled using the random-effects model. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Eight studies (13 reports, 840 randomised participants) were included. The overall risk of bias was low for objective outcomes and attrition bias, unclear for selection bias, reporting bias and other biases, and high for subjective outcomes. Education programmes compared to routine care alone probably decrease glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) (4 studies, 467 participants: MD -0.42%, 95% CI -0.53 to -0.31; moderate certainty evidence; 13.5 months follow-up) and may decrease total cholesterol (179 participants: MD -0.35 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.63 to -00.07; low certainty evidence) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (179 participants: MD -0.40 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.65 to -0.14; low certainty evidence) at 18 months of follow-up. One study (83 participants) reported education programmes for people receiving dialysis who have diabetes may improve the diabetes knowledge of diagnosis, monitoring, hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia, medication with insulin, oral medication, personal health habits, diet, exercise, chronic complications, and living with diabetes and coping with stress (all low certainty evidence). There may be an improvement in the general knowledge of diabetes at the end of the intervention and at the end of the three-month follow-up (one study, 97 participants; low certainty evidence) in people with diabetes and moderately increased albuminuria (A2). In participants with diabetes and moderately increased albuminuria (A2) (one study, 97 participants), education programmes may improve a participantÃÆÃÆÃâÃÂ¢ÃÆÃâÃâÃâ¬ÃÆÃâÃâÃâ¢s beliefs in treatment effectiveness and total self-efficacy at the end of five weeks compared to routine care (low certainty evidence). Self-efficacy for in-home blood glucose monitoring and beliefs in personal control may increase at the end of the three-month follow-up (low certainty evidence). There were no differences in other self-efficacy measures. One study (100 participants) reported an education programme may increase change in behaviour for general diet, specific diet and home blood glucose monitoring at the end of treatment (low certainty evidence); however, at the end of three months of follow-up, there may be no difference in any behaviour change outcomes (all low certainty evidence). There were uncertain effects on death, serious hypoglycaemia, and kidney failure due to very low certainty evidence. No data was available for changes in kidney function (creatinine clearance, serum creatinine, doubling of serum creatinine or proteinuria). For an education programme plus multidisciplinary, co-ordinated care compared to routine care, there may be little or no difference in HbA1c, kidney failure, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), systolic or diastolic blood pressure, hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia, and LDL and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (all low certainty evidence in participants with type-2 diabetes mellitus and documented advanced diabetic nephropathy). There were no data for death, patient-orientated measures, change in kidney function (other than eGFR and albuminuria), cardiovascular disease morbidity, quality of life, or adverse events. Education programmes may improve knowledge of some areas related to diabetes care and some self-management practices. Education programmes probably decrease HbA1c in people with CKD and diabetes, but the effect on other clinical outcomes is unclear. This review only included eight studies with small sample sizes. Therefore, more randomised studies are needed to examine the efficacy of education programmes on important clinical outcomes in people with CKD and diabetes.","Chronic kidney disease (a long-term condition where the kidneys do not work effectively) and diabetes (a lifelong condition that causes a person's blood sugar level to become too high) are chronic conditions that bring on many challenges for people, particularly when they have to manage both at the same time. Diabetes can accelerate the development of kidney disease and is the leading cause of kidney failure (a condition where the kidneys no longer function well enough to keep a person alive). While sticking to complex treatment plans can be challenging, successful self-management in the early stages of kidney disease can improve outcomes later in life and delay the need for dialysis or a kidney transplant. Education programmes are any set of planned activities designed to improve a person's ability to manage their condition and delay the progression of their kidney disease. These activities can aim to improve a person's knowledge of their disease, self-care activities, and their ability to self-monitor the disease, thus encouraging and motivating them to create healthy lifestyle changes, improve their treatment compliance, and improve quality of life. We wanted to find out whether an education programme designed for people with both kidney disease and diabetes helps them understand their condition and recognise the importance of strategies aimed at slowing its progression and preventing long-term complications. We searched for randomised studies (studies in which participants are assigned randomly to two or more treatment groups) that compared education programmes to usual care for people with both kidney disease and diabetes. We compared and summarised the results and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and sizes.
We included eight studies involving 840 people 18 years or older with both kidney disease and diabetes. Four studies were undertaken in multiple centres, and four studies were performed in single centres. The duration of follow-up ranged from 12 weeks to four years. Most of the education programmes were designed to increase a person's knowledge of their condition and improve self-management behaviours. One study focused on reducing stress using mindfulness (a person's ability to be aware of where they are and what they are doing), and it was adapted to include practices for complex thoughts and feelings related to diabetes, and one study used a co-ordinated medical care approach with multiple practitioners involved in a person's care. Overall, education programmes probably lower blood glucose levels and may lower total cholesterol and blood pressure, but may make little or no difference to kidney function, abnormally low or high blood sugar, and cardiovascular disease (disorders of the heart and blood vessels). For people with diabetes on dialysis (a procedure to remove waste products and excess fluid from the blood when the kidneys stop working properly), an education programme may improve their knowledge of diabetes, self-management behaviour for checking their feet, using lotion, wearing appropriate shoes and socks, and coping with stress. For people with moderately increased protein in the urine, there may be an improvement in their general knowledge of diabetes, their confidence in monitoring their blood sugar levels at home, their beliefs in their personal control, as well as behavioural changes to their diet. There may be no behavioural changes to exercise, foot care, or quitting smoking.
We have low confidence in education programmes improving the understanding of diabetes in people with kidney disease. This is because the number of studies reporting outcomes of interest was low, and the education programmes varied, so we were unable to properly analyse the results.",1082,Chronic kidney disease; HbA1c; Low-density lipoprotein; Moderately increased albuminuria; Education programmes; Multi-disciplinary coordinated care; Estimated glomerular filtration rate; Hyperglycaemia; Diabetic nephropathy; Self-efficacy,Which factors may influence the validity of the education programme outcomes in the study?,What criteria were used to determine the study's confidence in the evidence of educational programme outcomes?,Select all of the following that are fruits,Evaluate the potential limitations of the study's findings on education programmes.,What effect do education programmes have on self-monitoring practices?,Variability in programme design and delivery.; Limited participant age range.; Inconsistent follow-up durations.,Variability in programme design and delivery.; Inconsistent follow-up durations.,Study methods and sizes.; Geographic diversity of centres.; Participant demographics.,Study methods and sizes.,dog; blue; grape,grape,Limited number of studies and participants.; Inconsistent reporting of follow-up data.; Variety in educational programme approaches.,Limited number of studies and participants.; Variety in educational programme approaches.,They may improve confidence in home blood sugar monitoring.; They may decrease interest in self-monitoring.; They significantly improve kidney function.,They may improve confidence in home blood sugar monitoring.
628eada3a9c9e0776884f27d,finetuned_5,Melatonin and agomelatine for prevention of winter depression,"Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a seasonal pattern of recurrent major depressive episodes that most commonly starts in autumn or winter and remits in spring. The prevalence of SAD depends on latitude and ranges from 1.5% to 9%. The predictable seasonal aspect of SAD provides a promising opportunity for prevention in people who have a history of SAD. This is one of four reviews on the efficacy and safety of interventions to prevent SAD; we focus on agomelatine and melatonin as preventive interventions. To assess the efficacy and safety of agomelatine and melatonin (in comparison with each other, placebo, second-generation antidepressants, light therapy, psychological therapy or lifestyle interventions) in preventing SAD and improving person-centred outcomes among adults with a history of SAD. We searched Ovid MEDLINE (1950- ), Embase (1974- ), PsycINFO (1967- ) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to 19 June 2018. An earlier search of these databases was conducted via the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trial Register (CCMD-CTR) (all years to 11 August 2015). Furthermore, we searched the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database and international trial registers (to 19 June 2018). We also conducted a grey literature search and handsearched the reference lists of included studies and pertinent review articles. To examine efficacy, we included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on adults with a history of winter-type SAD who were free of symptoms at the beginning of the study. For adverse events, we intended also to include non-randomised studies. We planned to include studies that compared agomelatine versus melatonin, or agomelatine or melatonin versus placebo, any second-generation antidepressant, light therapy, psychological therapies or lifestyle changes. We also intended to compare melatonin or agomelatine in combination with any of the comparator interventions mentioned above versus the same comparator intervention as monotherapy.
Two review authors screened abstracts and full-text publications, abstracted data and assessed risk of bias of included studies independently. We intended to pool data in a meta-analysis using a random-effects model, but included only one study. We identified 3745 citations through electronic searches and reviews of reference lists after deduplication of search results. We excluded 3619 records during title and abstract review and assessed 126 full-text papers for inclusion in the review. Only one study, providing data of 225 participants, met our eligibility criteria and compared agomelatine (25 mg/day) with placebo. We rated it as having high risk of attrition bias because nearly half of the participants left the study before completion. We rated the certainty of the evidence as very low for all outcomes, because of high risk of bias, indirectness, and imprecision. The main analysis based on data of 199 participants rendered an indeterminate result with wide confidence intervals (CIs) that may encompass both a relevant reduction as well as a relevant increase of SAD incidence by agomelatine (risk ratio (RR) 0.83, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.34; 199 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Also the severity of SAD may be similar in both groups at the end of the study with a mean SIGH-SAD (Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Seasonal Affective Disorders) score of 8.3 (standard deviation (SD) 9.4) in the agomelatine group and 10.1 (SD 10.6) in the placebo group (mean difference (MD) -1.80, 95% CI -4.58 to 0.98; 199 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events may be similar in both groups. In the agomelatine group, 64 out of 112 participants experienced at least one adverse event, while 61 out of 113 did in the placebo group (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.34; 225 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Three out of 112 patients experienced serious adverse events in the agomelatine group, compared to 4 out of 113 in the placebo group (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.17 to 3.30; 225 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No data on quality of life or interpersonal functioning were reported. We did not identify any studies on melatonin.
Given the uncertain evidence on agomelatine and the absence of studies on melatonin, no conclusion about efficacy and safety of agomelatine and melatonin for prevention of SAD can currently be drawn. The decision for or against initiating preventive treatment of SAD and the treatment selected should consider patient preferences and reflect on the evidence base of all available treatment options.","Many people in northern latitudes suffer from seasonal affective disorder (SAD), which occurs as a reaction to reduced sunlight. Three-quarters of those affected are women. Lethargy, overeating, craving for carbohydrates and depressed mood are common symptoms. In some people, SAD becomes depression that seriously affects their daily lives. Up to two-thirds experience depressive symptoms every winter. General practitioners, psychiatrists, pharmacists, other health professionals working in adult mental health services, and researchers could be interested in the results of this review. Anyone who has experienced winter depression, or who has friends or relatives who have experienced winter depression might also be interested. Because of the seasonal pattern and high recurrence of SAD, melatonin or agomelatine could be used to prevent the onset of depressed mood. The goal of this report is to examine whether benefits outweigh harms of melatonin or agomelatine when used to prevent onset of a new depressive episode in people with a history of SAD who were free of symptoms when the preventive intervention started. To date, this question has not been examined in a systematic way. This is one of four reviews on the efficacy and potential harms of interventions to prevent SAD. We searched databases up to June 2018 for studies on melatonin or agomelatine for prevention of winter depression. Among 3745 records, we found one randomised controlled study comparing agomelatine with placebo for one year. All 225 participants had a history of winter depression but were not depressed when the prevention study started. The included study showed neither a clear effect in favour nor against agomelatine as a preventive treatment. In addition, the certainty of evidence for all outcomes was very low, making it impossible to draw any conclusions about the efficacy and safety of agomelatine for the prevention of winter depression. No evidence on melatonin for prevention of SAD was identified. Doctors need to discuss with persons with a history of SAD that currently evidence on agomelatine or melatonin for preventive treatment options for SAD is inconclusive, therefore treatment selection should be strongly based on peoples' preferences and reflect on the evidence base of all available treatment options. Review authors recommend that future studies should evaluate the efficacy of agomelatine or melatonin in preventing SAD and should directly compare these interventions against other treatment options, such as light therapy, antidepressants, or psychological therapies to determine the best treatment option for prevention of SAD.",1121,Seasonal affective disorder; major depressive episodes; agomelatine; melatonin; light therapy; psychological therapy; lifestyle interventions,How do the motivations for investigating agomelatine and melatonin for SAD prevention reflect the challenges faced by northern populations?,How can the findings from this review be integrated into future studies for a more definitive conclusion on the use of agomelatine?,Select all of the following that are colors,"Based on the review, what criteria should healthcare providers consider when discussing treatment options for SAD with patients?",How does the report suggest assessing treatment options for SAD prevention?,The seasonal variation in sunlight uniquely affects mental health in these regions.; The general practitioners in these regions prefer these medications.; There is a cultural significance to using these treatments in northern latitudes.,The seasonal variation in sunlight uniquely affects mental health in these regions.,Design studies that directly compare agomelatine with other established treatments.; Limit research to uncontrolled observational studies.; Focus solely on patient preference surveys in future studies.,Design studies that directly compare agomelatine with other established treatments.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Evidence base and patient preferences.; Brand reputation of agomelatine and melatonin.; Cost of treatment as the primary factor.,Evidence base and patient preferences.,Based on patient preferences; Random selection; Popularity of the treatment,Based on patient preferences

There has been increasing interest in developing innovative, effective and cost-efficient methods to engage with patient populations and improve health behaviours and outcomes. Worldwide there has been a tremendous increase in the use of technologies, with increasing interest in using eHealth interventions to improve patient access to relevant health information, enhance the quality of healthcare and encourage the adoption of healthy behaviours. This review aims to evaluate the benefits and harms of using eHealth interventions to change health behaviours in people with CKD. We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 14 January 2019 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs using an eHealth intervention to promote behaviour change in people with CKD were included. There were no restrictions on outcomes, language or publication type. Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. We included 43 studies with 6617 participants that evaluated the impact of an eHealth intervention in people with CKD. Included studies were heterogeneous in terms of eHealth modalities employed, type of intervention, CKD population studied and outcomes assessed. The majority of studies (39 studies) were conducted in an adult population, with 16 studies (37%) conducted in those on dialysis, 11 studies (26%) in the pre-dialysis population, 15 studies (35%) in transplant recipients and 1 studies (2%) in transplant candidates We identified six different eHealth modalities including: Telehealth; mobile or tablet application; text or email messages; electronic monitors; internet/websites; and video or DVD. Three studies used a combination of eHealth interventions. Interventions were categorised into six types: educational; reminder systems; self-monitoring; behavioural counselling; clinical decision-aid; and mixed intervention types. We identified 98 outcomes, which were categorised into nine domains: blood pressure (9 studies); biochemical parameters (6 studies); clinical end-points (16 studies); dietary intake (3 studies); quality of life (9 studies); medication adherence (10 studies); behaviour (7 studies); physical activity (1 study); and cost-effectiveness (7 studies). Only three outcomes could be meta-analysed as there was substantial heterogeneity with respect to study population and eHealth modalities utilised. There was found to be a reduction in interdialytic weight gain of 0.13kg (4 studies, 335 participants: MD -0.13, 95% CI -0.28 to 0.01; I2= 0%) and a reduction in dietary sodium intake of 197 mg/day (2 studies, 181 participants: MD -197, 95% CI -540.7 to 146.8; I2= 0%). Both dietary sodium and fluid management outcomes were graded as being of low evidence due to high or unclear risk of bias and indirectness (interdialytic weight gain) and high or unclear risk of bias and imprecision (dietary sodium intake). Three studies reported death (2799 participants, 146 events), with 45 deaths/1000 cases compared to standard care of 61 deaths/1000 cases (RR 0.74, CI 0.53 to 1.03; P = 0.08). We are uncertain whether using eHealth interventions, in addition to usual care, impact on the number of deaths as the certainty of this evidence was graded as low due to high or unclear risk of bias, indirectness and imprecision. eHealth interventions may improve the management of dietary sodium intake and fluid management. However, overall these data suggest that current evidence for the use of eHealth interventions in the CKD population is of low quality, with uncertain effects due to methodological limitations and heterogeneity of eHealth modalities and intervention types. Our review has highlighted the need for robust, high quality research that reports a core (minimum) data set to enable meaningful evaluation of the literature.","Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a condition in which kidney function declines over time, and people with CKD must follow complex dietary, lifestyle, and medication recommendations while often relying on multiple specialist healthcare services. Those with advanced CKD may require dialysis or a kidney transplant. Helping patients manage their condition themselves can improve quality and length of life and reduce healthcare costs. Electronic health (eHealth) interventions defined as health services and information delivered or enhanced through the Internet and related technologies may support self-management and improve healthcare delivery, but there is limited research on their impact in CKD. We reviewed randomized controlled trials that enrolled people with CKD (including pre-dialysis, dialysis, or kidney transplant recipients) and compared eHealth interventions to usual care. We identified 43 studies involving 6617 participants. eHealth interventions used various technologies such as telehealth, electronic monitors, mobile or tablet apps, text messages or emails, websites, and videos. Interventions were categorized by purpose: education, reminders, self-monitoring, behavioural counselling, clinical decision-aids, and mixed approaches. Outcomes were grouped into nine domains, including diet, quality of life, blood pressure, medication adherence, laboratory results, cost, behaviour, physical activity, and clinical endpoints such as mortality. Overall, it was uncertain whether eHealth interventions improved clinical or patient-centred outcomes compared with usual care. Study quality was low, so it remains unclear whether future high-quality trials would show different results. We therefore remain uncertain about the effectiveness of eHealth interventions for people with CKD and need larger, well-designed studies to understand their true impact.",1083,Chronic kidney disease; end-stage kidney disease; eHealth interventions; interdialytic weight gain; dietary sodium intake; transplant candidates; biochemical parameters; medication adherence; behavioural counselling; clinical decision-aid,"In analyzing the motivations behind evaluating eHealth interventions, what potential benefits are anticipated for CKD patients?",What technologies were included in the eHealth interventions?,Select all of the following that are colors,Summarize the main outcome of using eHealth interventions in people with CKD.,What does the study suggest about the current evidence of eHealth interventions for CKD?,Improved self-management skills; Immediate improvement in kidney function; Enhanced healthcare delivery,Improved self-management skills; Enhanced healthcare delivery,Telehealth; Invasive surgical tools; Electronic monitors,Telehealth; Electronic monitors,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Uncertain impact on improving outcomes; Definite improvements in all outcomes; No changes observed,Uncertain impact on improving outcomes,Low quality and uncertain effects; High quality with consistent findings; No evidence available,Low quality and uncertain effects
628eada3a9c9e0776884f27d,finetuned_6,Use of medication to treat depression in people with opioid dependence,"Lifetime prevalence of depression in subjects with opioid dependence is higher than in the general population (44-54% versus 16%) and represents a risk factor for morbidity and mortality. For patients on opioid agonist treatment, current prevalence rates of depression ranges between 10 and 30%, influencing negatively the outcome of the treatment. To evaluate the efficacy and the acceptability of antidepressants for the treatment of depressed opioid dependents treated with opioid agonists. We searched Pubmed, EMBASE, CINAHL (to October 2009), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library Cochrane Drug and Alcohol Group Specialised Register, issue 4, 2009), main electronic sources of ongoing trials, specific trial databases and reference lists of all relevant papers. Randomised and controlled clinical trials examining the efficacy of any antidepressant medication to treat depressed opioid dependents in treatment with opioid agonists. Two authors independently screened and extracted data from studies. Seven studies, 482 participants, met the inclusion criteria.  Comparing antidepressant with placebo, no statistically significant results for dropouts. Selecting studies with low risk of bias, 325 participants, results favour placebo, RR 1.40 (Cl 95% 1.00 to 1.96). For severity of depression, results from two studies, 183 participants, favour antidepressants utilising Clinical Global Impression Scale RR 1.92 (CI 95% 1.26 to 2.94), while another study, 95 participants, utilising the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, did not find a statistically significant difference RR 0.96 (CI 95% 0.54 to 1.71). For adverse events, result favour placebo, four studies, 311 participants, RR 2.90 (Cl 95% 1.23 to 6.86). For drug use, three studies, 211 participants, it was not possible to pool data because outcomes' measures were not comparable. Looking at singular studies, no statistically significant difference was seen. - Comparing different classes of antidepressants, the results favour tricyclics for severity of depression, two studies, 183 participants, RR 1.92 (Cl 95% 1.26 to 2.94) and favour placebo for adverse events, two studies, 172 participants, RR 3.11 (Cl 95% 1.06 to 9.12). There is low evidence, at the present, supporting the clinical use of antidepressants for the treatment of depressed opioid addicts in treatment with opioid agonists. There is a need of larger randomised studies investigating relevant outcomes, safety issues and reporting data to allow comparison of results.","There is little evidence to support the use of antidepressants for treating people who are dependent on opioids and have clinical depression. Depression is more common in people with substance abuse and dependence than in the general population. The depression experienced is also associated with an increased risk of completed suicide. Depression may represent an independent disorder, the psychosocial stress associated with addictive behavior or it could be a consequence of drug use and drug withdrawal effects. A maintenance program with opioid agonists (methadone, buprenorphine, LAAM) is an effective treatment for people who are dependent on opioids in terms of retention in treatment and reduced use of opioids. Depression is however still prevalent and negatively impacts on treatment outcomes. Treatment with antidepressant drugs has therefore been proposed. These adjunct drug treatments include tricyclic antidepressants (doxepin, desipramine, imipramine) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs fluoxetine, sertraline). Authors included seven randomised controlled studies that involved 482 participants in our review. The studies were conducted in outpatient settings over four to 16 weeks; six were in USA and one in Australia. The mean age of participants was 34 years and 62% were males. No clear difference was found in the number of dropouts from an opioid agonist maintenance program between people receiving antidepressants and those in the placebo groups. Neither was drug use different (two studies). Severity of depression was reduced with the use of antidepressants (two studies), including tricyclic antidepressants. Adverse events were important as more of the participants who received antidepressants withdrew from the studies for medical reasons compared with those participants on placebo (four studies). The differences between studies in clinical (participant characteristics, the medications used, services and treatments delivered) and methodological characteristics (study design and quality) made it difficult to draw confident conclusions about the efficacy and safety of antidepressants for the treatment of depression in people who are dependent on opioids.",1118,depression; opioid dependence; opioid agonist treatment; antidepressants; tricyclics; adverse events,How does the presence of depression influence the outcomes of opioid agonist treatments according to the study?,What criteria should future studies meet to improve evidence on the efficacy of antidepressants for opioid-dependent individuals?,Select all of the following that are colors,What is the main conclusion about antidepressant use for opioid dependents?,"In the summary, how did adverse events affect antidepressant use in the studies?",It enhances the retention of participants in treatment programs.; It negatively impacts the treatment outcomes.; It has no significant impact on treatment outcomes.,It negatively impacts the treatment outcomes.,Larger randomized trials with relevant outcome reporting.; Increased focus on drug misuse prevention.; Studies with diverse participant characteristics.,Larger randomized trials with relevant outcome reporting.; Studies with diverse participant characteristics.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Little evidence supports their use; They are highly recommended; They completely cure both addiction and depression,Little evidence supports their use,They led to more study withdrawals; They had no impact on the studies; They improved retention in studies,They led to more study withdrawals
5eceed79840590300f53fa51,static_1,Do dietary and activity strategies help prevent obesity in children aged 2 to 4 years?,"To assess the effects of interventions that aimed to prevent obesity in children aged two to four years by changing dietary intake or activity levels, or both, on body mass index (BMI), BMI z-score (zBMI), BMI percentile, and serious adverse events. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, six other databases, and two trial registers, together with reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors to identify eligible studies. The latest search date was 7 February 2023. In early childhood, combined dietary/activity interventions may have very modest benefits on BMI and zBMI at long-term follow-up. When implemented alone, dietary or activity interventions may have little to no effect on BMI measures. Only six studies reported serious adverse events, with no serious harms resulting directly from the intervention, but the evidence is very uncertain.","There is an increasing number of young children living with overweight and obesity worldwide, with evidence of the rates increasing in line with social inequality. Living with overweight during childhood can cause physical and psychological health problems. Children living with overweight are more likely to live with overweight as adults, and continue to experience poor physical and mental health. We wanted to find out if strategies to help people change diet or activity (or both) are effective at preventing obesity in children aged 2 to 4 years, and whether they are associated with any serious adverse events. To examine obesity, we used the measure of body mass index (BMI). BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by their height (in m2). We searched for studies that looked at ways to prevent obesity in children aged 2 to 4 years. We did not include studies that only targeted children who were already living with overweight or obesity, but we did include studies involving children at a range of weights. We only included studies if they used methods aimed at changing children's diet, activity level (increasing physical activity or reducing sedentary behaviour), or both. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We grouped studies together for analysis depending on whether they aimed to improve diet, activity, or both. We found 67 studies involving 36,601 children aged 2 to 4 years. Most studies (63 of 67) were based in high-income countries, and four in upper-middle-income countries. In 26 studies, the strategies were conducted in childcare settings, 23 studies were primarily home-based, and 10 were performed in both childcare and home-based settings. Only 3 studies were conducted in the community, and 5 in healthcare settings. The duration of the programmes varied: 47 ran for fewer than 9 months, with the shortest being 1 visit and the longest lasting 3 years. We analysed results from 56 studies involving 21,404 children. Children who were helped with a strategy to change their diet and activity levels may have had a reduced BMI, compared with children not given any strategy. This means that these children may have been able to minimise excess weight gain by a small amount, which, for public health, is important. Children who were helped with a strategy to change their diet or activity alone did not have a reduced BMI. Only six of the 67 included studies reported on serious adverse events, and no serious harms were identified. Overall, our confidence in the evidence is very low. However, we do not believe that results from more studies similar in design to those included in this review would produce a higher level of confidence in the results. Four main factors reduced our confidence in the evidence. Results were very inconsistent across different studies. There were not enough studies reporting specific types of outcomes for a particular duration of follow-up to be certain about the results for some comparisons. Results from some studies were not reported in a way that we could include in our analyses and this may have had an impact on the combined results. Studies generally had limitations in how they were conducted, due to the complexity of studies in this age group.

5eceed79840590300f53fa51,static_2,Immunosuppressive treatment for adults with idiopathic membranous nephropathy,"Primary membranous nephropathy (PMN) is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults, and without treatment about one-third of patients experience spontaneous remission, one-third have persistent proteinuria, and one-third progress to end?stage kidney disease (ESKD) within 10 years. Immunosuppressive therapy is used to protect kidney function in patients who do not improve with supportive treatment or who present with severe nephrotic syndrome, but the relative safety and effectiveness of different treatments have been unclear. This updated review included 65 studies involving 3807 adults with PMN and found that, compared with placebo or no immunosuppression, immunosuppressive therapy probably reduces the risk of progressing to ESKD, increases the likelihood of complete or partial remission, and lowers the number of people whose serum creatinine doubles, though it probably makes little or no difference to mortality. However, immunosuppressive therapy may increase relapse after remission and may increase temporary or permanent treatment discontinuation due to adverse effects, while its effects on infection and malignancy remain uncertain. Oral alkylating agents with or without steroids may reduce the risk of ESKD and may increase remission rates but also may lead to more treatment?related adverse events, and their effects on relapse, creatinine progression, infection, and malignancy remain uncertain. Evidence for calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus or cyclosporine), with or without steroids, was very uncertain, including whether they affect remission, relapse, ESKD, or adverse events. When calcineurin inhibitors were compared to alkylating agents, they appeared similarly effective for achieving remission but may result in higher relapse rates, though the overall certainty of evidence was low to moderate. Other treatments such as azathioprine, mizoribine, adrenocorticotropic hormone, traditional Chinese medicines, and rituximab had insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions. Overall, immunosuppressive therapy appears more effective than non-immunosuppressive management for inducing remission and reducing progression to ESKD, but this must be weighed against higher risks of adverse effects, and the evidence base remains limited by small sample sizes, high risk of bias, and inadequate follow-up. Alkylating agents combined with corticosteroids show both short- and long-term benefits but also higher toxicity, calcineurin inhibitors show similar efficacy but uncertain long-term safety, and biologics such as rituximab require further large, high-quality trials to determine their role.","Primary membranous nephropathy (PMN) is an autoimmune disease, where the body's immune system attacks the kidneys. The term ""primary"" is used to describe membranous nephropathy that is not caused by another disease in the body. PMN is a leading cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults. Nephrotic syndrome is a condition, where the membrane of the kidney is damaged and becomes permeable for proteins. Primary membranous nephropathy is diagnosed through findings in a kidney biopsy and the presence of nephrotic syndrome. PMN is not harmful in about one-third of patients, who will have a spontaneous ""complete remission"", which means that the disease will resolve by itself. However, about another one third will experience spontaneous remission but will have some protein in the urine that continues with normal kidney function. These patients usually only require supportive treatments that do not interact with the immune system. Without treatment, about 15% to 50% of patients progress to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) within 10 years. In some patients, PMN can be severe or continues to get worse even after using 6 months of supportive treatments. In these patients, extra treatment that dampens the activity of the immune system may be used to reduce damage to the kidney. It is not clear which of these treatment(s) is the most helpful and what side effects can occur. Therefore, the duration and intensity of immunosuppressive treatment need to be balanced against possible side effects. There are different classes of drugs used in immunosuppressive therapy. These drugs may or may not be combined with corticosteroids (drugs based on the body's stress response hormone cortisol). We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant specialised register up to 1 April 2021. We have combined studies to compare different treatment regimens with immunosuppressive therapy to assess which treatments help to treat patients with PMN and nephrotic syndrome with the least side effects. This review identified sixty-five studies with 3807 patients. Different types of immunosuppressive treatment include alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil), calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus and cyclosporine), antimetabolites (mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine), biologicals (e.g. rituximab) and adrenocorticotropic hormone. These drugs may or may not be combined with corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone), which also suppresses the immune system. After combining the results of available studies together, we found that compared with no treatment, supportive treatment or steroids alone, the use of immunosuppressive treatment probably reduced the number of patients who progressed to ESKD by about 40% and increased the number of patients that achieved complete remission. However, immunosuppressive treatment may lead to more adverse events, which can cause treatment to be stopped or lead to the patients needing to go to hospital. The different drugs that can be used in the immunosuppressive treatment were also examined in our review. We found that alkylating agents probably increases complete remission but may lead to more adverse events. We are uncertain whether alkylating agents increase infection or cancer. Based on the currently available evidence, the effectiveness of using calcineurin inhibitors is still unclear, but there is low certainty of the evidence, that CNI may lead to similar remission rates compared to alkylating agents.
Furthermore, other treatment options such as mycophenolate mofetil, adrenocorticotropic hormone, rituximab and others have only been examined in a few studies. There is not enough data to draw final conclusions on the use of these treatments in adults with PMN and nephrotic syndrome. The treatment of patients with PMN and nephrotic syndrome with immunosuppressive therapy compared to no treatment or supportive therapy alone probably protects the kidney but may increase side effects. A combination of immunosuppressive therapy with steroids may decrease disease activity and the use of alkylating agent combined with steroids probably has the short-term and long-term benefits of limiting damage to the kidney. Other therapies such as calcineurin inhibitors, mycophenolate mofetil, rituximab and adrenocorticotropic hormone have less certainty regarding their safety and effectiveness from these studies.",1086,Primary membranous nephropathy; nephrotic syndrome; immunosuppressive therapy; end-stage kidney disease; proteinuria; spontaneous remission; serum creatinine; alkylating agents; calcineurin inhibitors; rituximab,What is primary membranous nephropathy (PMN) primarily characterized by?,"In the context of PMN, what does spontaneous remission imply?",Select all of the following that are fruits,Which type of PMN patients might require immunosuppressive therapy?,What is a primary goal of immunosuppressive therapy in PMN treatment?,An autoimmune attack on the kidneys; A viral infection affecting the kidneys; A genetic disorder affecting the kidneys,An autoimmune attack on the kidneys,The disease resolves by itself; Immediate need for immunosuppressive therapy; Progression to end-stage kidney disease,The disease resolves by itself,dog; blue; grape,grape,Patients with spontaneous complete remission; Patients with severe or worsening PMN; All patients with nephrotic syndrome,Patients with severe or worsening PMN,To reduce the progression to end-stage kidney disease; To increase proteinuria; To eliminate the need for biopsy,To reduce the progression to end-stage kidney disease
5eceed79840590300f53fa51,static_2,Is favipiravir useful in treating people with COVID-19?,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to challenge the health workforce and societies worldwide. Favipiravir was suggested by some experts to be effective and safe to use in COVID-19. Although this drug has been evaluated in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), it is still unclear if it has a definite role in the treatment of COVID-19. The aim of this Cochrane Review was to assess the effects of favipiravir compared to no treatment, supportive treatment, or other experimental antiviral treatment in people with acute COVID-19. Researchers searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, MEDLINE, Embase, the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease, and three other databases up to 18 July 2023 for RCTs evaluating the efficacy of favipiravir in treating people with COVID-19. Using standard Cochrane methodological procedures and the GRADE approach, they included 25 trials that randomized 5750 adults (most under 60 years of age) across multiple countries, with most participants hospitalized with mild to moderate disease (89%). Twenty-two trials compared favipiravir to placebo or standard of care, two used lopinavir/ritonavir, and one used umifenovir; most regimens began with 1600 mg or 1800 mg twice daily on day one, followed by 600 mg to 800 mg twice daily for five to 14 days. The evidence remains very uncertain regarding whether favipiravir reduces all-cause mortality at 28 to 30 days or in-hospital (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.46; 11 trials, 3459 participants), or whether it reduces progression to invasive mechanical ventilation (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.09; 8 trials, 1383 participants). Favipiravir may make little to no difference in the need for hospital admission among ambulatory patients (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.46; 4 trials, 670 participants), and the evidence is very uncertain regarding time to clinical improvement (HR 1.13, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.83; 4 trials, 721 participants). It may also make little to no difference in progression to oxygen therapy (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.75; 2 trials, 543 participants). Favipiravir may lead to an increased incidence of adverse events overall (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.54; 18 trials, 4699 participants), but may result in little to no difference in serious adverse events attributable to the drug (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.42; 12 trials, 3317 participants). Overall, low- to very low-certainty evidence means that it is not known whether favipiravir is efficacious in people with COVID-19 illness of any severity or admission status, and while treatment may increase general adverse events, it may not increase serious adverse events.","What is favipiravir? Favipiravir is a medicine that can fight viruses. It is usually taken by mouth. Originally used for treating other viral infections, favipiravir has been suggested as a potential treatment for COVID-19 as it prevents the reproduction of the virus. Medical regulators have approved favipiravir for emergency use to treat people with COVID-19. What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out if favipiravir was better than no treatment, supportive treatment, or any other experimental antiviral treatment for people with COVID-19, in terms of death, need for a breathing machine (mechanical ventilation), and other outcomes. We also wanted to find out if favipiravir was associated with any unwanted effects. What did we do? We searched for studies that compared favipiravir with no treatment, supportive treatment, or other antiviral treatment in people with COVID-19 disease. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. What did we find? We found 25 relevant studies involving 5750 people. The studies were conducted in 13 different countries: Bahrain, Brazil, China, India, Iran, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, the UK, and the USA. Most people were under 60 years old and had mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms. What are the main results of our review?  We do not know if favipiravir reduces the number of people who die from COVID-19 when compared to dummy treatment, standard of care, or other antiviral medicines. The evidence supporting this is not very strong (derived from 11 studies involving 3459 people). It is also very unclear if favipiravir reduces the need for people to be put on ventilators compared to a dummy treatment or any other antiviral treatments (derived from 8 studies involving 1383 people). In people with mild symptoms, using favipiravir may not reduce the likelihood of needing hospitalization, but more research is needed to be sure (derived from 4 studies involving 670 people). Favipiravir has an unclear effect on the time it takes for people to improve, as defined by a reduction in their illness severity (derived from 4 studies involving 721 people).  Favipiravir seems to make very little difference in reducing the need for treatment with oxygen, compared to a dummy treatment or other antiviral treatment (derived from 2 studies involving 543 people). Favipiravir might lead to mild side effects (derived from 18 studies involving 4699 people) but doesn't seem to cause major or severe side effects (derived from 12 studies involving 3317 people). What are the limitations of the evidence? Our confidence in the evidence for using favipiravir is limited because people in the studies had different disease severities and the studies were of varying sizes and had inconsistent results.",1107,COVID-19 pandemic; SARS-CoV-2; favipiravir; all-cause mortality; invasive mechanical ventilation; ambulatory patients; oxygen therapy; adverse events; serious adverse events; lopinavir/ritonavir,"In evaluating the study outcomes, how should the inconsistent results influence future clinical guidelines regarding favipiravir?",Which methodological approaches from this review could be enhanced to better support favipiravir efficacy conclusions in future studies?,Select all of the following that are fruits,"Based on the plain-language summary, how could the clarity of favipiravir's effects on mechanical ventilation be improved?",Which outcome did the research hope to clarify regarding favipiravir's effect?,Inconsistent results suggest caution in widespread use without further research.; Inconsistencies indicate immediate adoption into treatment protocols.; They show consistent efficacy across all outcomes.,Inconsistent results suggest caution in widespread use without further research.,Only include studies with the most positive outcomes.; Increase uniformity in disease severity among participants.; Focus exclusively on small-scale trials to ensure manageability.,Increase uniformity in disease severity among participants.,dog; blue; grape,grape,By increasing the number of studies focusing on severe cases.; By completely excluding severe cases from trials.; By reducing the number of studies included in the analysis.,By increasing the number of studies focusing on severe cases.,Need for mechanical ventilation; Cure for COVID-19; Prevention of new infections,Need for mechanical ventilation
5eceed79840590300f53fa51,interactive_3,Is liraglutide an effective weight-loss treatment for adults living with obesity and does it cause unwanted effects?,"To assess the effects of liraglutide, a GLP-1RA, for adults living with obesity, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and two trials registries on 17 December 2024. Liraglutide likely increases the proportion of people achieving at least 5% weight loss at medium-term follow-up; this effect is likely to be sustained at longer-term follow-up. Medium- or long-term impact on percentage weight change, MACE, quality of life, and mortality may be limited or uncertain. Liraglutide may lead to an increase in adverse events, including serious adverse events in both the medium and long term, which might further limit the sustainability of the initial effects. The drug manufacturer funded 22 studies, raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest. Further independent and long-term studies are needed to better understand the broader effects of liraglutide in the management of obesity.","Obesity is a long-term condition in which a person has too much body fat. It can increase the risk of health problems like type 2 diabetes, diseases of the heart and blood vessels (cardiovascular disease), and some types of cancer. Obesity levels are increasing worldwide, placing a significant burden on healthcare systems. Managing obesity usually involves lifestyle changes such as eating a healthier diet and being more physically active. However, many people find these changes difficult to maintain, and doctors may prescribe medications to support weight loss. Liraglutide is a type of medication that helps people feel full sooner, and so eat less. It was originally developed to treat type 2 diabetes but has been approved in many countries to help people lose weight. It is given as a daily injection. Some people taking liraglutide experience unwanted effects, such as feeling or being sick, diarrhoea and constipation. Liraglutide is a  GLP-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA). Similar medications include semaglutide and tirzepatide. We wanted to know how well liraglutide works in adults with obesity in the medium term (6 to 24 months) and long term (24 months or more). We examined its effects on weight, unwanted effects, obesity-related health problems, quality of life and risk of death. We did not look at what happens after people stop taking liraglutide. We searched for studies that investigated liraglutide for adults living with obesity. Studies could investigate any dose of liraglutide compared with placebo (sham medication), no treatment, lifestyle changes or another weight-loss medication. We included studies in which people took liraglutide for at least 6 months. We compared and analysed the results and assessed our confidence in the evidence. We found 24 studies with 9937 men and women with obesity, aged between 31 and 64 years. Some people had weight-related conditions like diabetes or liver disease. Most studies compared liraglutide with placebo. They mainly took place in high- and middle-income countries. People who took liraglutide were more likely to lose at least 5% of their body weight than those who took a placebo in the medium (18 studies, 6651 people) and long term (2 studies, 1262 people). However, we are uncertain about liraglutide's effects on people's overall percentage weight change from the beginning of the study to the medium term (16 studies, 6050 people) and there may be little to no difference in percentage weight change in the long term (2 studies, 1262 people). In the medium term, people taking liraglutide might experience more unwanted effects of any kind (16 studies, 8147 people) and more serious unwanted effects (20 studies, 8487 people) than those taking placebo. We are unsure about mild-to-moderate unwanted effects (17 studies, 7440 people) or whether unwanted effects caused people to stop treatment (19 studies, 8628 people). In the long term (2 studies, 2640 participants), liraglutide may increase unwanted effects and people may be more likely to stop treatment because of them. We are unsure about unwanted events overall and mild-to-moderate unwanted effects. Liraglutide probably makes little or no difference to quality of life both in the medium term (6 studies, 3733 people) and in the long term (1 study, 863 people). Liraglutide probably makes little or no difference to major cardiovascular events in the medium term (6 studies, 5762 people). We are unsure about its effects on major cardiovascular events in the long term and on deaths in the medium and long term. We are moderately confident that people taking liraglutide lose more weight than those taking placebo. However, our confidence in the other evidence is limited because of how the studies were conducted and information that was missing. Few studies looked at long-term effects or included different people from different places, so the results may not apply to everyone. The manufacturers of liraglutide were involved in the design, conduct or analysis of 22 of the 24 studies, which limits our confidence in the results.

5eceed79840590300f53fa51,interactive_4,What are the benefits and risks of eye drops that widen the pupil as an additional treatment for inflammation after a blow to the eye?,"Traumatic eye complaints account for 3% of all hospital emergency department visits. The most common traumatic injury to the eye is blunt trauma, which accounts for 30% of these visits. Blunt trauma frequently leads to traumatic iridocyclitis, thus causing anterior uveitis. Iridocyclitis frequently causes tearing, photophobia, eye pain, and vision loss. These symptoms are a result of the inflammatory processes and ciliary spasms to iris muscles and sphincter. The inflammatory process is usually managed with topical corticosteroids, while the ciliary spasm is blunted by dilating the pupils with topical mydriatic agents, an adjuvant therapy. However, the effectiveness of mydriatic agents has not been quantified in terms of reduction of ocular pain and visual acuity loss.
To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of topical mydriatics as adjunctive therapy to topical corticosteroids for traumatic iridocyclitis.
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register (2019, issue 6); Ovid MEDLINE; Embase.com; Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) Plus; PubMed; ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic search for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 12 June 2019.
We planned to include randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared topical mydriatic agents in conjunction with topical corticosteroid therapy versus topical corticosteroids alone, in participants with traumatic iridocyclitis.
Two review authors (JH, MK) independently screened titles and abstracts, then full-text reports, against eligibility criteria. We planned to have two authors independently extract data from included studies. We resolved differences in opinion by discussion.
There were no eligible RCTs that compared the interventions of interest in people with traumatic iridocyclitis.
We did not find any evidence from RCTs about the efficacy of topical mydriatic agents as an adjunctive therapy with topical corticosteroids for treating traumatic iridocyclitis. In the absence of these types of studies, we cannot draw any firm conclusions. Controlled trials that compare the combined use of topical mydriatic agents and corticosteroid drops against standard corticosteroid drops alone, in people with traumatic iridocyclitis are required. These may provide evidence about the efficacy and risk of topical mydriatic drops as adjuvant therapy for traumatic iridocyclitis.","Hospital emergency departments often treat people with eye injuries. There are two main types of eye injuries: blunt trauma injuries, when an object or force strikes the eye, commonly caused by motor vehicle accidents, sports- or work-related accidents, or fights; and penetrating trauma injuries, when a sharp object or an object traveling at high speed (for example, pellets from air-powered guns) pierces the eye. Blunt trauma is the more common type of injury. People who experience these injuries often develop traumatic iridocyclitis, an inflammation of the iris (the colored part of the eye surrounding the pupil) and the ciliary body (the muscles and tissues around the iris). Traumatic iridocyclitis can develop after both major and minor blunt trauma and can affect both children and adults. Symptoms include eye pain and sensitivity to light. If the inflammation is missed or not treated properly, it can lead to vision loss. The standard treatment for traumatic iridocyclitis is anti-inflammatory eye drops (corticosteroids). Eye drops that widen the pupil (mydriatics) are often added to reduce pain and discomfort and to shorten the duration of symptoms. We aimed to determine whether using mydriatics alongside corticosteroids is more beneficial or causes more unwanted effects than using corticosteroids alone. Specifically, we wanted to know if mydriatics relieve pain and inflammation and improve vision, and whether they cause complications such as chronic pain or serious harm to vision, including blindness. Our team searched the medical literature for randomized controlled trials the most reliable type of study on people of any age with traumatic iridocyclitis that compared mydriatics plus corticosteroids against corticosteroids alone. We found no randomized controlled trials addressing this question. Therefore, we do not know whether adding mydriatics to corticosteroids is helpful or harmful compared with corticosteroids alone. More research is needed, including well-designed trials, to understand the benefits and risks of using mydriatics as an additional treatment for traumatic iridocyclitis.",1053,Topical mydriatic agents; Topical corticosteroids; Traumatic iridocyclitis; Blunt trauma; Anterior uveitis; Ciliary spasms; Photophobia; Inflammatory processes; Adjunctive therapy; Ocular pain,How might the lack of randomized controlled trials affect the implementation of mydriatic agents in clinical practice for traumatic iridocyclitis?,What is the intended benefit of adding mydriatics to corticosteroid treatment for traumatic iridocyclitis?,Select the items that are animals,Describe the condition known as traumatic iridocyclitis.,What standard treatment is used for traumatic iridocyclitis?,"Clinicians may hesitate to use mydriatics due to unclear benefits and risks.; Clinicians can confidently prescribe mydriatics, assuming they're safe.; Clinicians should replace corticosteroids with mydriatics alone.",Clinicians may hesitate to use mydriatics due to unclear benefits and risks.,To relieve pain and improve vision; To reduce allergic reactions; To prevent infection,To relieve pain and improve vision,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,An inflammation of the iris and ciliary body; A breakdown of the retina; A swelling of the cornea,An inflammation of the iris and ciliary body,Anti-inflammatory eye drops (corticosteroids); Antibiotic ointments; Laser eye surgery,Anti-inflammatory eye drops (corticosteroids)
5eceed79840590300f53fa51,interactive_4,Is semaglutide an effective weight-loss treatment for adults living with obesity and does it cause unwanted effects?,"To assess the effects of semaglutide on adults living with obesity. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and two trials registries. The latest search date was 17 December 2024.
Semaglutide results in a clinically relevant weight loss at medium-term follow-up compared to placebo, which is likely to be sustained in the long term, while taking the drug. While semaglutide increases the risk of adverse events leading to withdrawal, it appears to be of limited clinical relevance in absolute terms at medium-term, and clinically relevant at long-term follow-up. The effects of semaglutide on quality of life, MACE, and mortality are likely limited or uncertain. Most studies were funded by the drug's manufacturer, raising important concerns about conflicts of interest. We identified 46 ongoing studies that may strengthen future evidence syntheses. Further independent studies are needed, particularly in underrepresented populations, to better understand the broader effects of semaglutide in the management of obesity.
This Cochrane review was funded by the World Health Organization (WHO).
Original protocol (10.1002/14651858.CD015092) published in September 2022. The modifications to the original protocol were prospectively registered in PROSPERO (CRD420250654193) in February 2025.","Obesity is a long-term condition in which a person has too much body fat. It can increase the risk of health problems like type 2 diabetes, diseases of the heart and blood vessels (cardiovascular disease), and some types of cancer. Obesity levels are increasing worldwide, placing a large burden on healthcare systems. Managing obesity often involves lifestyle changes such as eating a healthier diet and being more physically active. However, many people find these changes difficult to maintain, and doctors may prescribe medication to support weight loss. Semaglutide is a medication that mimics a natural gut hormone. It reduces appetite, helping people to lose weight. It can be given as an injection or swallowed. Some people taking semaglutide experience unwanted effects, such as feeling or being sick, diarrhoea and indigestion. Similar medications include liraglutide and tirzepatide. We wanted to know how well semaglutide works in adults with obesity in the medium term (6 to 24 months) and long term (24 months or more). We examined its effects on weight loss, unwanted effects, health problems associated with obesity, quality of life, and risk of death. We did not look at what happens after people stop taking semaglutide. We searched for studies that compared semaglutide with a placebo (a sham medication), lifestyle changes or another weight-loss medication for people living with obesity. We compared and analysed the results, and assessed our confidence in the evidence. We included 18 studies with 27,949 men and women, aged 41 to 69 years, who took semaglutide for between 6 months and 4 years or longer. The studies mainly took place in upper-middle- or high-income countries, and mostly included White and Asian people. They compared semaglutide with placebo, liraglutide and tirzepatide. The main comparison with placebo has the following findings. In the medium term (16 studies, 10,041 people): semaglutide leads to more weight loss as a percentage of body weight, and to more people losing 5% of their body weight than placebo. People may experience mild-to-moderate unwanted effects with semaglutide, but these unwanted effects probably make little or no difference to people deciding to stop treatment. The effects of semaglutide on serious unwanted effects are unclear. Semaglutide likely makes little or no difference to quality of life and may not significantly reduce major cardiovascular events or deaths. In the long term (2 studies, 17,908 people): weight loss probably continues with semaglutide as a percentage of body weight and in the number of people who lose 5% of their body weight. Semaglutide probably makes little to no difference to serious unwanted effects, and we are unsure about its effects on mild-to-moderate unwanted effects. However, these unwanted effects probably make more people decide to stop treatment. Semaglutide likely makes little or no difference to quality of life, major cardiovascular events or death. We are very confident that people taking semaglutide lose more weight than those taking placebo. However, semaglutide's manufacturer was involved in most of the studies, so our confidence in the results is limited. Study locations and participants were quite similar, so we don't know how semaglutide works for people from different backgrounds and places.",1099,semaglutide; withdrawal; medium-term follow-up; long-term follow-up; quality of life; mortality; evidence syntheses; underrepresented populations; management of obesity,What are the implications of the study's limited participant diversity on its findings?,In what ways might further independent studies contribute to the understanding of semaglutide's role in obesity management?,Select all of the following that are fruits,Describe the main comparison made in the semaglutide studies.,Explain the effects of semaglutide on weight loss according to the studies.,It restricts the applicability of results to diverse populations.; It validates the findings for all ethnic groups.; It highlights the need for additional research in diverse settings.,It restricts the applicability of results to diverse populations.; It highlights the need for additional research in diverse settings.,They can provide insights into long-term side effects.; They could eliminate all medication risks.; They might enhance understanding for underrepresented populations.,They can provide insights into long-term side effects.; They might enhance understanding for underrepresented populations.,dog; blue; grape,grape,Semaglutide was compared with a placebo; Semaglutide was compared with vitamin supplements; Semaglutide was compared with physical therapy,Semaglutide was compared with a placebo,Semaglutide leads to more weight loss than placebo; Semaglutide has no effect on weight loss; Semaglutide causes weight gain,Semaglutide leads to more weight loss than placebo
5eceed79840590300f53fa51,finetuned_5,"Thymic peptides for treatment of cancer patients in addition to chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or both","Purified thymus extracts (pTE) and synthetic thymic peptides (sTP) are thought to enhance the immune system of cancer patients to help fight tumour growth and reduce infections caused by disease-related or treatment-related immunosuppression. This review evaluated the effectiveness of pTE and sTP for cancer management. Researchers searched major medical databases up to February 2010 for randomized trials in adult cancer patients where pTE or sTP were added to chemotherapy or radiotherapy and compared with the same regimen alone or with placebo. Data were independently extracted by two authors, and odds ratios were calculated for overall survival, disease-free survival, tumour response, and adverse effects. A random-effects model was used. Twenty-six trials involving 2736 patients were identified: 20 trials investigated pTE (thymostimulin or thymosin fraction 5) and six investigated sTP (thymopentin or thymosin ?1). Twenty-one trials reported overall survival, six reported disease-free survival, 14 reported tumour response, nine reported adverse effects, and 10 reported safety. Adding pTE showed no benefit for overall survival (RR 1.00), disease-free survival (RR 0.97), or tumour response (RR 1.07), with moderate to high heterogeneity. For thymosin ?1, the pooled RR for overall survival was 1.21 and for disease-free survival was 3.37, though neither result reached statistical significance. pTE reduced the risk of severe infectious complications (RR 0.54), and thymostimulin showed a non-significant trend toward reduced severe neutropenia. Both pTE and sTP were generally well tolerated. Many trials had at least moderate risk of bias. Overall, there is no clear evidence that adding pTE to cancer treatment improves survival or tumour response, although thymosin ?1 showed a possible trend toward benefit. There is preliminary evidence that pTE may reduce severe infectious complications during chemotherapy or radiotherapy.","The immune system plays a key role in the body's own defences against cancer cells. The thymus gland plays a central part in this and modifies T-cells, a subset of lymphocytes. Studies with thymic peptides have shown a variety of effects on the immune system. There are two groups of thymic peptides available for use in treatment: purified extracts from animal (mostly calf) thymus glands and synthetically produced thymus gland peptides.
This review aims to answer the question whether having thymic peptides can improve the response to and tolerability of standard chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or combined treatment. Further questions are whether the peptides inhibit or reduce the progression and recurrence of disease, whether they prolong the life of cancer patients and whether quality of life is improved. This review looked at the evidence from 26 clinical trials with a total of 2736 adult cancer patients. Many of the trials were small and of moderate quality. Only three studies were less than 10 years old. Thymosin ?1 is a synthetic peptide that shows some promise as a treatment option for patients with metastatic melanoma when used in addition to chemotherapy. Severe problems occur during chemotherapy and radiotherapy due to low white blood cell counts and infections. These were reduced by using purified thymus extracts. However, the use of purified thymus extracts should be investigated more thoroughly before the extracts are used routinely in patients. The findings were not conclusive and caution is advised.

We identified all relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) by searching the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, Science Citation Index Expanded, the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Literature on Coronavirus Disease database, and the COVID Network Meta-Analysis database with no language restrictions up to 26 April 2024. In outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19, molnupiravir 800 mg taken orally every 12 hours for five days probably results in little to no difference in all-cause mortality and may result in little to no difference in rates of hospitalisation and symptom resolution. There is evidence of increased viral clearance by day 5, but the clinical relevance of this finding is unclear. There is probably little to no difference in adverse events, and there is little to no difference in serious adverse events, with molnupiravir versus placebo or standard care. Inpatient data are lacking, and there is no evidence of benefit of molnupiravir in this population. Further research involving inpatients may change this.","Molnupiravir is a pill used to treat COVID-19 in people who are at high risk of developing severe illness. It works by interfering with the ability of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) to reproduce, helping the body to fight off the infection. We wanted to find out how molnupiravir compares to no treatment, placebo (dummy treatment), or standard of care in decreasing death and hospitalisation in people with COVID-19; speeding up recovery (time to symptom resolution); clearing the virus that causes COVID-19 (viral clearance); safety, by looking at all unwanted events and serious unwanted events. We searched for studies that evaluated molnupiravir compared with no treatment, placebo, or standard of care in people with confirmed COVID-19. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods. The types of studies we looked at were randomised controlled trials, which assign people randomly to two or more treatment groups. This is the best way to ensure that study groups are similar, and that investigators and participants don't know who is in which group. The review included 11 studies with 31,272 participants, mostly outpatients (people not admitted to hospital) with mild to moderate COVID-19. When we combined results from studies that recruited outpatients (people not admitted to hospital) with mild to moderate COVID-19, we found the following key results: Molnupiravir probably results in little to no difference in the risk of death. Compared with people receiving placebo or standard of care, between four and 10 fewer people receiving molnupiravir will die within one month for every 10,000 people treated. We considered this reduction clinically insignificant. Molnupiravir may not reduce hospitalisations, meaning it may not prevent people from getting sicker or needing hospital care. There was evidence of increased viral clearance with molnupiravir by day 5, but this effect diminished by day 14, and we are not sure if it makes any real difference for patients. Molnupiravir may have little to no effect on the probability of having no symptoms by day 14 or day 28. Molnupiravir probably results in little to no difference in adverse events, and results in little to no difference in serious adverse events. There are too few data to draw clear conclusions about molnupiravir's effects in people admitted to hospital with severe COVID-19. Most evidence comes from studies conducted in outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19, so the results may not apply to people with severe illness who are hospitalised. The studies provided scarce evidence on long-term outcomes such as quality of life after recovery or how long the virus stays in the body.

GLP-1 is an incretin, a gastrointestinal hormone that is released into the circulation in response to ingested nutrients. GLP-1 regulates glucose levels by stimulating glucose-dependent insulin secretion and biosynthesis, and by suppressing glucagon secretion, delayed gastric emptying and promoting satiety.
To assess the effects of glucagon-like peptide analogues in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Studies were obtained from electronic searches of The Cochrane Library (last search issue 1, 2011), MEDLINE (last search March 2011), EMBASE (last search March 2011), Web of Science (last search March 2011) and databases of ongoing trials.
Studies were included if they were randomised controlled trials of a minimum duration of eight weeks comparing a GLP-1 analogue with placebo, insulin, an oral anti-diabetic agent, or another GLP-1 analogue in people with type 2 diabetes.
Data extraction and quality assessment of studies were done by one reviewer and checked by a second. Data were analysed by type of GLP-1 agonist and comparison treatment. Where appropriate, data were summarised in a meta-analysis (mean differences and risk ratios summarised using a random-effects model).
Seventeen randomised controlled trials including relevant analyses for 6899 participants were included in the analysis. Studies were mostly of short duration, usually 26 weeks. In comparison with placebo, all GLP-1 agonists reduced glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels by about 1%. Exenatide 2 mg once weekly and liraglutide 1.8 mg reduced it by 0.20% and 0.24% respectively more than insulin glargine. Exenatide 2 mg once weekly reduced HbA1c more than exenatide 10 ?g twice daily, sitagliptin and pioglitazone. Liraglutide 1.8 mg reduced HbA1c by 0.33% more than exenatide 10 ?g twice daily. Liraglutide led to similar improvements in HbA1c compared to sulphonylureas but reduced it more than sitagliptin and rosiglitazone. Both exenatide and liraglutide led to greater weight loss than most active comparators, including in participants not experiencing nausea. Hypoglycaemia occurred more frequently in participants taking concomitant sulphonylurea. GLP-1 agonists caused gastrointestinal adverse effects, mainly nausea. These adverse events were strongest at the beginning and then subsided. Beta-cell function was improved with GLP-1 agonists but the effect did not persist after cessation of treatment. None of the studies was long enough to assess long-term positive or negative effects.
GLP-1 agonists are effective in improving glycaemic control.","Glucagon-like peptide analogues or agonists are a new kind of drug in the treatment of type 2 diabetes that are given by injection under the skin. They regulate glucose levels by stimulating glucose-dependent insulin secretion and biosynthesis, and by suppressing glucagon secretion, delaying gastric emptying and promoting satiety. Various glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists are in use or in the licensing process, including exenatide, liraglutide, albiglutide, taspoglutide, lixisenatide and LY2189265.
Seventeen randomised controlled trials of mostly moderate to high quality randomised approximately 6899 people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Studies were mostly of short duration, usually 26 weeks. The longest duration study was 30 weeks. Of the seventeen studies, one compared albiglutide with placebo, two compared exenatide 10µg twice daily against exenatide 2 mg once weekly, one compared exenatide 2 mg once weekly against insulin glargine, one compared exenatide 2 mg once weekly against pioglitazone and sitagliptin, five compared liraglutide with placebo, two compared liraglutide with sulphonylurea, one each compared exenatide twice daily with liraglutide, liraglutide with sitagliptin, liraglutide with rosiglitazone and liraglutide with insulin glargine, two compared taspoglutide with placebo and one each compared lixisenatide with placebo and LY2189265 with placebo. In people already treated with oral anti-diabetes drugs, addition of glucagon-like peptide analogues improved blood sugar control in comparison to placebo, rosiglitazone, pioglitazone or sitagliptin, but not always in comparison to insulin (for exenatide) or glimepiride (a sulphonylurea). Glucagon-like peptide analogous caused more weight loss than any of the comparison treatments. However, more nausea and other gastrointestinal effects such as diarrhoea or vomiting were seen, though these tended to wear off and were not seen in all participants. There was slightly more hypoglycaemia with glucagon-like analogous than with placebo, but generally less than with other anti-diabetic treatments.

695ff06044ca743d0c309f99,static_1,How accurate are alternative laboratory-based molecular tests (to RT-PCR with prior RNA extraction/purification) for identifying people infected by SARS-CoV-2?,"Diagnosing people with a SARS-CoV-2 infection played a critical role in managing the COVID-19 pandemic and remains a priority for the transition to long-term management of COVID-19. Initial shortages of extraction and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) reagents impaired the desired upscaling of testing in many countries, which led to the search for alternatives to RNA extraction/purification and RT-PCR testing. Reference standard methods for diagnosing the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection rely primarily on real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Alternatives to RT-PCR could, if sufficiently accurate, have a positive impact by expanding the range of diagnostic tools available for the timely identification of people infected by SARS-CoV-2, access to testing and the use of resources. We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of alternative (to RT-PCR assays) laboratory-based molecular tests for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection. We searched the COVID-19 Open Access Project living evidence database from the University of Bern until 30 September 2020 and the WHO COVID-19 Research Database until 31 October 2022, with no language restrictions. We included studies of people with suspected or known SARS-CoV-2 infection, or where tests were used to screen for infection, and studies evaluating commercially developed laboratory-based molecular tests for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection considered as alternatives to RT-PCR testing, and we included all reference standards to define the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2, including RT-PCR tests and established clinical diagnostic criteria. Two authors independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and applicability using the QUADAS-2 tool. We presented sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals for each test using paired forest plots and summarised results using average sensitivity and specificity with a bivariate random-effects meta-analysis, illustrating the findings per index test category and assay brand compared to the WHO's acceptable sensitivity and specificity thresholds for nucleic acid tests. We included data from 64 studies reporting 94 cohorts of participants and 105 index test evaluations, with 74,753 samples and 7517 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases. We did not identify any published or preprint reports of accuracy for a considerable number of commercially produced NAAT assays. Most cohorts were judged at unclear or high risk of bias in more than three QUADAS-2 domains; around half were at high risk of selection bias because of recruitment based on COVID status; and three quarters were at high risk of bias in the reference standard domain due to reliance on a single RT-PCR result or unclear diagnostic timing, missing results, or absent participant flow diagrams. For test categories with four or more evaluations allowing summary estimates, RT-PCR assays designed to omit/adapt RNA extraction/purification had average sensitivity of 95.1% (95% CI 91.1% to 97.3%) and specificity of 99.7% (95% CI 98.5% to 99.9%; 27 evaluations, 2834 samples and 1178 cases); RT-LAMP assays had average sensitivity of 88.4% (95% CI 83.1% to 92.2%) and specificity of 99.7% (95% CI 98.7% to 99.9%; 24 evaluations, 29,496 samples and 2255 cases); TMA assays had average sensitivity of 97.6% (95% CI 95.2% to 98.8%) and specificity of 99.4% (95% CI 94.9% to 99.9%; 14 evaluations, 2196 samples and 942 cases); digital PCR assays had average sensitivity of 98.5% (95% CI 95.2% to 99.5%) and specificity of 91.4% (95% CI 60.4% to 98.7%; 5 evaluations, 703 samples and 354 cases); RT-LAMP assays omitting/adapting RNA extraction had average sensitivity of 73.1% (95% CI 58.4% to 84%) and specificity of 100% (95% CI 98% to 100%; 24 evaluations, 14,342 samples and 1502 cases). Only two index categories fulfilled WHO-acceptable requirements: RT-PCR assays designed to omit/adapt RNA extraction/purification and TMA assays. At 5% prevalence in a cohort of 1000 people, the positive predictive value of RT-PCR assays omitting/adapting extraction is 94%, with three false positives among 51 positive results and about two missed cases; for TMA assays, positive predictive value is 89%, with six false positives among 55 positive results and around one missed case. Alternative laboratory-based molecular tests aim to enhance testing capacity by reducing time, steps, and resource requirements. Several technologies with potential advantages have not been evaluated or were assessed by few low-quality studies, so performance remains undetermined. Only RT-PCR assays designed to omit/adapt RNA extraction/purification and TMA assays fulfil WHO accuracy standards and may be suitable alternatives when RT-PCR is inaccessible. However, findings must be interpreted with caution due to limitations, including reliance on retrospective samples without symptom information, dominant representation of specific high-performing brands (21/26 and 12/14 studies), and methodological weaknesses. Although we used comprehensive searches and broad inclusion criteria, further research is needed to evaluate alternative COVID-19 tests and their role in pandemic management.","Laboratory-based molecular assays (tests) aim to confirm or rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection in people. Alternatives to RT-PCR assays have been developed to minimise the steps needed to process samples in the laboratory or use fewer resources to obtain the same valid results. For this review, we focus on tests commercially developed by a manufacturer, providing instructions for their professional use. People with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection should know if they are infected to self-isolate, receive treatment, and inform close contacts. Failure to detect SARS-CoV-2 when it is present risks spreading infection and results in missed opportunities for prevention. Diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection when it is not present may lead to unnecessary self-isolation and testing of close contacts. Currently, testing to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection relies on a laboratory molecular test called RT-PCR. This requires specialist equipment and can take 24 hours to produce a result. If assays that take less time or use readily available resources were sufficiently accurate to replace RT-PCR testing, this could increase the number of tests that could be done, allow faster diagnosis and enable people to take appropriate action more quickly. We wanted to know whether commercially developed, alternative laboratory-based molecular tests are accurate enough to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to RT-PCR. We looked for studies investigating these tests in people (or samples) that were also tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection using RT-PCR which modified RT-PCR by removing or altering components of this testing process. We included 105 evaluations evaluating alternatives to RT-PCR in the review. The main results are based on 74,753 samples, and SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed in 7517 of these samples. Most evaluations (27/105) concerned various test types specifically designed to omit/adapt RNA extraction/purification. Twenty-four of 105 evaluations concerned various test types operating at one temperature (isothermal tests) rather than cycling through different temperatures. Twenty-four of 105 evaluations were concerned with various test types that combined these two alternative approaches. Only tests specifically designed to omit/adapt RNA extraction/purification and TMA assays with RNA extraction (a type of isothermal test) met WHO-acceptable standards for confirming and ruling out SARS-CoV-2. For illustration, the results of these studies indicate that in a group of 1000 people, 50 of whom (5%) actually have SARS-CoV-2: for tests specifically designed to omit/adapt RNA extraction/purification, 51 people would test positive for SARS-CoV-2, of these, three people (6%) would not have SARS-CoV-2 (false-positive result), and 949 people would test negative for SARS-CoV-2, of these, two people (0.2%) would actually have SARS-CoV-2 (false-negative result); for TMA tests with RNA extraction, 55 people would test positive for SARS-CoV-2, of these, six people (10%) would not have SARS-CoV-2 (false-positive result), and 945 people would test negative for SARS-CoV-2, of these, one person (0.1%) would actually have SARS-CoV-2 (false-negative result). Most included studies did not provide information on participants who underwent testing, such as whether they had symptoms or were close contacts of a SARS-CoV-2 case. We also had concerns about the method of recruiting participants for the majority of included studies, which may have resulted in an overestimation of the accuracy of these methods. In addition, the method used to determine whether individuals did not have SARS-CoV-2 infection was not considered reliable for most studies, which may have resulted in underestimating the accuracy of these methods. Some studies did not follow the manufacturers' instructions for using the test. Results from different test brands using the same technique varied. The studies included in this review suggest that two laboratory-based molecular tests might be accurate enough to replace or supplement RT-PCR tests with prior RNA extraction/purification for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection: RT-PCR tests developed to omit or adapt RNA extraction or purification and TMA isothermal tests (retaining an RNA extraction step). Other alternative tests to RT-PCR were assessed just by a few studies of limited methodological quality, and their performance should be evaluated by additional studies. Furthermore, data in these studies mostly relied on samples acquired in the past (compared to current or future samples), thus further evaluation of these tests in real clinical practice scenarios is required. Also, decisions on the optimal test for a specific setting will be driven not only by diagnostic accuracy, but also by other factors such as test complexity, time to result, acceptability to those being tested, and the setting in which the tests are to be used.",1112,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
695ff06044ca743d0c309f99,static_2,Heart surgery for aortic valve replacement through a small incision versus the standard full incision at the front of the chest,"Aortic valve disease is a common condition easily treatable with cardiac surgery. This is conventionally performed by opening the sternum ('median sternotomy') and replacing the valve under cardiopulmonary bypass. Median sternotomy is well tolerated, but as less invasive options become available, the efficacy of limited incisions has been called into question. In particular, the effects of reducing the visibility and surgical access have raised safety concerns with regard to the placement of cannulae, venting of the heart, epicardial wire placement, and de-airing of the heart at the end of the procedure. These difficulties may increase operating times, affecting outcome. The benefits of smaller incisions are thought to include decreased pain; improved respiratory mechanics; reductions in wound infections, bleeding, and need for transfusion; shorter intensive care stay; better cosmesis; and a quicker return to normal activity. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2017, with seven new studies.
To assess the effects of minimally invasive aortic valve replacement via a limited sternotomy versus conventional aortic valve replacement via median sternotomy in people with aortic valve disease requiring surgical replacement.
We performed searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase from inception to August 2021, with no language limitations. We also searched two clinical trials registries and manufacturers' websites. We reviewed references of primary studies to identify any further studies of relevance.
We included randomised controlled trials comparing aortic valve replacement via a median sternotomy versus aortic valve replacement via a limited sternotomy. We excluded trials that performed other minimally invasive incisions such as mini-thoracotomies, port access, transapical, transfemoral or robotic procedures. Although some well-conducted prospective and retrospective case-control and cohort studies exist, these were not included in this review.
Two review authors independently assessed trial papers to extract data, assess quality, and identify risk of bias. A third review author provided arbitration where required. We determined the certainty of evidence using the GRADE methodology and summarised results of patient-relevant outcomes in a summary of findings table.
The review included 14 trials with 1395 participants. Most studies had at least two domains at high risk of bias. We analysed 14 outcomes investigating the effects of minimally invasive limited upper hemi-sternotomy on aortic valve replacement as compared to surgery performed via full median sternotomy. Upper hemi-sternotomy may have little to no effect on mortality versus full median sternotomy (risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45 to 1.94; 10 studies, 985 participants; low-certainty evidence). Upper hemi-sternotomy for aortic valve replacement may increase cardiopulmonary bypass time slightly, although the evidence is very uncertain (mean difference (MD) 10.63 minutes, 95% CI 3.39 to 17.88; 10 studies, 1043 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and may increase aortic cross-clamp time slightly (MD 6.07 minutes, 95% CI 0.79 to 11.35; 12 studies, 1235 participants; very low-certainty evidence), although the evidence is very uncertain. Most studies had at least two domains at high risk of bias. Postoperative blood loss was probably lower in the upper hemi-sternotomy group (MD -153 mL, 95% CI -246 to -60; 8 studies, 767 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Low-certainty evidence suggested that there may be no change in pain scores by upper hemi-sternotomy (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.19, 95% CI -0.43 to 0.04; 5 studies, 649 participants). Upper hemi-sternotomy may result in little to no difference in quality of life (MD 0.03 higher, 95% CI 0 to 0.06 higher; 4 studies, 624 participants; low-certainty evidence). Two studies reporting index admission costs concluded that limited sternotomy may be more costly at index admission in the UK National Health Service (MD 1190 GBP more, 95% CI 420 GBP to 1970 GBP, 2 studies, 492 participants; low-certainty evidence).
The evidence was of very low to moderate certainty. Sample sizes were small and underpowered to demonstrate differences in some outcomes. Clinical heterogeneity was also noted. Considering these limitations, there may be little to no effect on mortality. Differences in extracorporeal support times are uncertain, comparing upper hemi-sternotomy to full sternotomy for aortic valve replacement. Before widespread adoption of the minimally invasive approach can be recommended, there is a need for a well-designed and adequately powered prospective randomised controlled trial. Such a study would benefit from also performing a robust cost analysis. Growing patient preference for minimally invasive techniques merits thorough quality of life analyses to be included as end points, as well as quantitative measures of physiological reserve.","Aortic valve replacement is a common operation performed to replace one of the valves of the heart. The reasons for needing this include valves that do not open properly or do not close properly, which can happen with ageing. People with aortic valve disease can experience chest pain, breathlessness, collapse or sudden death.
The most common way of performing the operation is by opening the whole length of the breastbone. Another method involves a smaller 'keyhole'-type cut that only divides a small part of the breastbone. Doing it this way makes the scar smaller, but can also make the operation more challenging because it is more difficult to see and reach the heart. This might make the operation longer and less safe, even though it looks smaller from the outside.
We wanted to find out if the smaller 'keyhole'-type cut (limited sternotomy) was better than the usual full cut down the breastbone (full sternotomy) when performing aortic valve replacement surgery in adults. We wanted to see if both were as safe and effective as each other.
We updated a review that we had previously written on the topic. We searched for studies that compared limited sternotomy with full sternotomy in adults undergoing aortic valve replacement. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as the study methods and sizes.
We found 14 studies with 1395 participants from Europe, Russia, and North Africa. There was a mixture of different conditions needing aortic valve replacement. Most of these people were 60 to 70 years old and approximately half were male. The participants in each group were similar.
There may be no difference between the groups in the number of people who died as a result of having surgery. If 25 out of every 1000 people who had the full-size cut in their breastbone died after the operation, around 23 (somewhere between 11 and 48) in every 1000 would die using the 'keyhole' operation. Because that range goes from two times less to two times more, it is difficult to say whether the operation is definitely better or worse.
The amount of time that surgeons needed to use a heart-lung machine to support the heart while doing the 'keyhole' operation may have been on average around 11 minutes longer - not a large amount. The amount of time that the heart was completely stopped to do the 'keyhole' operation may be six minutes longer on average, though we were not confident in the evidence.
None of the important problems that occur after heart surgery were more common in either group (infections around the heart, irregular heart rhythms or the need for an urgent reoperation because of bleeding), although again it was uncertain if the evidence was robust enough. Participants probably bled slightly less after having minimally invasive surgery. In the operation with the smaller cut, the average blood loss was 153 mL less. There may be no change in pain and quality of life may not have been any different between the two groups.
Limited sternotomy possibly costs more per operation to perform, by about 1190 pounds sterling.
We were not very confident in the evidence. One of the main problems with the studies was that they were small and may not have picked up subtle differences between the groups. Because problems after heart surgery are rare, we need to assess lots of people having operations in order to spot small changes. Another problem is that surgeons tend to have lots of slightly different ways in which they do operations. There were also differences in practice, meaning that measurements might not have been taken at the same time, in the same way. We need to be careful about making conclusions about which differences in the groups in this review were due to the smaller incision and which were due to these other factors.

695ff06044ca743d0c309f99,static_2,Acetylcysteine and carbocysteine to treat acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections in children without chronic broncho-pulmonary disease,"Acetylcysteine and carbocysteine are the most commonly prescribed mucolytic drugs in Brazil and many European and African countries. To our knowledge, no systematic review has been published on their efficacy and safety for acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections (RTIs) in children without chronic broncho-pulmonary disease. The objective was to assess the efficacy and safety and to establish a benefit-risk ratio of acetylcysteine and carbocysteine as symptomatic treatments for acute upper and lower RTIs in paediatric patients without chronic broncho-pulmonary disease. We searched CENTRAL (2013, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 to February week 3, 2013), EMBASE (1980 to March 2013), Micromedex (2010), Pascal (1987 to 2004) and Science Citation Index (1974 to March 2013). To study efficacy, we used randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the use of acetylcysteine or carbocysteine versus placebo, either alone or as an add-on therapy. To study safety, we used trials comparing acetylcysteine or carbocysteine versus active treatment or no treatment and case reports. In this review update two review authors (YD, MC), with help from a colleague, extracted data and assessed trial quality. We performed a subgroup analysis of children younger than two years of age. We included six trials involving 497 participants to study efficacy. They showed some benefit (e.g. reduction of cough at day seven) from mucolytic agents, although differences were of little clinical relevance. No conclusion was drawn about the subgroup of infants younger than two years because data were unavailable. Thirty-four studies, including the previous six trials involving 2064 children, were eligible to study safety. Overall safety was good but very few data were available to evaluate safety in infants younger than two years. However, 59 cases of paradoxically increased bronchorrhoea observed in infants were reported to the French pharmacovigilance system. The results have to be interpreted with caution because they are based on a limited number of participants included in studies whose methodological quality is questionable. Acetylcysteine and carbocysteine seem to have a limited efficacy and appear to be safe in children older than two years. These results should take into consideration the fact that acetylcysteine and carbocysteine are prescribed for self limiting diseases (for example, acute cough, bronchitis). Given strong concerns about safety, these drugs should only be used for acute upper and lower RTIs in the context of a RCT with regards to children younger than two years.","Acetylcysteine and carbocysteine are the most commonly prescribed drugs intended to modify the structure of bronchial secretions. This systematic review evaluated their efficacy and safety for treating acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections in children without chronic broncho-pulmonary disease, with particular attention to children younger than two years of age. Forty-nine trials met the inclusion criteria. Six trials involving 497 participants were used to assess efficacy, comparing acetylcysteine or carbocysteine with placebo. Thirty-four trials, including those six, were eligible to assess safety and involved 2064 paediatric patients. The results suggest that acetylcysteine and carbocysteine have real but limited efficacy, such as reducing cough by day seven, and appear generally safe aside from rare mild gastrointestinal side effects in children older than two years. However, these conclusions are limited by the small number of participants and questionable methodological quality. Their use should also be considered in light of the fact that these drugs are prescribed for self-limiting illnesses such as acute cough and bronchitis. In children younger than two years, due to strong concerns about safety including the possibility of increased rather than decreased bronchial secretions these drugs should only be used for acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections within the context of a randomized controlled trial.",1075,mucolytic drugs; acetylcysteine; carbocysteine; respiratory tract infections; chronic broncho-pulmonary disease; add-on therapy; pharmacovigilance system; bronchorrhoea; clinical relevance; symptomatic treatments,What was the primary objective of the systematic review on acetylcysteine and carbocysteine in children?,Which age group was given particular attention in the study of acetylcysteine and carbocysteine?,Select all of the following that are colors,"According to the summary, what is a noted effect of acetylcysteine and carbocysteine in children older than two years?",Why should acetylcysteine and carbocysteine only be used in children under two years in a controlled trial?,To assess the safety and efficacy for acute RTIs; To study their long-term impact on chronic diseases; To compare them with antibiotics,To assess the safety and efficacy for acute RTIs,Children older than two years; Children younger than two years; Adolescents,Children younger than two years,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Significant reduction of fever; Limited efficacy with mild gastrointestinal side effects; Complete resolution of respiratory infections,Limited efficacy with mild gastrointestinal side effects,Due to strong concerns about safety; They are ineffective in this age group; They have severe side effects in older children,Due to strong concerns about safety
695ff06044ca743d0c309f99,interactive_3,Are anti-blood clotting drugs beneficial for people with chronic kidney disease?,"Antiplatelet agents are widely used to prevent cardiovascular events. The risks and benefits of antiplatelet agents may be different in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) for whom occlusive atherosclerotic events are less prevalent, and bleeding hazards might be increased. This is an update of a review first published in 2013. To evaluate the benefits and harms of antiplatelet agents in people with any form of CKD, including those with CKD not receiving renal replacement therapy, patients receiving any form of dialysis, and kidney transplant recipients. We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 13 July 2021 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. We selected randomised controlled trials of any antiplatelet agents versus placebo or no treatment, or direct head-to-head antiplatelet agent studies in people with CKD. Studies were included if they enrolled participants with CKD, or included people in broader at-risk populations in which data for subgroups with CKD could be disaggregated. Four authors independently extracted data from primary study reports and any available supplementary information for study population, interventions, outcomes, and risks of bias. Risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated from numbers of events and numbers of participants at risk which were extracted from each included study. The reported RRs were extracted where crude event rates were not provided. Data were pooled using the random-effects model. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. We included 113 studies, enrolling 51,959 participants; 90 studies (40,597 CKD participants) compared an antiplatelet agent with placebo or no treatment, and 29 studies (11,805 CKD participants) directly compared one antiplatelet agent with another. Fifty-six new studies were added to this 2021 update. Seven studies originally excluded from the 2013 review were included, although they had a follow-up lower than two months. Random sequence generation and allocation concealment were at low risk of bias in 16 and 22 studies, respectively. Sixty-four studies reported low-risk methods for blinding of participants and investigators; outcome assessment was blinded in 41 studies. Forty-one studies were at low risk of attrition bias, 50 studies were at low risk of selective reporting bias, and 57 studies were at low risk of other potential sources of bias. Compared to placebo or no treatment, antiplatelet agents probably reduces myocardial infarction (18 studies, 15,289 participants: RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.99, IÃÆÃÆÃâÃÂ¯ÃÆÃâÃâÃÂ¿ÃÆÃâÃâÃÂ½ = 0%; moderate certainty). Antiplatelet agents has uncertain effects on fatal or nonfatal stroke (12 studies, 10.382 participants: RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.59, I2 = 37%; very low certainty) and may have little or no effect on death from any cause (35 studies, 18,241 participants: RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.06, I2 = 14%; low certainty). Antiplatelet therapy probably increases major bleeding in people with CKD and those treated with haemodialysis (HD) (29 studies, 16,194 participants: RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.65, I2 = 12%; moderate certainty). In addition, antiplatelet therapy may increase minor bleeding in people with CKD and those treated with HD (21 studies, 13,218 participants: RR 1.55, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.90, I2= 58%; low certainty). Antiplatelet treatment may reduce early dialysis vascular access thrombosis (8 studies, 1525 participants: RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.70; low certainty). Antiplatelet agents may reduce doubling of serum creatinine in CKD (3 studies, 217 participants: RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.86, I2 = 8%; low certainty). The treatment effects of antiplatelet agents on stroke, cardiovascular death, kidney failure, kidney transplant graft loss, transplant rejection, creatinine clearance, proteinuria, dialysis access failure, loss of primary unassisted patency, failure to attain suitability for dialysis, need of intervention and cardiovascular hospitalisation were uncertain. Limited data were available for direct head-to-head comparisons of antiplatelet drugs, including prasugrel, ticagrelor, different doses of clopidogrel, abciximab, defibrotide, sarpogrelate and beraprost. Antiplatelet agents probably reduced myocardial infarction and increased major bleeding, but do not appear to reduce all-cause and cardiovascular death among people with CKD and those treated with dialysis. The treatment effects of antiplatelet agents compared with each other are uncertain.","People with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have an increased risk of heart disease that can block the blood supply to the heart or brain causing a heart attack or stroke. Drugs that prevent blood clots from forming (antiplatelet agents) can prevent deaths caused by clots in arteries in the general adult population. However, there may be fewer benefits for people who have CKD, because blood clots in arteries is a less common cause of death or reason to be admitted to hospital compared with heart failure or sudden death in these people. People with CKD also have an increased tendency for bleeding due to changes in how the blood clots, so antiplatelet agents may therefore be more hazardous when CKD is present. This updated review evaluated the benefits and harms of antiplatelet agents to prevent cardiovascular disease and death, and the impact on dialysis vascular access (fistula or graft) function in people who have CKD. We identified 90 studies comparing antiplatelet agents with placebo or no treatment and 29 studies directly comparing one antiplatelet agent with another. Antiplatelet agents probably prevent heart attacks, but do not clearly reduce death or stroke. Treatment with these agents may increase the risk of major and minor bleeding. Clotting of dialysis access was prevented with antiplatelet agents. The benefits of antiplatelet agents for people with CKD is probably limited to the prevention of a heart attack; the treatment does not appear to prevent stroke or death and probably incurs excess serious bleeding that may require hospital admission or transfusion.",1091,Antiplatelet agents; renal replacement therapy; dialysis; myocardial infarction; fatal or nonfatal stroke; major bleeding; dialysis vascular access thrombosis; serum creatinine; cardiovascular death; transplant graft loss,What is one potential benefit of antiplatelet agents for people with CKD?,Which outcome is not significantly reduced by antiplatelet agents in CKD patients?,Select all of the following that are colors,Identify a potential risk associated with antiplatelet use in CKD patients.,Describe the impact of antiplatelet agents on the risk of heart attack in CKD patients.,Preventing heart attacks; Reducing all-cause mortality; Decreasing major bleeding,Preventing heart attacks,Stroke; Heart attack; Dialysis access clotting,Stroke,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Major bleeding; Increased kidney function; Decreased hospitalization,Major bleeding,They probably prevent heart attacks.; They have no effect on heart attacks.; They increase the risk of heart attacks.,They probably prevent heart attacks.
695ff06044ca743d0c309f99,interactive_4,Using computers to self-manage type 2 diabetes,"Diabetes is one of the commonest chronic medical conditions, affecting around 347 million adults worldwide. Structured patient education programmes reduce the risk of diabetes-related complications four-fold. Internet-based self-management programmes have been shown to be effective for a number of long-term conditions, but it is unclear what are the essential or effective components of such programmes. If computer-based self-management interventions improve outcomes in type 2 diabetes, they could potentially provide a cost-effective option for reducing the burdens placed on patients and healthcare systems by this long-term condition.
To assess the effects on health status and health-related quality of life of computer-based diabetes self-management interventions for adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
We searched six electronic bibliographic databases for published articles and conference proceedings and three online databases for theses (all up to November 2011). Reference lists of relevant reports and reviews were also screened.
Randomised controlled trials of computer-based self-management interventions for adults with type 2 diabetes, i.e. computer-based software applications that respond to user input and aim to generate tailored content to improve one or more self-management domains through feedback, tailored advice, reinforcement and rewards, patient decision support, goal setting or reminders.
Two review authors independently screened the abstracts and extracted data. A taxonomy for behaviour change techniques was used to describe the active ingredients of the intervention.
We identified 16 randomised controlled trials with 3578 participants that fitted our inclusion criteria. These studies included a wide spectrum of interventions covering clinic-based brief interventions, Internet-based interventions that could be used from home and mobile phone-based interventions. The mean age of participants was between 46 to 67 years old and mean time since diagnosis was 6 to 13 years. The duration of the interventions varied between 1 to 12 months. There were three reported deaths out of 3578 participants. Computer-based diabetes self-management interventions currently have limited effectiveness. They appear to have small benefits on glycaemic control (pooled effect on glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c): -2.3 mmol/mol or -0.2% (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.4 to -0.1; P = 0.009; 2637 participants; 11 trials). The effect size on HbA1c was larger in the mobile phone subgroup (subgroup analysis: mean difference in HbA1c -5.5 mmol/mol or -0.5% (95% CI -0.7 to -0.3); P < 0.00001; 280 participants; three trials). Current interventions do not show adequate evidence for improving depression, health-related quality of life or weight. Four (out of 10) interventions showed beneficial effects on lipid profile. One participant withdrew because of anxiety but there were no other documented adverse effects. Two studies provided limited cost-effectiveness data - with one study suggesting costs per patient of less than $140 (in 1997) or 105 EURO and another study showed no change in health behaviour and resource utilisation.
Computer-based diabetes self-management interventions to manage type 2 diabetes appear to have a small beneficial effect on blood glucose control and the effect was larger in the mobile phone subgroup. There is no evidence to show benefits in other biological outcomes or any cognitive, behavioural or emotional outcomes.","Diabetes is one of the commonest long-term medical conditions, affecting around 347 million adults worldwide. Around 90% of them have type 2 diabetes and are at significant risk of developing diabetes related complications such as strokes or heart attacks. Patient education programmes can reduce the risk of diabetes-related complications, but many people with type 2 diabetes have never attended structured education programmes to learn how to look after themselves (self-management). Better use of computers might be one way of helping more people learn about self-management.
We identified 16 trials involving 3578 adults that met our criteria. These studies included different types of interventions used in different places like touch screen computers in hospital clinics, computers connected to the Internet at home and programmes that communicated with mobile phones. The average age of people taking part was between 46 to 67 years old and most of those people had lived with diabetes for 6 to 13 years. Participants were given access to the interventions for 1 to 12 months, depending on the intervention. Three out of the 3578 participants died but these deaths did not appear to be linked to the trials.
Overall, there is evidence that computer programmes have a small beneficial effect on blood sugar control - the estimated improvement in glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c - a long-term measurement of metabolic control) was 2.3 mmol/mol or 0.2%. This was slightly higher when we looked at studies that used mobile phones to deliver their intervention - the estimated improvement in HbA1c was 5.5 mmol/mol or 0.5% in the studies that used mobile phones. Some of the programmes lowered cholesterol slightly. None of the programmes helped with weight loss or coping with depression.
One participant withdrew because of anxiety but there were no obvious side effects and hypoglycaemic episodes were not reported in any of the studies. There was very little information about costs or value for money.
In summary, existing computer programmes to help adults self-manage type 2 diabetes appear to have a small positive effect on blood sugar control and the mobile phone interventions appeared to have larger effects. There is no evidence to show that current programmes can help with weight loss, depression or improving health-related quality of life but they do appear to be safe.",1003,type 2 diabetes mellitus; glycaemic control; computer-based self-management interventions; glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c); lipid profile; health-related quality of life; computer-based software applications; behaviour change techniques; mobile phone-based interventions; self-management domains,How do the motivations for using computer-based interventions relate to the potential cost-effectiveness in managing type 2 diabetes?,In what ways do the findings reflect a need to redesign future self-management programmes for improved outcomes?,Select all of the following that are colors,Evaluate the significance of glycaemic control improvements achieved through mobile phone interventions compared to other methods.,Summarize the overall effectiveness of computer-based interventions on blood sugar control.,Computer-based interventions can reduce resource burdens on healthcare systems.; They are primarily intended to replace traditional diabetes education programmes.; The goal is to increase the number of hypoglycaemic episodes reported.,Computer-based interventions can reduce resource burdens on healthcare systems.,Focus should be placed on addressing weight loss and depression.; Interventions should decrease reliance on hospital-based touch screen computers.; Current designs should emphasize increasing cholesterol reduction.,Focus should be placed on addressing weight loss and depression.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Mobile interventions yielded superior glycaemic outcomes.; Mobile interventions were less effective than traditional methods.; All methods are equally beneficial.,Mobile interventions yielded superior glycaemic outcomes.,They have a small beneficial effect.; They have a large beneficial effect.; They have no effect.,They have a small beneficial effect.

We identified all relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) by searching the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, Science Citation Index Expanded, the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Literature on Coronavirus Disease database, and the COVID Network Meta-Analysis database with no language restrictions up to 26 April 2024. In outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19, molnupiravir 800 mg taken orally every 12 hours for five days probably results in little to no difference in all-cause mortality and may result in little to no difference in rates of hospitalisation and symptom resolution. There is evidence of increased viral clearance by day 5, but the clinical relevance of this finding is unclear. There is probably little to no difference in adverse events, and there is little to no difference in serious adverse events, with molnupiravir versus placebo or standard care. Inpatient data are lacking, and there is no evidence of benefit of molnupiravir in this population. Further research involving inpatients may change this.","Molnupiravir is a pill used to treat COVID-19 in people who are at high risk of developing severe illness. It works by interfering with the ability of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) to reproduce, helping the body to fight off the infection. We wanted to find out how molnupiravir compares to no treatment, placebo (dummy treatment), or standard of care in decreasing death and hospitalisation in people with COVID-19; speeding up recovery (time to symptom resolution); clearing the virus that causes COVID-19 (viral clearance); safety, by looking at all unwanted events and serious unwanted events. We searched for studies that evaluated molnupiravir compared with no treatment, placebo, or standard of care in people with confirmed COVID-19. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods. The types of studies we looked at were randomised controlled trials, which assign people randomly to two or more treatment groups. This is the best way to ensure that study groups are similar, and that investigators and participants don't know who is in which group. The review included 11 studies with 31,272 participants, mostly outpatients (people not admitted to hospital) with mild to moderate COVID-19. When we combined results from studies that recruited outpatients (people not admitted to hospital) with mild to moderate COVID-19, we found the following key results: Molnupiravir probably results in little to no difference in the risk of death. Compared with people receiving placebo or standard of care, between four and 10 fewer people receiving molnupiravir will die within one month for every 10,000 people treated. We considered this reduction clinically insignificant. Molnupiravir may not reduce hospitalisations, meaning it may not prevent people from getting sicker or needing hospital care. There was evidence of increased viral clearance with molnupiravir by day 5, but this effect diminished by day 14, and we are not sure if it makes any real difference for patients. Molnupiravir may have little to no effect on the probability of having no symptoms by day 14 or day 28. Molnupiravir probably results in little to no difference in adverse events, and results in little to no difference in serious adverse events. There are too few data to draw clear conclusions about molnupiravir's effects in people admitted to hospital with severe COVID-19. Most evidence comes from studies conducted in outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19, so the results may not apply to people with severe illness who are hospitalised. The studies provided scarce evidence on long-term outcomes such as quality of life after recovery or how long the virus stays in the body. We were unable to analyse whether molnupiravir had a different effect in certain groups of people, like those with severe pre-existing conditions or people from low- or middle-income countries.",1106,molnupiravir; SARS-CoV-2; mild to moderate COVID-19; all-cause mortality; symptom resolution; viral clearance; clinical relevance; adverse events,What reasoning could justify the conclusion that molnupiravir has little effect on hospitalisations in mild COVID-19 cases?,How might the design of future studies be improved to better assess molnupiravir's effectiveness in severe COVID-19 cases?,Select the items that are animals,What conclusions might be drawn from the evidence of increased viral clearance by day 5 with no significant impact on symptoms?,What challenges could arise in interpreting the clinical relevance of viral clearance associated with molnupiravir?,No significant difference in hospitalisation rates compared to placebo; Possible misinterpretation of viral clearance as recovery; Bias introduced by non-randomized study designs,No significant difference in hospitalisation rates compared to placebo,Including a larger sample of hospitalised patients; Excluding all outpatients to reduce variability; Focusing on participants from higher-income countries,Including a larger sample of hospitalised patients,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,Viral clearance may not correlate directly with clinical outcomes; The study possibly had errors in measuring viral load; Molnupiravir has a durable effect lasting beyond day 5,Viral clearance may not correlate directly with clinical outcomes,Lack of alignment between viral clearance and patient recovery; Overstated results from non-peer-reviewed studies; Underrepresentation of severe cases in the data,Lack of alignment between viral clearance and patient recovery
695ff06044ca743d0c309f99,finetuned_5,Green tea for the prevention of cancer,"This review is an update of a previously published review in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009, Issue 3).Tea is one of the most commonly consumed beverages worldwide. Teas from the plant Camellia sinensis can be grouped into green, black and oolong tea, and drinking habits vary cross-culturally. C sinensis contains polyphenols, one subgroup being catechins. Catechins are powerful antioxidants, and laboratory studies have suggested that these compounds may inhibit cancer cell proliferation. Some experimental and nonexperimental epidemiological studies have suggested that green tea may have cancer-preventative effects.
To assess possible associations between green tea consumption and the risk of cancer incidence and mortality as primary outcomes, and safety data and quality of life as secondary outcomes.
We searched eligible studies up to January 2019 in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and reference lists of previous reviews and included studies.
We included all epidemiological studies, experimental (i.e. randomised controlled trials (RCTs)) and nonexperimental (non-randomised studies, i.e. observational studies with both cohort and case-control design) that investigated the association of green tea consumption with cancer risk or quality of life, or both.
Two or more review authors independently applied the study criteria, extracted data and assessed methodological quality of studies. We summarised the results according to diagnosis of cancer type.
In this review update, we included in total 142 completed studies (11 experimental and 131 nonexperimental) and two ongoing studies. This is an additional 10 experimental and 85 nonexperimental studies from those included in the previous version of the review. Eleven experimental studies allocated a total of 1795 participants to either green tea extract or placebo, all demonstrating an overall high methodological quality based on 'Risk of bias' assessment. For incident prostate cancer, the summary risk ratio (RR) in the green tea-supplemented participants was 0.50 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 1.36), based on three studies and involving 201 participants (low-certainty evidence). The summary RR for gynaecological cancer was 1.50 (95% CI 0.41 to 5.48; 2 studies, 1157 participants; low-certainty evidence). No evidence of effect of non-melanoma skin cancer emerged (summary RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.92; 1 study, 1075 participants; low-certainty evidence). In addition, adverse effects of green tea extract intake were reported, including gastrointestinal disorders, elevation of liver enzymes, and, more rarely, insomnia, raised blood pressure and skin/subcutaneous reactions. Consumption of green tea extracts induced a slight improvement in quality of life, compared with placebo, based on three experimental studies. In nonexperimental studies, we included over 1,100,000 participants from 46 cohort studies and 85 case-control studies, which were on average of intermediate to high methodological quality based on Newcastle-Ottawa Scale 'Risk of bias' assessment. When comparing the highest intake of green tea with the lowest, we found a lower overall cancer incidence (summary RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.07), based on three studies, involving 52,479 participants (low-certainty evidence). Conversely, we found no association between green tea consumption and cancer-related mortality (summary RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.07), based on eight studies and 504,366 participants (low-certainty evidence). For most of the site-specific cancers we observed a decreased RR in the highest category of green tea consumption compared with the lowest one. After stratifying the analysis according to study design, we found strongly conflicting results for some cancer sites: oesophageal, prostate and urinary tract cancer, and leukaemia showed an increased RR in cohort studies and a decreased RR or no difference in case-control studies.
Overall, findings from experimental and nonexperimental epidemiological studies yielded inconsistent results, thus providing limited evidence for the beneficial effect of green tea consumption on the overall risk of cancer or on specific cancer sites. Some evidence of a beneficial effect of green tea at some cancer sites emerged from the RCTs and from case-control studies, but their methodological limitations, such as the low number and size of the studies, and the inconsistencies with the results of cohort studies, limit the interpretability of the RR estimates. The studies also indicated the occurrence of several side effects associated with high intakes of green tea. In addition, the majority of included studies were carried out in Asian populations characterised by a high intake of green tea, thus limiting the generalisability of the findings to other populations. Well conducted and adequately powered RCTs would be needed to draw conclusions on the possible beneficial effects of green tea consumption on cancer risk.","There is a high consumption worldwide of green tea (Camellia sinensis), that contains polyphenols which have a powerful antioxidant activity that can prevent the formation of free radicals that may cause damage and cell death. Therefore it has been suggested that green tea might reduce cancer risk, a theory that has been tested through a number of studies on human populations, which examined the link between green tea consumption and cancer. We assessed the association between green tea consumption and the risk of developing cancer in epidemiologic studies. In this review we included 142 studies with more than 1.1 million participants looking for an association between green tea consumption and cancers of the digestive tract and the female reproductive system, breast, prostate, kidney and urinary tract, nasopharynx, lung, blood, skin, thyroid and brain. The majority of the studies were of medium to high quality in terms of how they were conducted. Overall, the evidence from the studies showed that the consumption of green tea to reduce the risk of cancer was inconsistent. Some studies suggested a beneficial effect on cancer risk, while others indicated no effect, and even suggested a slightly increased cancer risk. In particular, results from experimental studies suggested that green tea extract supplementation yielded a decreased risk for prostate cancer, but increased risk for gynaecological cancers. For non-melanoma skin cancer no difference in cancer cases emerged. Green tea supplementation seemed to slightly improve quality of life compared with placebo, although it was associated with some adverse effects including gastrointestinal disorders, higher levels of liver enzymes, and, more rarely, insomnia, raised blood pressure and skin reactions. In nonexperimental studies, comparing people consuming the highest amount of green tea to those in the lowest category of consumption, we found an indication of a lower occurrence of new cases of overall types of cancer, while no difference emerged for lethal cases. However, results according to the type of cancer and study design were inconsistent. A beneficial effect of green tea consumption on cancer prevention remains unproven so far.

695ff06044ca743d0c309f99,finetuned_6,What are the benefits and risks of vaccines for preventing COVID-19?,"Different forms of vaccines have been developed to prevent the SARS-CoV-2 virus and subsequent COVID-19 disease, and several are in widespread global use. The objective was to assess the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines, whether as a full primary series or booster dose, against SARS-CoV-2. We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and the COVID-19 LOVE platform (last search 5 November 2021), as well as the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, regulatory agency websites, and Retraction Watch. We included randomized controlled trials comparing COVID-19 vaccines with placebo, no vaccine, other active vaccines, or other vaccine schedules. Using standard Cochrane methods and GRADE for all outcomes except immunogenicity, we synthesized data for each vaccine separately and presented summary effect estimates with 95% confidence intervals. We included 41 RCTs assessing 12 vaccines, including homologous and heterologous schedules and booster doses; 32 were multicentre and five were multinational, with sample sizes ranging from 60 to 44,325 participants. Participants were aged 18 years or older in 36 RCTs, 12 years or older in one, 12 to 17 years in two, and three to 17 years in two; 29 trials included people over 60, three included immunocompromized patients, and none included pregnant women. Follow-up was ? two months in 16 RCTs, two to six months in 20, and > six to 12 months in five; 18 were preplanned interim analyses. Overall risk of bias was low for all outcomes in eight RCTs, while 33 had concerns for at least one outcome. We identified 343 registered RCTs with unavailable results. This abstract reports results for symptomatic COVID-19, severe/critical COVID-19, and serious adverse events for the 10 WHO-approved vaccines. Evidence for mortality was sparse and low or very low certainty for all vaccines except AD26.COV2.S (Janssen), which probably reduces all-cause mortality (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.67; 1 RCT, 43,783 participants; high-certainty evidence). High-certainty evidence shows that BNT162b2 (Pfizer), mRNA-1273 (Moderna), ChAdOx1 (AstraZeneca), Ad26.COV2.S, BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm-Beijing), and BBV152 (Bharat Biotech) reduce symptomatic COVID-19 compared with placebo, with vaccine efficacy ranging from about 66% to over 97% based on multiple trials. Moderate-certainty evidence shows that NVX-CoV2373 (Novavax) probably reduces symptomatic infection, while CoronaVac (Sinovac) has low-certainty evidence due to heterogeneity between its two trials. For severe or critical COVID-19, high-certainty evidence indicates that BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, Ad26.COV2.S, and BBV152 produce large reductions in severe disease, with efficacy estimates ranging from about 76% to over 98%; NVX-CoV2373 probably reduces severe disease; and two CoronaVac trials reported high efficacy but could not be pooled. For serious adverse events, mRNA-1273, ChAdOx1/SII-ChAdOx1, Ad26.COV2.S, and BBV152 probably result in little or no difference compared with placebo (RRs ranging from 0.65 to 0.92), with absolute differences fewer than 5 per 1000 participants. Evidence for SAEs is uncertain for BNT162b2, CoronaVac, BBIBP-CorV, and NVX-CoV2373 due to wide confidence intervals and low event counts. For heterologous schedules, boosters, and variant-specific efficacy, see the full review. Compared with placebo, most vaccines reduce or likely reduce symptomatic COVID-19, and several show high-certainty reductions in severe or critical disease, with probably little or no difference in serious adverse events. Over 300 registered RCTs continue to evaluate COVID-19 vaccines, and this review is regularly updated on the COVID-NMA platform. Due to trial exclusions, results cannot be generalized to pregnant women, individuals with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, or immunocompromized people; most trials had short follow-up and occurred before variants of concern emerged. Future research should evaluate long-term effects, compare vaccines and schedules, assess efficacy and safety in specific populations, include outcomes such as preventing long COVID-19, and continually monitor protection against emerging variants.","SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) is the virus that causes COVID-19 disease, and not everyone infected will develop symptoms, which can range from mild (such as fever and headaches) to life-threatening (such as difficulty breathing), or death. While vaccines work slightly differently, they all prepare the body's immune system to prevent people from getting infected with SARS-CoV-2 or, if they do get infected, to prevent severe disease. We wanted to find out how well each vaccine works in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection, symptomatic COVID-19, severe COVID-19 disease, and total deaths (including any cause), as well as serious adverse events requiring hospitalization or being life-threatening, systemic reactogenicity events (short-term immunological reactions like fever, headache, body aches, and fatigue), and any adverse events including non-serious ones. We searched for studies examining any COVID-19 vaccine compared with placebo, no vaccine, or another COVID-19 vaccine, selecting only randomized trials that evaluate interventions under ideal conditions among participants assigned by chance to different groups, and we summarized results and rated our confidence in the evidence based on study conduct. We found 41 worldwide studies involving 433,838 people assessing 12 vaccines; 35 included only healthy people who had never had COVID-19, 36 included only adults, two only adolescents, two children and adolescents, and one adolescents and adults; three involved people with weakened immune systems, and none involved pregnant women. Most studies assessed results less than six months after primary vaccination, most received co-funding from academic institutions and pharmaceutical companies, most compared a COVID-19 vaccine with placebo, and five evaluated a 'mix and match' booster. We report results for three main outcomes and for 10 WHO-approved vaccines: there is insufficient evidence regarding deaths between vaccines and placebo except for the Janssen vaccine, which probably reduces all-cause deaths. The Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Sinopharm-Beijing, and Bharat vaccines produce a large reduction in symptomatic COVID-19, Janssen reduces symptomatic cases, Novavax probably produces a large reduction, and CoronaVac has insufficient evidence because results differed between its two studies. For severe disease, Pfizer, Moderna, Janssen, and Bharat produce a large reduction, while evidence for CoronaVac is insufficient due to differing study results. For serious adverse events, Pfizer, CoronaVac, Sinopharm-Beijing, and Novavax have insufficient evidence due to low numbers of events, while Moderna, AstraZeneca, Janssen, and Bharat probably result in no or little difference in serious adverse events. Most studies assessed vaccines for a short time after injection, making it unclear how protection wanes over time; exclusion criteria limit generalizability to pregnant women, people with prior infection, and those with weakened immune systems; more research is needed comparing vaccines, schedules, effectiveness, and safety in specific populations and outcomes such as preventing long COVID-19; and most studies were conducted before variants of concern emerged.",1110,COVID-19 vaccines; placebo; vaccine efficacy; homologous schedules; heterologous schedules; booster doses; symptomatic COVID-19; severe/critical COVID-19; serious adverse events; variants of concern,What are the implications of the short follow-up period noted in many studies regarding vaccine efficacy?,How could future research be designed to improve understanding of vaccine performance against emerging variants?,Select the items that are animals,What reasoning supports the conclusion that most vaccines probably reduce severe COVID-19 disease?,"How did the results of CoronaVac differ between the two trials, and why is this significant?",Long-term effectiveness might be underestimated due to short follow-up.; Short follow-up guarantees accurate assessment of immediate adverse events.; It provides a comprehensive view of vaccine efficacy against emerging variants.,Long-term effectiveness might be underestimated due to short follow-up.,Incorporating diverse geographic regions where variants are spreading rapidly.; Limiting studies to specific age groups already well-researched in past studies.; Extending the study duration to capture changes in variant prevalence.,Incorporating diverse geographic regions where variants are spreading rapidly.; Extending the study duration to capture changes in variant prevalence.,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,High-certainty evidence from multiple trials demonstrating efficacy in severe disease prevention.; Uniform efficacy rates observed across all studied vaccines.; Consistent reduction in hospitalization rates in the vaccinated groups.,High-certainty evidence from multiple trials demonstrating efficacy in severe disease prevention.; Consistent reduction in hospitalization rates in the vaccinated groups.,"The trials demonstrated contradictory efficacy results, complicating overall interpretation.; Both trials showed identical efficacy against severe COVID-19.; The results highlighted a varying immune response across different populations.","The trials demonstrated contradictory efficacy results, complicating overall interpretation.; The results highlighted a varying immune response across different populations."
695ff06044ca743d0c309f99,finetuned_6,Which exercise is better for reducing fatigue caused by cancer: cardiovascular or resistance training?,"With prevalence estimates between 50% and 90% of people with cancer, cancer-related fatigue is one of the most common morbidities related to cancer and its treatment. Exercise is beneficial for the treatment of cancer-related fatigue. However, the efficacy of different types of exercise (i.e. cardiovascular training and resistance training) have not yet been investigated systematically and compared directly in a meta-analysis.
To compare the benefits and harms of cardiovascular training versus resistance training for treatment or prevention of cancer-related fatigue in people with cancer.
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and five other databases in January 2023. We searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials. We integrated results from update searches of previously published Cochrane reviews. In total, our searches included trials from inception to October 2023.
We included randomised controlled trials investigating cardiovascular training compared with resistance training, with exercise as the main component. We included studies on adults with cancer (aged 18 years and older), with or without a diagnosis of cancer-related fatigue, for any type of cancer and any type of cancer treatment, with the intervention starting before, during, or after treatment. We included trials evaluating at least one of our primary outcomes (cancer-related fatigue or quality of life). We excluded combined cardiovascular and resistance interventions, yoga, and mindfulness-based interventions. Our primary outcomes were cancer-related fatigue and quality of life. Our secondary outcomes were adverse events, anxiety, and depression.
We used standard Cochrane methodology. For analyses, we pooled results within the same period of outcome assessment (i.e. short term (up to and including 12 weeks' follow-up), medium term (more than 12 weeks' to less than six months' follow-up), and long term (six months' follow-up or longer)). We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane RoB 1 tool, and certainty of the evidence using GRADE.
We included six studies with 447 participants with prostate, breast, or lung cancer who received radiotherapy or chemotherapy, had surgery, or a combination of these. All studies had a high risk of bias due to lack of blinding. Three studies had an additional high risk of bias domain; one study for attrition bias, and two studies for selection bias. Interventions in the cardiovascular training groups included training on a cycle ergometer, treadmill, an elliptical trainer, or indoor bike. Interventions in the resistance training group included a varying number of exercises using bodyweight, weights, or resistance bands. Interventions varied in frequency, intensity, and duration. None of the included studies reported including participants with a confirmed cancer-related fatigue diagnosis. The interventions in four studies started during cancer treatment and in two studies after cancer treatment. Before treatment No studies reported interventions starting before cancer treatment. During treatment the evidence was very uncertain about the effect of cardiovascular training compared with resistance training for short-term cancer-related fatigue (mean difference (MD)-0.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.52 to 1.84; 4 studies, 311 participants; Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue) scale where higher values indicate better outcome; very low-certainty evidence) and long-term cancer-related fatigue (MD 1.30, 95% CI: 2.17 to 4.77; 1 study, 141 participants; FACIT-Fatigue scale; very low-certainty evidence). The evidence was very uncertain about the effect of cardiovascular training compared with resistance training for short-term quality of life (MD 1.47, 95% CI -1.47 to 4.42; 4 studies, 319 participants; Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy General scale where higher values indicate better outcome; very low-certainty evidence) and for long-term quality of life (MD 3.40, 95% CI -4.85 to 11.65; 1 study, 141 participants; Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Anemia scale where higher values indicate better outcome; very low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of cardiovascular training compared with resistance training on the occurrence of adverse events at any follow-up (risk ratio (RR) 2.00, 95% CI 0.19 to 21.18; 2 studies, 128 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No studies reported medium-term cancer-related fatigue or quality of life. After treatment, the evidence was very uncertain about the effect of cardiovascular training compared with resistance training for short-term cancer-related fatigue (MD 1.47, 95% CI -0.09 to 3.03; 1 study, 95 participants; Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory 20 General Fatigue subscale where higher values indicate worse outcome; very low-certainty evidence). Resistance training may improve short-term quality of life compared to cardiovascular training, but the evidence is very uncertain (MD -10.96, 95% CI -17.77 to -4.15; 1 study, 95 participants; European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30 Global Health subscale where higher values indicate better outcome; very low-certainty evidence). No studies reported outcomes at medium-term or long-term follow-up. Overall, the evidence is very uncertain about the effects of cardiovascular training compared with resistance training on treatment of cancer-related fatigue in people with cancer. Larger, well-conducted studies including people with different cancer types receiving different treatments are needed to increase the certainty in the evidence and to better understand who may benefit most from cardiovascular or resistance training. Moreover, studies comparing the effects of cardiovascular and resistance training initiated before as well as after cancer treatment are needed to understand the prophylactic and rehabilitative effects of these exercise types on cancer-related fatigue.","Fatigue caused by cancer is a feeling of extreme tiredness that lasts for a long time. It is related to cancer or cancer treatment, or both. It affects both the body and feelings, and can make it difficult to do regular activities. Fatigue caused by cancer is a lot worse than regular tiredness, and it does not go away with more sleep or rest.
We wanted to find out if there are differences between cardiovascular training and resistance training for the treatment and prevention of fatigue caused by cancer, well-being (also known as quality of life), and unwanted effects. Cardiovascular training involves exercise such as walking, running, swimming, and cycling, whereas resistance training includes exercise using one's own bodyweight, weights, or elastic therapy bands.
We searched for studies that compared cardiovascular training and resistance training in people with any type of cancer. Training could have been started before, during, or after cancer treatment.
We summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.
We found six studies that involved 447 people with breast cancer, prostate cancer (a small gland in the pelvis that is part of the male reproductive system), or lung cancer. These studies did not report if people already had fatigue caused by cancer before starting to exercise. People in these studies were treated with chemotherapy (medicines to kill the cancer), radiotherapy (radiation directed at the cancer to reduce or kill it), surgery (to remove the cancer), or a combination of these. The cardiovascular or resistance training started during or after cancer treatment. Most studies looked at short-term results (up to and including 12 weeks of monitoring), only one study had long-term results (six months or longer of monitoring). Studies were supported by research grants and took place in Canada, Belgium, the USA, and Germany.
The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of cardiovascular and resistance training on fatigue caused by cancer, well-being, and unwanted effects in the short or long term.
Our confidence in the evidence is very low. We found only a few studies including low numbers of people. We also found problems in the methods of the studies.

To assess possible associations between green tea consumption and the risk of cancer incidence and mortality as primary outcomes, and safety data and quality of life as secondary outcomes.
We searched eligible studies up to January 2019 in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and reference lists of previous reviews and included studies.
We included all epidemiological studies, experimental (i.e. randomised controlled trials (RCTs)) and nonexperimental (non-randomised studies, i.e. observational studies with both cohort and case-control design) that investigated the association of green tea consumption with cancer risk or quality of life, or both.
Two or more review authors independently applied the study criteria, extracted data and assessed methodological quality of studies. We summarised the results according to diagnosis of cancer type.
In this review update, we included in total 142 completed studies (11 experimental and 131 nonexperimental) and two ongoing studies. This is an additional 10 experimental and 85 nonexperimental studies from those included in the previous version of the review. Eleven experimental studies allocated a total of 1795 participants to either green tea extract or placebo, all demonstrating an overall high methodological quality based on 'Risk of bias' assessment. For incident prostate cancer, the summary risk ratio (RR) in the green tea-supplemented participants was 0.50 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 1.36), based on three studies and involving 201 participants (low-certainty evidence). The summary RR for gynaecological cancer was 1.50 (95% CI 0.41 to 5.48; 2 studies, 1157 participants; low-certainty evidence). No evidence of effect of non-melanoma skin cancer emerged (summary RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.92; 1 study, 1075 participants; low-certainty evidence). In addition, adverse effects of green tea extract intake were reported, including gastrointestinal disorders, elevation of liver enzymes, and, more rarely, insomnia, raised blood pressure and skin/subcutaneous reactions. Consumption of green tea extracts induced a slight improvement in quality of life, compared with placebo, based on three experimental studies. In nonexperimental studies, we included over 1,100,000 participants from 46 cohort studies and 85 case-control studies, which were on average of intermediate to high methodological quality based on Newcastle-Ottawa Scale 'Risk of bias' assessment. When comparing the highest intake of green tea with the lowest, we found a lower overall cancer incidence (summary RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.07), based on three studies, involving 52,479 participants (low-certainty evidence). Conversely, we found no association between green tea consumption and cancer-related mortality (summary RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.07), based on eight studies and 504,366 participants (low-certainty evidence). For most of the site-specific cancers we observed a decreased RR in the highest category of green tea consumption compared with the lowest one. After stratifying the analysis according to study design, we found strongly conflicting results for some cancer sites: oesophageal, prostate and urinary tract cancer, and leukaemia showed an increased RR in cohort studies and a decreased RR or no difference in case-control studies.
Overall, findings from experimental and nonexperimental epidemiological studies yielded inconsistent results, thus providing limited evidence for the beneficial effect of green tea consumption on the overall risk of cancer or on specific cancer sites. Some evidence of a beneficial effect of green tea at some cancer sites emerged from the RCTs and from case-control studies, but their methodological limitations, such as the low number and size of the studies, and the inconsistencies with the results of cohort studies, limit the interpretability of the RR estimates. The studies also indicated the occurrence of several side effects associated with high intakes of green tea. In addition, the majority of included studies were carried out in Asian populations characterised by a high intake of green tea, thus limiting the generalisability of the findings to other populations. Well conducted and adequately powered RCTs would be needed to draw conclusions on the possible beneficial effects of green tea consumption on cancer risk.","There is a high consumption worldwide of green tea (Camellia sinensis), that contains polyphenols which have a powerful antioxidant activity that can prevent the formation of free radicals that may cause damage and cell death. Therefore it has been suggested that green tea might reduce cancer risk, a theory that has been tested through a number of studies on human populations, which examined the link between green tea consumption and cancer. We assessed the association between green tea consumption and the risk of developing cancer in epidemiologic studies. In this review we included 142 studies with more than 1.1 million participants looking for an association between green tea consumption and cancers of the digestive tract and the female reproductive system, breast, prostate, kidney and urinary tract, nasopharynx, lung, blood, skin, thyroid and brain. The majority of the studies were of medium to high quality in terms of how they were conducted. Overall, the evidence from the studies showed that the consumption of green tea to reduce the risk of cancer was inconsistent. Some studies suggested a beneficial effect on cancer risk, while others indicated no effect, and even suggested a slightly increased cancer risk. In particular, results from experimental studies suggested that green tea extract supplementation yielded a decreased risk for prostate cancer, but increased risk for gynaecological cancers. For non-melanoma skin cancer no difference in cancer cases emerged. Green tea supplementation seemed to slightly improve quality of life compared with placebo, although it was associated with some adverse effects including gastrointestinal disorders, higher levels of liver enzymes, and, more rarely, insomnia, raised blood pressure and skin reactions. In nonexperimental studies, comparing people consuming the highest amount of green tea to those in the lowest category of consumption, we found an indication of a lower occurrence of new cases of overall types of cancer, while no difference emerged for lethal cases. However, results according to the type of cancer and study design were inconsistent. A beneficial effect of green tea consumption on cancer prevention remains unproven so far.

60712d937752fb8780e89951,static_2,"Improving the implementation of healthy eating, physical activity and obesity prevention policies, practices or programmes in childcare services","Despite the existence of effective interventions and best-practice guideline recommendations for childcare services to implement evidence-based policies, practices and programmes to promote child healthy eating, physical activity and prevent unhealthy weight gain, many services fail to do so. The primary aim of the review was to examine the effectiveness of strategies aimed at improving the implementation of policies, practices or programmes by childcare services that promote child healthy eating, physical activity and/or obesity prevention.The secondary aims of the review were to: 1. Examine the cost or cost-effectiveness of such strategies;2. Examine any adverse effects of such strategies on childcare services, service staff or children;3. Examine the effect of such strategies on child diet, physical activity or weight status. 4. Describe the acceptability, adoption, penetration, sustainability and appropriateness of such implementation strategies. We searched the following electronic databases on February 22 2019: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In Process, Embase, PsycINFO, ERIC, CINAHL and SCOPUS for relevant studies. We searched reference lists of included studies, handsearched two international implementation science journals, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (www.who.int/ictrp/) and ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov). We included any study (randomised or nonrandomised) with a parallel control group that compared any strategy to improve the implementation of a healthy eating, physical activity or obesity prevention policy, practice or programme by staff of centre-based childcare services to no intervention, 'usual' practice or an alternative strategy. Centre-based childcare services included preschools, nurseries, long daycare services and kindergartens catering for children prior to compulsory schooling (typically up to the age of five to six years).
Two review authors independently screened study titles and abstracts, extracted study data and assessed risk of bias; we resolved discrepancies via consensus. We performed meta-analysis using a random-effects model where studies with suitable data and homogeneity were identified; otherwise, findings were described narratively. Twenty-one studies, including 16 randomised and five nonrandomised, were included in the review. The studies sought to improve the implementation of policies, practices or programmes targeting healthy eating (six studies), physical activity (three studies) or both healthy eating and physical activity (12 studies). Studies were conducted in the United States (n = 12), Australia (n = 8) and Ireland (n = 1). Collectively, the 21 studies included a total of 1945 childcare services examining a range of implementation strategies including educational materials, educational meetings, audit and feedback, opinion leaders, small incentives or grants, educational outreach visits or academic detailing, reminders and tailored interventions. Most studies (n = 19) examined implementation strategies versus usual practice or minimal support control, and two compared alternative implementation strategies. For implementation outcomes, six studies (one RCT) were judged to be at high risk of bias overall. The review findings suggest that implementation strategies probably improve the implementation of policies, practices or programmes that promote child healthy eating, physical activity and/or obesity prevention in childcare services. Of the 19 studies that compared a strategy to usual practice or minimal support control, 11 studies (nine RCTs) used score-based measures of implementation (e.g. childcare service nutrition environment score). Nine of these studies were included in pooled analysis, which found an improvement in implementation outcomes (SMD 0.49; 95% CI 0.19 to 0.79; participants = 495; moderate-certainty evidence). Ten studies (seven RCTs) used dichotomous measures of implementation (e.g. proportion of childcare services implementing a policy or specific practice), with seven of these included in pooled analysis (OR 1.83; 95% CI 0.81 to 4.11; participants = 391; low-certainty evidence). Findings suggest that such interventions probably lead to little or no difference in child physical activity (four RCTs; moderate-certainty evidence) or weight status (three RCTs; moderate-certainty evidence), and may lead to little or no difference in child diet (two RCTs; low-certainty evidence). None of the studies reported the cost or cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Three studies assessed the adverse effects of the intervention on childcare service staff, children and parents, with all studies suggesting they have little to no difference in adverse effects (e.g. child injury) between groups (three RCTs; low-certainty evidence). Inconsistent quality of the evidence was identified across review outcomes and study designs, ranging from very low to moderate. The primary limitation of the review was the lack of conventional terminology in implementation science, which may have resulted in potentially relevant studies failing to be identified based on the search terms used. Current research suggests that implementation strategies probably improve the implementation of policies, practices or programmes by childcare services, and may have little or no effect on measures of adverse effects. However such strategies appear to have little to no impact on measures of child diet, physical activity or weight status.","This review aimed to look at the effects of strategies to improve the implementation (or correct undertaking) of policies, practices or programmes by childcare services that promote children's healthy eating, physical activity and/or obesity prevention. We wanted to determine the cost or cost-effectiveness of providing implementation support, whether support strategies were associated with any adverse effects, and whether there was an impact on child nutrition, physical activity or weight status. We also looked at the implementation strategy acceptability, adoption, penetration, sustainability and appropriateness. A number of childcare service-based interventions have been found to be effective in improving child diet, increasing child physical activity and preventing excessive weight gain. Despite the existence of such evidence and best-practice guideline recommendations for childcare services to implement these policies, practices or programmes, many childcare services fail to do so. Without proper implementation, children will not benefit from these child health-directed policies, practices or programmes. We identified 21 studies, 19 of which examined implementation strategies versus usual practice or minimal support control, and two that compared different types of implementation strategies. The studies sought to improve the implementation of policies, practices or programmes targeting healthy eating (six studies), physical activity (three studies) or both healthy eating and physical activity (twelve studies). Collectively, the 21 included studies included a total of 1945 childcare services and examined a range of implementation strategies including educational materials, educational meetings, audit and feedback, opinion leaders, small incentives or grants, educational outreach visits or academic detailing, reminders and tailored interventions. The strategies tested were only a small number of those that could be applied to improve implementation in this setting. Findings suggest that implementation support strategies can improve the implementation of physical activity policies, programmes or practices by childcare services or their staff (moderate-certainty evidence), and do not appear to increase the risk of child injury (low-certainty evidence). However, such approaches do not appear to have an impact on the diet, physical activity or weight status of children (low to moderate-certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported information regarding implementation strategy costs or measures of cost-effectiveness.

60712d937752fb8780e89951,static_2,Does yoga relieve cancer-related fatigue in people with cancer?,"Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is one of the most prevalent symptoms in individuals with cancer. Various types of exercise have shown beneficial effects. While previous systematic reviews suggest exercise may improve CRF and quality of life, evidence specifically about yoga's impact, as well as evidence on long-term effects, is limited. Previous syntheses offer promising but inconclusive findings on yoga's effectiveness. This review is one of a suite of five reviews exploring exercise for cancer-related fatigue.
To assess the effects of yoga versus no yoga on cancer-related fatigue in people with cancer: before, during, and after anticancer treatment; in the short, medium, and long term; and effects on quality of life (QoL), adverse events, depression, and anxiety.
We used CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, five other databases and two trials registers, together with reference checking, citation searching and contact with study authors to identify studies that are included in the review. The latest search date was October 2023.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing yoga to no yoga. We included studies in adults (aged 18 and older) with any type of cancer and anticancer therapy who received yoga before, during, or after anticancer therapy. We included trials evaluating at least one of the main outcomes (CRF or QoL). Yoga had to last for at least five sessions, and involve face-to-face instruction. We excluded trials with fewer than 20 participants randomised per group.
The outcomes of interest in this review are cancer-related fatigue (CRF), quality of life (QoL), adverse events, depression, and anxiety. We used standard methods expected by Cochrane. For analyses, we pooled results within the same period of outcome assessment (i.e. short, medium, and long term), and employed a random-effects model. We assessed risk of bias with the Cochrane risk of bias (RoB) 1 tool, and used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence.
We included 21 RCTs with 2041 people with cancer who received yoga during (13 studies) or after (eight studies) anticancer therapy; none examined yoga initiated before therapy. Here we present results on CRF and QoL; findings on adverse events, depression, and anxiety are in the full review. Yoga during anticancer therapy The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of yoga compared to no yoga on: short-term CRF (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.18 to 0.32; mean difference (MD) on Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI; lower values mean better outcome) of 0.16, 95% CI -0.41 to 0.71; 3 studies, 253 participants); medium-term CRF (MD on Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI; lower values mean better outcome) of -1.30, 95% CI -3.50 to 0.90; 1 study, 67 participants); and long-term CRF (MD 0.09 on BFI, 95% CI 1.16 to 0.98; 2 studies, 155 participants) (all very low-certainty evidence). Yoga may have a small beneficial effect or no effect compared to no yoga on short-term QoL (SMD 0.25, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.45; MD on Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30 (QLQ-C30; higher values mean better outcome) of 5.28, 95% CI 0.84 to 9.56; 4 studies, 374 participants) and medium-term QoL (MD on QLQ-C30 of 7.63, 95% CI 6.71 to 21.97; 2 studies, 151 participants), but the evidence is very uncertain (all very low-certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported long-term QoL. Yoga after anticancer therapy Yoga probably has a beneficial effect compared to no yoga on short-term CRF (SMD -0.26, 95% CI -0.42 to -0.09; MD 2.55, 95% CI 0.88 to 4.12; higher values mean better outcome; 5 studies, 602 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Yoga might have a beneficial effect or no effect compared to no yoga on medium-term CRF, but the evidence is very uncertain (MD 3.02, 95% CI -1.48 to 7.52; 1 study, 54 participants (higher values mean better outcome; very low-certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported long-term CRF. Yoga may have a small beneficial effect or no effect compared to no yoga on short-term QoL (SMD 0.19, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.47; MD -3.27, 95% CI -8.08 to 1.55; higher values mean better outcome; 4 studies, 275 participants) and medium term QoL (MD 7.06, 95% CI -1.38 to 15.50; 1 study, 54 participants; higher values mean better outcome), but the evidence is very uncertain (all very low-certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported long-term QoL. A key limitation of the review was the included studies' methodological constraints: participants' awareness of treatment assignments (yoga or control) potentially introduced bias. Additionally, sample sizes were too small to determine medium- and long-term effects conclusively. Further research is needed to evaluate the sustainability of yoga's impact on cancer-related fatigue, quality of life, and adverse events.
Our review provides uncertain evidence of the beneficial effects of yoga initiated during or after anticancer therapy compared to no yoga for people with cancer. Although there are indications supporting the use of yoga to address CRF, the uncertainty of the evidence underscores the need for caution in its implementation. Future RCTs should employ rigorous methodologies, enroll sufficient participants, and use appropriate controls.","Cancer-related fatigue is a feeling of extreme tiredness that lasts for a long time. It can be caused by cancer, cancer therapy, or both. Cancer-related fatigue affects the body and mood and makes it hard to perform regular activities. It is stronger than just being tired and does not go away by resting. Clinical guidelines recommend physical exercise to improve cancer-related fatigue. Physical exercise affects cancer-related fatigue by influencing biological and psychological processes, but it is unclear what types of exercise may be most beneficial. Yoga may reduce cancer-related fatigue and improve quality of life because it combines physical movement with breath control, mental focus, and body awareness. This review explored whether yoga improves cancer-related fatigue and quality of life in adults. We also examined whether any adverse events occurred in the studies. We investigated short-term (up to 12 weeks), medium-term (12 weeks to 6 months), and long-term (more than 6 months) effects. We searched for studies comparing yoga with no yoga in adults with any cancer, including yoga done before, during, or after anticancer therapy. Multiple types of yoga were included, such as Hatha and Dru yoga. We compared and summarised the results, assessed study quality, and considered differences based on type of yoga, cancer type, format of exercise (group vs individual; supervised vs unsupervised), and participant age. We found 21 studies involving 2041 participants with various cancers, mostly women with breast cancer. Yoga was initiated during anticancer therapy in 13 studies and after therapy in eight studies; no studies examined yoga before treatment. It is unclear whether yoga during anticancer therapy improves short, medium, or long-term cancer-related fatigue. Yoga during therapy may increase short- and medium-term quality of life, but the evidence is very uncertain, and no studies measured long-term quality of life. Only one study reported adverse events, so it is unclear whether yoga affects safety outcomes. No meaningful differences were found between different yoga types, training formats, supervision levels, or cancer types. Yoga after anticancer therapy probably reduces short-term cancer-related fatigue, but its effects on medium-term fatigue are unclear, and long-term fatigue was not measured. Yoga after therapy may slightly increase short and medium-term quality of life, but evidence is very uncertain, and long-term outcomes were not assessed. It is also unclear whether yoga after therapy leads to adverse events, and no differences were found between yoga types, cancer types, or age groups. Limitations include lack of blinding, which may influence results, and small or insufficiently long studies for several outcomes. More research is needed to determine how sustainable the effects of yoga are on cancer-related fatigue, quality of life, and adverse events.",1014,Cancer-related fatigue; anticancer therapy; quality of life; adverse events; Brief Fatigue Inventory; Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory; Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30,What factors were examined to assess study quality and differences in yoga's effects?,What is the potential impact of yoga on medium-term quality of life for cancer patients?,Select the items that are animals,What was the primary focus of the study reviewed in the plain-language summary?,What uncertainty is highlighted in the evidence regarding yoga's effect on quality of life during anticancer therapy?,"Type of yoga, format of exercise, and participant age; Geographic location of studies; Financial support of participants","Type of yoga, format of exercise, and participant age",The impact is unclear due to very uncertain evidence; There is a definite significant improvement; It consistently decreases quality of life,The impact is unclear due to very uncertain evidence,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,To compare the effects of different types of yoga on weight loss; To assess the impact of yoga on cancer-related fatigue and quality of life; To examine dietary interventions for cancer patients,To assess the impact of yoga on cancer-related fatigue and quality of life,No studies assessed long-term quality of life; Yoga significantly decreases quality of life; Certainty of increased short- and medium-term quality of life,No studies assessed long-term quality of life
60712d937752fb8780e89951,interactive_3,What are the benefits and risks of vaccines for preventing COVID-19?,"Different forms of vaccines have been developed to prevent the SARS-CoV-2 virus and subsequent COVID-19 disease, and several are in widespread global use. The objective was to assess the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines, whether as a full primary series or booster dose, against SARS-CoV-2. We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and the COVID-19 LOVE platform (last search 5 November 2021), as well as the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, regulatory agency websites, and Retraction Watch. We included randomized controlled trials comparing COVID-19 vaccines with placebo, no vaccine, other active vaccines, or other vaccine schedules. Using standard Cochrane methods and GRADE for all outcomes except immunogenicity, we synthesized data for each vaccine separately and presented summary effect estimates with 95% confidence intervals. We included 41 RCTs assessing 12 vaccines, including homologous and heterologous schedules and booster doses; 32 were multicentre and five were multinational, with sample sizes ranging from 60 to 44,325 participants. Participants were aged 18 years or older in 36 RCTs, 12 years or older in one, 12 to 17 years in two, and three to 17 years in two; 29 trials included people over 60, three included immunocompromized patients, and none included pregnant women. Follow-up was ? two months in 16 RCTs, two to six months in 20, and > six to 12 months in five; 18 were preplanned interim analyses. Overall risk of bias was low for all outcomes in eight RCTs, while 33 had concerns for at least one outcome. We identified 343 registered RCTs with unavailable results. This abstract reports results for symptomatic COVID-19, severe/critical COVID-19, and serious adverse events for the 10 WHO-approved vaccines. Evidence for mortality was sparse and low or very low certainty for all vaccines except AD26.COV2.S (Janssen), which probably reduces all-cause mortality (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.67; 1 RCT, 43,783 participants; high-certainty evidence). High-certainty evidence shows that BNT162b2 (Pfizer), mRNA-1273 (Moderna), ChAdOx1 (AstraZeneca), Ad26.COV2.S, BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm-Beijing), and BBV152 (Bharat Biotech) reduce symptomatic COVID-19 compared with placebo, with vaccine efficacy ranging from about 66% to over 97% based on multiple trials. Moderate-certainty evidence shows that NVX-CoV2373 (Novavax) probably reduces symptomatic infection, while CoronaVac (Sinovac) has low-certainty evidence due to heterogeneity between its two trials. For severe or critical COVID-19, high-certainty evidence indicates that BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, Ad26.COV2.S, and BBV152 produce large reductions in severe disease, with efficacy estimates ranging from about 76% to over 98%; NVX-CoV2373 probably reduces severe disease; and two CoronaVac trials reported high efficacy but could not be pooled. For serious adverse events, mRNA-1273, ChAdOx1/SII-ChAdOx1, Ad26.COV2.S, and BBV152 probably result in little or no difference compared with placebo (RRs ranging from 0.65 to 0.92), with absolute differences fewer than 5 per 1000 participants. Evidence for SAEs is uncertain for BNT162b2, CoronaVac, BBIBP-CorV, and NVX-CoV2373 due to wide confidence intervals and low event counts. For heterologous schedules, boosters, and variant-specific efficacy, see the full review. Compared with placebo, most vaccines reduce or likely reduce symptomatic COVID-19, and several show high-certainty reductions in severe or critical disease, with probably little or no difference in serious adverse events. Over 300 registered RCTs continue to evaluate COVID-19 vaccines, and this review is regularly updated on the COVID-NMA platform. Due to trial exclusions, results cannot be generalized to pregnant women, individuals with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, or immunocompromized people; most trials had short follow-up and occurred before variants of concern emerged. Future research should evaluate long-term effects, compare vaccines and schedules, assess efficacy and safety in specific populations, include outcomes such as preventing long COVID-19, and continually monitor protection against emerging variants.","SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) is the virus that causes COVID-19 disease, and not everyone infected will develop symptoms, which can range from mild (such as fever and headaches) to life-threatening (such as difficulty breathing), or death. While vaccines work slightly differently, they all prepare the body's immune system to prevent people from getting infected with SARS-CoV-2 or, if they do get infected, to prevent severe disease. We wanted to find out how well each vaccine works in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection, symptomatic COVID-19, severe COVID-19 disease, and total deaths (including any cause), as well as serious adverse events requiring hospitalization or being life-threatening, systemic reactogenicity events (short-term immunological reactions like fever, headache, body aches, and fatigue), and any adverse events including non-serious ones. We searched for studies examining any COVID-19 vaccine compared with placebo, no vaccine, or another COVID-19 vaccine, selecting only randomized trials that evaluate interventions under ideal conditions among participants assigned by chance to different groups, and we summarized results and rated our confidence in the evidence based on study conduct. We found 41 worldwide studies involving 433,838 people assessing 12 vaccines; 35 included only healthy people who had never had COVID-19, 36 included only adults, two only adolescents, two children and adolescents, and one adolescents and adults; three involved people with weakened immune systems, and none involved pregnant women. Most studies assessed results less than six months after primary vaccination, most received co-funding from academic institutions and pharmaceutical companies, most compared a COVID-19 vaccine with placebo, and five evaluated a 'mix and match' booster. We report results for three main outcomes and for 10 WHO-approved vaccines: there is insufficient evidence regarding deaths between vaccines and placebo except for the Janssen vaccine, which probably reduces all-cause deaths. The Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Sinopharm-Beijing, and Bharat vaccines produce a large reduction in symptomatic COVID-19, Janssen reduces symptomatic cases, Novavax probably produces a large reduction, and CoronaVac has insufficient evidence because results differed between its two studies. For severe disease, Pfizer, Moderna, Janssen, and Bharat produce a large reduction, while evidence for CoronaVac is insufficient due to differing study results. For serious adverse events, Pfizer, CoronaVac, Sinopharm-Beijing, and Novavax have insufficient evidence due to low numbers of events, while Moderna, AstraZeneca, Janssen, and Bharat probably result in no or little difference in serious adverse events.

GLP-1 is an incretin, a gastrointestinal hormone that is released into the circulation in response to ingested nutrients. GLP-1 regulates glucose levels by stimulating glucose-dependent insulin secretion and biosynthesis, and by suppressing glucagon secretion, delayed gastric emptying and promoting satiety.
To assess the effects of glucagon-like peptide analogues in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Studies were obtained from electronic searches of The Cochrane Library (last search issue 1, 2011), MEDLINE (last search March 2011), EMBASE (last search March 2011), Web of Science (last search March 2011) and databases of ongoing trials.
Studies were included if they were randomised controlled trials of a minimum duration of eight weeks comparing a GLP-1 analogue with placebo, insulin, an oral anti-diabetic agent, or another GLP-1 analogue in people with type 2 diabetes.
Data extraction and quality assessment of studies were done by one reviewer and checked by a second. Data were analysed by type of GLP-1 agonist and comparison treatment. Where appropriate, data were summarised in a meta-analysis (mean differences and risk ratios summarised using a random-effects model).
Seventeen randomised controlled trials including relevant analyses for 6899 participants were included in the analysis. Studies were mostly of short duration, usually 26 weeks. In comparison with placebo, all GLP-1 agonists reduced glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels by about 1%. Exenatide 2 mg once weekly and liraglutide 1.8 mg reduced it by 0.20% and 0.24% respectively more than insulin glargine. Exenatide 2 mg once weekly reduced HbA1c more than exenatide 10 ?g twice daily, sitagliptin and pioglitazone. Liraglutide 1.8 mg reduced HbA1c by 0.33% more than exenatide 10 ?g twice daily. Liraglutide led to similar improvements in HbA1c compared to sulphonylureas but reduced it more than sitagliptin and rosiglitazone. Both exenatide and liraglutide led to greater weight loss than most active comparators, including in participants not experiencing nausea. Hypoglycaemia occurred more frequently in participants taking concomitant sulphonylurea. GLP-1 agonists caused gastrointestinal adverse effects, mainly nausea. These adverse events were strongest at the beginning and then subsided. Beta-cell function was improved with GLP-1 agonists but the effect did not persist after cessation of treatment. None of the studies was long enough to assess long-term positive or negative effects.
GLP-1 agonists are effective in improving glycaemic control.","Glucagon-like peptide analogues or agonists are a new kind of drug in the treatment of type 2 diabetes that are given by injection under the skin. They regulate glucose levels by stimulating glucose-dependent insulin secretion and biosynthesis, and by suppressing glucagon secretion, delaying gastric emptying and promoting satiety. Various glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists are in use or in the licensing process, including exenatide, liraglutide, albiglutide, taspoglutide, lixisenatide and LY2189265.
Seventeen randomised controlled trials of mostly moderate to high quality randomised approximately 6899 people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Studies were mostly of short duration, usually 26 weeks. The longest duration study was 30 weeks. Of the seventeen studies, one compared albiglutide with placebo, two compared exenatide 10µg twice daily against exenatide 2 mg once weekly, one compared exenatide 2 mg once weekly against insulin glargine, one compared exenatide 2 mg once weekly against pioglitazone and sitagliptin, five compared liraglutide with placebo, two compared liraglutide with sulphonylurea, one each compared exenatide twice daily with liraglutide, liraglutide with sitagliptin, liraglutide with rosiglitazone and liraglutide with insulin glargine, two compared taspoglutide with placebo and one each compared lixisenatide with placebo and LY2189265 with placebo. In people already treated with oral anti-diabetes drugs, addition of glucagon-like peptide analogues improved blood sugar control in comparison to placebo, rosiglitazone, pioglitazone or sitagliptin, but not always in comparison to insulin (for exenatide) or glimepiride (a sulphonylurea). Glucagon-like peptide analogous caused more weight loss than any of the comparison treatments. However, more nausea and other gastrointestinal effects such as diarrhoea or vomiting were seen, though these tended to wear off and were not seen in all participants. There was slightly more hypoglycaemia with glucagon-like analogous than with placebo, but generally less than with other anti-diabetic treatments. The incidence of hypoglycaemia occurred more frequently in participants taking concomitant sulphonylurea. The studies were not long enough to assess long-term side effects.

60712d937752fb8780e89951,interactive_4,Biosimilar monoclonal antibodies for cancer treatment in adults,"Biosimilars are products that contain an approved biological medicine and are similar, but not identical, to the original version (the originator). In cancer, biosimilars have been developed from the monoclonal antibodies bevacizumab, rituximab, and trastuzumab, and they are now available for treating lung, colorectal, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and breast cancers. Because biological products cannot be made identically, it is important to evaluate the clinical effects of biosimilars compared with their originators to understand their benefits and harms. We evaluated the benefits and harms of biosimilar monoclonal antibodies versus their originators in adults with cancer. We searched major medical and clinical trial databases up to February 2024 for randomized controlled trials comparing biosimilars to originators. Standard Cochrane methods were used. The primary outcomes were progression-free survival, duration of response, overall survival, pathological complete response in breast cancer, serious adverse events, and health-related quality of life. We included 55 studies with 22,046 adults: 23 studies of bevacizumab involving 10,639 participants with colorectal or lung cancer, 17 studies of rituximab involving 4412 participants with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 15 studies of trastuzumab involving 6995 participants with breast cancer. Studies took place worldwide, were mostly multicentre, and all were funded by manufacturers. Participants ranged in age from 47 to 62 years, and the percentage of women ranged from 18% to 100%. Fifteen studies used non-inferiority designs and 40 used equivalence designs. Overall risk of bias was low, with most concerns related to incomplete outcome data and selective reporting. For bevacizumab in lung or colorectal cancer, progression-free survival was likely similar between biosimilars and originators, with equal numbers per 1000 at 12 months and a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.00. Duration of response and overall survival were also likely similar, and serious adverse events showed no important differences. Health-related quality of life was evaluated in only one colorectal cancer study and results were similar. Objective response and mortality were likely similar as well. For rituximab in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, biosimilars were likely similar to originators for progression-free survival, duration of response, overall survival, serious adverse events, objective response, and mortality. No studies reported quality of life. For trastuzumab in breast cancer, biosimilars were likely similar to originators for progression-free survival, duration of response, overall survival, serious adverse events, and objective response, and may be similar for pathological complete response. No studies reported quality of life. Across bevacizumab, rituximab, and trastuzumab, biosimilars were generally similar to their originators in progression-free survival, duration of response, overall survival, serious adverse events, objective response, and mortality. Evidence for pathological complete response (trastuzumab) and quality of life (bevacizumab) was limited. Overall, evidence certainty was moderate, with imprecision being the main reason for downgrading confidence.","Biological medicines used in cancer treatment are made from living organisms and work by killing cancer cells. Biosimilars are medicines that are similar to the original biological medicine, known as the originator. Although biosimilars have slightly different structures, they target cancer cells in the same way. Originator medicines, sometimes called reference or innovator medicines, receive approval before biosimilars. Unlike generic medicines, which are chemically derived and easier to replicate, originators and biosimilars are biological medicines, making it more difficult to create identical copies. However, biosimilars are often cheaper and could improve access to effective cancer treatment if they provide similar benefits and harms. We wanted to compare the benefits and harms of bevacizumab, rituximab, and trastuzumab biosimilars with their originators. Based on the input from five people with cancer, we considered several outcomes critical for clinical decisions: the length of time cancer does not grow or spread after treatment, the length of time people remain cancer-free, overall survival, the number of people whose breast cancer disappears in tissue removed during surgery, severe unwanted effects, and well-being. We also identified outcomes important for decision-making: the number of people whose cancer shrinks or disappears, death, and the time until cancer grows or spreads or until death. We searched for studies comparing biosimilars of bevacizumab, rituximab, or trastuzumab with the originators in people with lung, colorectal, non-Hodkin's lymphoma, and breast cancers, summarized the results, and rated our confidence in the evidence. We found 55 studies with 22,046 participants, including 10,639 receiving bevacizumab for advanced or metastatic lung cancer, 4412 receiving rituximab mainly for non-Hodkin's lymphoma, and 6995 receiving trastuzumab for advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Participants were 47 to 62 years old on average, and the studies took place across Asia, Europe, and North and South America. All studies were funded by the companies manufacturing the biosimilars. Receiving biosimilars or originator medicines led to similar results overall, and we are moderately confident that biosimilars are as effective as the originators in treating cancer. We set narrow criteria to judge whether results were sufficiently similar, and while most comparisons did not fall fully within this range, overall findings still support similarity. Most studies were well conducted, but a few may have allowed participants to know which treatment they received, and some studies did not report all outcomes of interest.",1018,biosilimars; biological medicine; bevacizumab; rituximab; trastuzumab; progression-free survival; duration of response; overall survival; serious adverse events; health-related quality of life,In what way do biosimilars demonstrate their therapeutic value compared to originators?,How could a decision-maker justify the use of biosimilars in cancer treatment?,Select all of the following that are colors,Name the three monoclonal antibodies mentioned that have biosimilars.,Describe the types of cancer involved in the studies comparing biosimilars and originators.,By showing adequately similar outcomes in critical measures for decision-making.; By providing completely different benefits that improve treatment options.; By achieving perfect replication of all outcomes observed with originators.,By showing adequately similar outcomes in critical measures for decision-making.,By arguing that biosimilars provide a moderate increase in life expectancy.; By highlighting their overall similar effectiveness and lower cost.; By pointing to their identical molecular composition to originators.,By highlighting their overall similar effectiveness and lower cost.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Bevacizumab; Rituximab; Trastuzumab,Bevacizumab; Rituximab; Trastuzumab,"Lung, colorectal, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and breast cancers.; Prostate and skin cancers.; Bone and stomach cancers.","Lung, colorectal, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and breast cancers."
60712d937752fb8780e89951,finetuned_5,Immunosuppressive treatment for focal segmental glomerulosclerosis in adults,"Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) can result from primary, genetic, or secondary causes; primary disease typically leads to nephrotic syndrome, while genetic and secondary forms may present with asymptomatic proteinuria or with nephrotic syndrome. Only about 20% of patients achieve partial or complete remission with treatment, and roughly half progress to kidney failure. This updated review assessed treatments for adults with FSGS and included 15 studies with 560 participants, all of whom had steroid-resistant disease since no trials evaluated corticosteroids versus placebo despite guidelines recommending steroids as first-line therapy. Five studies compared cyclosporin, with or without prednisone, to various treatments including no specific therapy, prednisone, methylprednisolone, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and dexamethasone. Other small single trials evaluated monoclonal antibodies such as adalimumab and fresolimumab, rituximab versus tacrolimus, cyclosporin plus valsartan versus cyclosporin alone, MMF versus prednisone, chlorambucil with steroids versus no treatment, different dexamethasone regimens, CCX140-B versus placebo, and one larger study compared sparsentan to irbesartan. Evidence for cyclosporin suggested it may increase the likelihood of complete remission and of combined complete or partial remission, though results were imprecise and based on few small trials. Cyclosporin showed little to no difference in preventing chronic kidney disease progression or kidney failure, and its effects on hypertension or infection remained uncertain. MMF appeared to offer little or no difference compared to prednisone for remission outcomes or kidney function, and most other interventions had very low certainty evidence, preventing firm conclusions. It is also uncertain whether sparsentan reduces proteinuria more effectively than irbesartan. Overall, no trials evaluated the recommended first-line therapy of corticosteroids, and the available evidence applies only to steroid-resistant FSGS. Cyclosporin may improve remission rates when given for at least six months, but confidence in these findings is limited by the small size and variability of the studies. Future trials must more clearly define patient populations distinguishing primary, genetic, and secondary FSGS to support stronger treatment recommendations.","Nephrotic syndrome is a condition where the kidneys leak protein from the blood into the urine. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) defined on kidney biopsy is an uncommon cause of nephrotic syndrome disease but it progresses to kidney failure in about half of all cases. It can be divided into three groups - primary FSGS (thought to be due to a factor circulating in the blood that damages the kidneys), genetic (secondary to mutations in one or more genes), and secondary to other causes, including certain infections. Treatments aim to reduce the amount of protein in the urine completely or partly to increase the time before kidney failure develops.
We looked at all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which examined therapy with prednisone or other agents which affect the immune system such as cyclosporin and mycophenolate mofetil and other agents with or without steroid therapy. We found 15 studies involving 553 participants. In five studies cyclosporin was compared with different treatments. Combining four studies (231 participants) showed that cyclosporin was more effective than these other treatments in achieving complete remission of nephrotic syndrome. The studies were too small and lasted for too short a time to determine if cyclosporin reduced the risk of kidney failure. Nine small studies examined different medicines that suppress the body's immune system. None of these treatments reduced the amount of protein in the urine.
We found limited information that cyclosporin may reduce the amount of protein in the urine in some people with FSGS but the data are uncertain because the studies enrolled too few participants.

60712d937752fb8780e89951,finetuned_6,Treatment options for people with recurrent and progressive glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly malignant brain tumour that almost always progresses or recurs after standard first-line treatment, and there is no consensus on the most effective therapy once the disease returns. This review evaluated available treatments for first and later recurrence in people previously treated with the standard Stupp protocol and included a brief economic commentary. Searches of major medical databases up to December 2019 identified 42 eligible studies (34 randomised trials and 8 non-randomised studies) involving 5236 participants. Most randomised trials had low risk of bias, while non-randomised studies had high risk of bias. Treatments included chemotherapy, re-operation, re-irradiation, and novel therapies used alone or in combination. For first recurrence, 11 treatments contributed to the overall survival network analysis and eight to the progression-free survival analysis, with lomustine (LOM/CCNU) used as the reference treatment. No included studies in the network meta-analysis evaluated surgery, re-irradiation, PCV, temozolomide (TMZ) rechallenge, or best supportive care, and quality-of-life data were sparse. Median overall survival ranged from 5.5 to 12.6 months and median progression-free survival from 1.5 to 4.2 months. No high-certainty evidence showed any treatment improved survival compared with lomustine. Bevacizumab plus lomustine probably resulted in little or no difference in survival compared with lomustine alone, though it may improve progression-free survival. Bevacizumab alone may offer little or no survival benefit, and evidence remains uncertain. Regorafenib may improve overall survival compared with lomustine but evidence certainty was low. Temozolomide plus Depatux-M (ABT414) may improve survival compared with lomustine or bevacizumab, possibly driven by the temozolomide component, but additional evidence is needed. Fotemustine may have similar effects to lomustine. Evidence for bevacizumab plus irinotecan was very uncertain, and it likely offers little benefit over bevacizumab alone. Ranking analyses placed fotemustine first, followed by bevacizumab plus lomustine, lomustine alone, bevacizumab plus irinotecan, and bevacizumab alone, though ranking does not reflect evidence certainty. Three studies examining re-operation suggested it may extend survival in carefully selected patients. One early-phase study suggested a potential role for a cannabinoid plus temozolomide. Evidence for treatment of second or later recurrence was limited; some heterogeneous studies suggested radiotherapy with or without bevacizumab may improve survival, while tumour-treating fields showed little difference compared with physician's choice. No reliable evidence was found for best supportive care. Severe adverse events were significantly more common with bevacizumab plus lomustine than with lomustine alone and were similarly high with cediranib plus lomustine. Lomustine alone had the lowest rate of severe adverse events, followed by regorafenib. Combinations that added novel agents to bevacizumab generally increased toxicity. Overall, combination treatments for first recurrence did not improve survival compared with lomustine monotherapy and were often associated with more severe adverse events. Re-operation and re-irradiation may benefit selected individuals. Evidence for later recurrences remains sparse, and more high-quality research is needed.","Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a very aggressive brain tumour that often continues to grow even after surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, and almost always comes back. Many different treatments have been tested for tumour progression or recurrence, but there is no agreement on which option is best. This review evaluated treatments for people whose GBM progressed or recurred after receiving standard initial care. A total of 42 studies involving 5236 people were included. Treatments examined included chemotherapy, re-operation, re-irradiation, and newer therapies used alone or in combination. For first recurrence, none of the treatments showed clear evidence of being better than lomustine (CCNU). Adding bevacizumab to lomustine did not improve overall survival, and most other agents either had uncertain benefits or did not improve outcomes. Several commonly used treatments such as PCV and temozolomide re-challenge were not represented in the available evidence. Limited evidence suggested that a second surgery, with or without additional therapies, may offer some survival benefit in selected individuals. For second or later recurrence, evidence was too limited for statistical analysis, but radiotherapy with or without bevacizumab might offer some benefit, though this is uncertain. Serious side effects occurred with many treatments, and combining bevacizumab with lomustine resulted in more severe adverse events than lomustine alone. Overall, lomustine appears to be the most effective chemotherapy option for first recurrence, and other combination therapies generally carried higher risks without clear benefits. A second surgery or radiotherapy may be helpful for some individuals. For later recurrences, evidence is sparse and uncertain.

60712d937752fb8780e89951,finetuned_6,Does taxation of unprocessed sugar or foods with added sugar reduce their consumption and prevent obesity or other adverse health outcomes?,"Global prevalence of overweight and obesity are alarming. For tackling this public health problem, preventive public health and policy actions are urgently needed. Some countries implemented food taxes in the past and some were subsequently abolished. Some countries, such as Norway, Hungary, Denmark, Bermuda, Dominica, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and the Navajo Nation (USA), specifically implemented taxes on unprocessed sugar and sugar-added foods. These taxes on unprocessed sugar and sugar-added foods are fiscal policy interventions, implemented to decrease their consumption and in turn reduce adverse health-related, economic and social effects associated with these food products. To assess the effects of taxation of unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods in the general population on the consumption of unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods, the prevalence and incidence of overweight and obesity, and the prevalence and incidence of other diet-related health outcomes. We searched CENTRAL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, Embase and 15 other databases and trials registers on 12 September 2019. We handsearched the reference list of all records of included studies, searched websites of international organisations and institutions, and contacted review advisory group members to identify planned, ongoing or unpublished studies. We included studies with the following populations: children (0 to 17 years) and adults (18 years or older) from any country and setting. Exclusion applied to studies with specific subgroups, such as people with any disease who were overweight or obese as a side-effect of the disease. The review included studies with taxes on or artificial increases of selling prices for unprocessed sugar or food products that contain added sugar (e.g. sweets, ice cream, confectionery, and bakery products), or both, as intervention, regardless of the taxation level or price increase. In line with Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) criteria, we included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-randomised controlled trials (cRCTs), non-randomised controlled trials (nRCTs), controlled before-after (CBA) studies, and interrupted time series (ITS) studies. We included controlled studies with more than one intervention or control site and ITS studies with a clearly defined intervention time and at least three data points before and three after the intervention. Our primary outcomes were consumption of unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods, energy intake, overweight, and obesity. Our secondary outcomes were substitution and diet, expenditure, demand, and other health outcomes. Two review authors independently screened all eligible records for inclusion, assessed the risk of bias, and performed data extraction.Two review authors independently assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We retrieved a total of 24,454 records. After deduplicating records, 18,767 records remained for title and abstract screening. Of 11 potentially relevant studies, we included one ITS study with 40,210 household-level observations from the Hungarian Household Budget and Living Conditions Survey. The baseline ranged from January 2008 to August 2011, the intervention was implemented on September 2011, and follow-up was until December 2012 (16 months). The intervention was a tax - the so-called 'Hungarian public health product tax' - on sugar-added foods, including selected foods exceeding a specific sugar threshold value. The intervention includes co-interventions: the taxation of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) and of foods high in salt or caffeine. The study provides evidence on the effect of taxing foods exceeding a specific sugar threshold value on the consumption of sugar-added foods. After implementation of the Hungarian public health product tax, the mean consumption of taxed sugar-added foods (measured in units of kg) decreased by 4.0% (standardised mean difference (SMD) ?0.040, 95% confidence interval (CI) ?0.07 to ?0.01; very low-certainty evidence). The study was at low risk of bias in terms of performance bias, detection bias and reporting bias, with the shape of effect pre-specified and the intervention unlikely to have any effect on data collection. The study was at unclear risk of attrition bias and at high risk in terms of other bias and the independence of the intervention. We rated the certainty of the evidence as very low for the primary and secondary outcomes. The Hungarian public health product tax included a tax on sugar-added foods but did not include a tax on unprocessed sugar. We did not find eligible studies reporting on the taxation of unprocessed sugar. No studies reported on the primary outcomes of consumption of unprocessed sugar, energy intake, overweight, and obesity. No studies reported on the secondary outcomes of substitution and diet, demand, and other health outcomes. No studies reported on differential effects across population subgroups. We could not perform meta-analyses or pool study results. There was very limited evidence and the certainty of the evidence was very low. Despite the reported reduction in consumption of taxed sugar-added foods, we are uncertain whether taxing unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods has an effect on reducing their consumption and preventing obesity or other adverse health outcomes. Further robustly conducted studies are required to draw concrete conclusions on the effectiveness of taxing unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods for reducing their consumption and preventing obesity or other adverse health outcomes.","As outlined by the World Health Organization, 'globesity' (the rise in overweight and obesity globally) is a major world challenge. A sugar-rich diet, especially when combined with physical inactivity, may cause overweight and obesity, and other harmful health outcomes. There are direct costs to healthcare services of people being overweight or obese, such as preventing and treating health problems that this causes. There are also costs to society as a whole when people who are ill through being overweight or obese are unable to work. This review may be of interest to government public health agencies, policy decision-makers, food retailers, and food industries. This review and subsequent updates of this review may change policy and affect a government's motivation to create a tax on unprocessed sugar and foods with added sugar. It also may motivate food industries to reformulate their products to contain lower levels of added sugar. We wanted to know if taxation of unprocessed sugar and foods with added sugar (other than sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs)) reduced their consumption, changed people's energy intake, and reduced overweight and obesity. We also wanted to know if taxation changed people's diet and spending, and had an effect on other diet-related health problems. We searched for ongoing or published studies up to October 2019. Of a total of 24,454 records retrieved, we identified one 'interrupted time series' (ITS) study meeting our eligibility criteria to assess the impact of a tax on sugar-added foods (but not unprocessed sugar). The study used data from the Hungarian Household Budget and Living Conditions Survey, with observations from 40,210 households. Evidence from the study included a 'baseline' (the situation before taxation), ranging from January 2008 to August 2011. The Hungarian public health product tax was implemented on September 2011. The duration of the follow-up period (measuring the effects of taxation) was 16 months. The study was funded by the Scottish Institute for Research in Economics (SIRE) Early Career Engagement Grant. The included study provided very limited evidence that taxing foods with added sugar reduced their consumption by 4%. We are very uncertain about this evidence because the study did not use the strongest methods, looked at other kinds of taxation as well as taxing foods with added sugar, and may not have correctly classified food types. We are uncertain whether taxing foods with added sugar has an effect on reducing their consumption. The included study did not investigate the effects of taxing unprocessed sugar. Further research is needed to assess the effectiveness of taxing unprocessed sugar or foods with added sugar for reducing their consumption and preventing obesity or other adverse health outcomes. Studies should take place in countries that have implemented these taxes and should look at cost-effectiveness as well as the health benefits of taxing unprocessed sugar or foods with added sugar as a public health policy for preventing overweight, obesity or other adverse health outcomes.

5f111456d672e8471ca03f46,static_1,Long-term treatment for people with persistent depression,"Persistent depressive disorder (PDD) is defined as a depressive disorder with a minimum illness duration of two years, including four diagnostic subgroups (dysthymia, chronic major depression, recurrent major depression with incomplete remission between episodes, and double depression), and persistent forms of depression represent a substantial proportion of depressive disorders, with a lifetime prevalence ranging from 3% to 6% in the Western world; growing evidence indicates that PDD responds well to several acute interventions, such as combined psychological and pharmacological treatments, yet given the high rates of relapse and recurrences of depression following response to acute treatment, long-term continuation and maintenance therapy are of great importance, and to date there has been no evidence synthesis available on continuation and maintenance treatments of PDDs. The aim of this review was to assess the effects of pharmacological and psychological (either alone or combined) continuation and maintenance treatments for persistent depressive disorder, in comparison with each other, placebo (drug/attention placebo/non-specific treatment control), and treatment as usual (TAU), with continuation treatments defined as treatments given to currently remitted people (remission is defined as depressive symptoms dropping below case level) or to people who previously responded to an antidepressant treatment, and maintenance therapy given during recovery (defined as remission lasting longer than six months). We searched Ovid MEDLINE (1950- ), Embase (1974- ), PsycINFO (1967- ) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to 28 September 2018, with an earlier search of these databases also conducted via the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trial Register (CCMD-CTR) to 11 December 2015; in addition we searched grey literature resources, ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP to 28 September 2018, screened reference lists of included studies, and contacted the first author of included studies. We included randomized (RCTs) and non-randomized controlled trials (NRCTs) in adults with formally diagnosed PDD, receiving pharmacological, psychological, or combined continuation and maintenance interventions. Two review authors independently selected studies and extracted and analyzed data; the primary efficacy outcome was relapse/recurrence rate of depression, and the primary acceptance outcome was dropout due to any reason other than relapse/recurrence; we performed random-effects meta-analyses using risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We included 10 studies (seven RCTs, three NRCTs) involving 840 participants, with five studies investigating continuation treatments and five investigating maintenance treatments; overall, the included studies were at low-to-moderate risk of bias, with the most common source of risk of bias in NRCTs being selection of reported results, and in RCTs non-blinding of outcome assessment and other bias (especially conflict of interest due to pharmaceutical sponsoring). The most common comparison was antidepressant medication versus tablet placebo (five studies), and participants taking antidepressant medication were probably less likely to relapse or to experience a recurrent episode compared to participants in the placebo group at the end of the intervention (13.9% versus 33.8%, RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.79; participants = 383; studies = 4;  I²  = 54%, moderate quality evidence); overall dropout rates may be similar between participants in the medication and placebo group (23.0% versus 25.5%, RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.39 to 2.11; RCTs = 4; participants = 386;  I²  = 64%, low quality evidence), although sensitivity analyses showed that the primary outcome (rate of relapse/recurrence) showed no evidence of a difference between groups when only including studies with low risk of bias. None of the studies compared pharmacological or psychological treatments versus TAU. One study compared psychological therapies versus attention placebo/non-specific control, and one study compared psychotherapy with medication; the results of the studies including psychotherapy might indicate that continued or maintained psychotherapy could be a useful intervention compared to no treatment or antidepressant medication, but the body of evidence for these comparisons was too small and uncertain to draw high quality conclusions. Three studies compared combined psychological and pharmacological therapies with pharmacological therapies alone, and one study compared combined psychological and pharmacological therapies with psychotherapeutic therapies alone; however, the evidence was too small and uncertain to draw any high quality conclusions. Two studies reported data on the direct comparison of two antidepressants, but again the evidence was too small and uncertain to draw conclusions. Currently, it is uncertain whether continued or maintained pharmacotherapy (or both) with the reviewed antidepressant agents is a robust treatment for preventing relapse and recurrence in people with PDD due to moderate or high risk of bias as well as clinical heterogeneity in the analyzed studies; for all other comparisons, the body of evidence was too small to draw any final conclusions, although continued or maintained psychotherapy might be effective compared to no treatment. There is a need for more high quality trials of psychological interventions, and further studies should address health-related quality of life and adverse events more precisely, as well as assessing follow-up data.","Depressive disorders that persist for at least two years cause considerable problems; even after successful treatment, they frequently recur, and common treatments are antidepressant medicines and psychological treatments (talking therapies), or a combination of both, with long-term treatments intended to prevent the recurrence of depressive symptoms. People with persisting depression (longer than two years), friends, families, and carers, as well as general practitioners, psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, psychological therapists, and pharmacists, will be interested in this review. In adults with persistent depression who improved with acute (short-term) treatment, the review aimed to determine whether receiving continued antidepressant medicine, psychological treatment, or a combination of both is more effective in preventing recurrence of depression compared to placebo (a pretended treatment) or care as usual; whether receiving continued antidepressant medicine, psychological treatment, or a combination of both is equally accepted as receiving placebo or usual care; and whether one treatment is more effective or more accepted than another. We searched medical databases and other sources to find all relevant studies completed up to September 2018, and the studies had to compare antidepressant treatment, psychological treatment, or a combination of both, with each other, with placebo, or with care as usual for preventing recurrence of depression in adults diagnosed with persistent depression; we included 10 studies involving 840 participants. Five studies compared antidepressant medicine with placebo; one study compared psychological therapies versus attention placebo/non-specific control; one study compared psychotherapy with medication; three studies compared combined psychological and pharmacological therapies with pharmacological therapies alone; one study compared combined psychological and pharmacological therapies with psychotherapeutic therapies alone; and two studies compared two different antidepressants with each other. Overall, the included studies were at low-to-moderate risk of bias. According to GRADE, there was moderate quality evidence that participants taking medication treatment probably had less relapses/recurrences and may have lower dropouts than those taking placebo; the risk of depression returning in participants receiving a placebo (instead of antidepressant medicine) was 34%, whereas participants who remained on antidepressant medicines had a lower risk for recurrence of 13%, with continued treatment lasting between four months and two years. Antidepressants were as well accepted as placebo; however, as most of the included studies showed risk of bias and there were some inconsistent results between the different studies, it cannot be concluded with certainty whether continued or maintained pharmacotherapy (or both) is a convincing treatment for people with PDD. Additionally, as studies on the long-term effects of medication are lacking, recommendations on the necessary duration of medication treatment cannot be drawn. The benefits of psychological therapies or combined treatment remained unclear due to the small number of studies. This review cannot provide clear, certain evidence regarding whether continued antidepressant medication (compared to placebo tablet) reduces the risk of depression recurring in adults with persistent depression; however, only a few studies have been done, and further studies should especially address psychological and combined long-term treatments.",1116,Persistent depressive disorder; acute interventions; remission; continuation and maintenance therapy; psychotherapy,What might be the implications of the study's findings for the long-term management of persistent depressive disorder (PDD)?,What is the primary focus of the study?,Select all of the following that are fruits,Which treatments were compared in the study?,How are long-term treatments intended to benefit patients with persistent depression?,Continued antidepressant medication offers a definitive solution to prevent recurrence.; Psychotherapy could potentially be more effective but requires further research.; There is uncertainty regarding the efficacy of combined treatments due to limited data.,Psychotherapy could potentially be more effective but requires further research.; There is uncertainty regarding the efficacy of combined treatments due to limited data.,Assessing continuation and maintenance treatments for persistent depression; Investigating new antidepressant medications; Studying short-term interventions for depression,Assessing continuation and maintenance treatments for persistent depression,dog; blue; grape,grape,Antidepressant medications versus placebo; Psychological therapies versus attention placebo; Lifestyle interventions versus exercise,Antidepressant medications versus placebo; Psychological therapies versus attention placebo,Preventing recurrence of depressive symptoms; Eliminating depressive symptoms completely; Providing immediate relief from symptoms,Preventing recurrence of depressive symptoms
5f111456d672e8471ca03f46,static_2,Bezafibrate for primary biliary cirrhosis,"Treatment of primary biliary cirrhosis is complicated, and although some studies suggest that bezafibrate, alone or with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), may be effective, no systematic review had summarised the evidence. This review assessed the beneficial and harmful effects of bezafibrate in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. Searches of multiple databases including the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP were conducted up to late 2011, along with Chinese databases up to January 2011, and manufacturers and authors were contacted. All randomised clinical trials comparing bezafibrate at any dose or regimen with placebo, no intervention, or another drug were included, allowing concomitant interventions if equally applied to all groups. Two authors extracted data, and analyses used risk ratios or risk differences for dichotomous data, mean differences for continuous data, and trial sequential analysis to assess random errors. Six trials with 151 Japanese patients were included, all at high risk of bias; four trials compared bezafibrate plus UDCA with no intervention plus UDCA, and two compared bezafibrate with UDCA. No patients died or developed liver-related complications. Bezafibrate had no significant effect on adverse events compared with no intervention (5/32 vs 0/28; RR 5.40, 95% CI 0.69 to 42.32) or UDCA (2/32 vs 0/37; RR 6.19, 95% CI 0.31 to 122.05). Bezafibrate significantly reduced serum alkaline phosphatase activity compared with no intervention (MD -186.04 U/L, 95% CI -249.03 to -123.04) and compared with UDCA (MD -162.90 U/L, 95% CI -199.68 to -126.12), with results supported by trial sequential analyses. Compared with no intervention, bezafibrate also significantly reduced plasma immunoglobulin M (MD -164.00 mg/dl, 95% CI -259.47 to -68.53) and serum bilirubin (MD -0.19 mg/dl, 95% CI -0.38 to -0.00), though these two findings were not supported by trial sequential analyses. Bezafibrate showed no significant effect on serum gamma-glutamyltransferase or alanine aminotransferase compared with no intervention. Compared with UDCA, bezafibrate showed no significant effects on these enzymes or immunoglobulin M in random-effects models, but fixed-effect models suggested significant decreases in all three markers. One patient discontinued bezafibrate due to an adverse event. Overall, bezafibrate showed no effect on mortality, liver-related morbidity, adverse events, or pruritus compared with no intervention or UDCA, and none of the trials assessed quality of life or fatigue. Although bezafibrate may improve some liver biochemical measures, these findings may reflect bias or random error. More rigorous randomised clinical trials are needed.","Primary biliary cirrhosis is a chronic disease of the liver that is characterised by progressive inflammation and destruction of the liver tissue, eventually progressing to liver cirrhosis and the need for liver transplantation. Primary biliary cirrhosis primarily affects middle-aged women. Bezafibrate is a hypolipidaemic agent used in treatment of hypertriglyceridaemia. There are studies suggesting that bezafibrate, alone or in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid, is effective in treatment of primary biliary cirrhosis. Mechanisms through which bezafibrate improves lipid serum concentration balance and prevents biliary cell damage still need to be fully understood. This review evaluates all data on the benefits and harms of bezafibrate for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis in randomised clinical trials. The findings of this review are based on six randomised clinical trials with 151 Japanese patients. Bezafibrate was compared with no intervention in four trials (with co-intervention of ursodeoxycholic acid in both the bezafibrate and control groups) and with ursodeoxycholic acid in two trials. The primary findings of the review are that bezafibrate has no statistically significant effects on mortality, liver-related morbidity, adverse events, and quality of life of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. A possible positive intervention effect of bezafibrate versus no intervention on liver biochemistry measures can be real but could also be due to systematic errors or random errors. The benefits and harms of bezafibrate for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis need further assessment in randomised clinical trials comparing bezafibrate with placebo. Such trials ought to be conducted with impeccable methodology to reduce the risks of random errors and sufficiently large patient groups to reduce the risks of random errors.",1096,bezafibrate; primary biliary cirrhosis; ursodeoxycholic acid; liver-related complications; plasma immunoglobulin M; serum bilirubin; serum gamma-glutamyltransferase; alanine aminotransferase; liver biochemical measures; pruritus,What are the primary motivations for conducting a systematic review on bezafibrate in primary biliary cirrhosis?,How could the findings of this review affect future research directions in liver treatment?,Select all of the following that are colors,How should the potential for systematic or random errors influence the interpretation of bezafibrateÃ¢ÂÂs effects?,What did the trials compare bezafibrate with?,To consolidate existing evidence from scattered studies; To develop new treatment protocols; To address the lack of definitive conclusions regarding its efficacy,To consolidate existing evidence from scattered studies; To address the lack of definitive conclusions regarding its efficacy,By discouraging further trials on bezafibrate; By highlighting the need for rigorously conducted trials; By confirming the current clinical guidelines,By highlighting the need for rigorously conducted trials,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,It should be considered as a major limitation in assessing benefits; It validates the significance of the findings; It suggests that bezafibrate's benefits are entirely due to error,It should be considered as a major limitation in assessing benefits,No intervention and ursodeoxycholic acid; Placebo and vitamins; Dietary changes only,No intervention and ursodeoxycholic acid
5f111456d672e8471ca03f46,static_2,Do physical measures such as hand-washing or wearing masks stop or slow down the spread of respiratory viruses?,"Viral epidemics or pandemics of acute respiratory infections (ARIs) pose a global threat, such as the influenza (H1N1) pandemic in 2009 caused by the H1N1pdm09 virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 in 2019, and antiviral drugs and vaccines may be insufficient to prevent their spread; this is an update of a Cochrane Review last published in 2020 and includes results from studies conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. The objective was to assess the effectiveness of physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of acute respiratory viruses. We searched CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and two trials registers in October 2022, with backward and forward citation analysis. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-RCTs investigating physical interventions (screening at entry ports, isolation, quarantine, physical distancing, personal protection, hand hygiene, face masks, glasses, and gargling) to prevent respiratory virus transmission, and used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We included 11 new RCTs and cluster-RCTs (610,872 participants), bringing the total to 78; six were conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic (two from Mexico, and one each from Denmark, Bangladesh, England, and Norway), and we identified four ongoing studies, one completed but unreported, evaluating masks during COVID-19. Many studies were conducted during non-epidemic influenza periods, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, or influenza seasons up to 2016, meaning many occurred under lower viral circulation compared with COVID-19; settings varied widely, from suburban schools to hospital wards in high-income countries, crowded inner-city areas in low-income countries, and an immigrant neighbourhood in a high-income country, and adherence to interventions was low in many studies, with risk of bias mostly high or unclear. We included 12 trials comparing medical/surgical masks versus no masks (two in healthcare workers and 10 in the community); wearing masks in the community probably makes little or no difference in influenza-like illness/COVID-like illness compared to not wearing masks (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.09; 9 trials, 276,917 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and probably makes little or no difference in laboratory-confirmed influenza/SARS-CoV-2 (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.42; 6 trials, 13,919 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), with harms rarely measured. For N95/P2 respirators compared to medical/surgical masks, pooled trials (four in healthcare settings and one in a household) show very uncertain effects on clinical respiratory illness (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.10; 3 trials, 7779 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and they may be effective for ILI (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.03; 5 trials, 8407 participants; low-certainty evidence); for laboratory-confirmed influenza, N95/P2 respirators probably make little or no difference (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.34; 5 trials, 8407 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Restricting analyses to healthcare workers made no difference; harms were poorly measured, though discomfort was reported. One recently published RCT found medical/surgical masks non-inferior to N95 respirators in 1009 healthcare workers across four countries treating COVID-19 patients. For hand hygiene, 19 trials compared interventions with controls across schools, childcare centres, and homes; hand hygiene resulted in a 14% relative reduction in ARIs (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.90; 9 trials, 52,105 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), reducing cases from 380 to 327 per 1000 people. For ILI (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.09; 11 trials, 34,503 participants; low-certainty evidence) and laboratory-confirmed influenza (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.30; 8 trials, 8332 participants; low-certainty evidence), effects suggested little or no difference. Pooled data from 19 trials (71,210 participants) for ARI/ILI/influenza found hand hygiene may be beneficial with an 11% relative reduction (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.94; low-certainty evidence), though with high heterogeneity; harms were rarely reported. No RCTs were found for gowns and gloves, face shields, or screening at entry ports. The high risk of bias, variation in outcome measurement, and low adherence hinder firm conclusions; additional RCTs during the pandemic existed but were relatively few despite the importance of evaluating masking and adherence, especially in vulnerable groups. There remains uncertainty about the effects of face masks, with low to moderate certainty meaning confidence is limited and true effects may differ; pooled RCTs did not show a clear reduction in respiratory viral infection with medical/surgical masks, and no clear difference was seen between medical/surgical masks and N95/P2 respirators in healthcare workers providing routine care. Hand hygiene is likely to modestly reduce respiratory illness, though not significantly for ILI or laboratory-confirmed influenza. Harms were under-investigated. There is a need for large, well-designed RCTs across multiple settings and populations to evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions and the impact of adherence, especially among those at highest risk of ARIs.","Respiratory viruses are viruses that infect the cells in your airways: nose, throat, and lungs and these infections can cause serious problems and affect normal breathing, leading to illnesses such as flu (influenza), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and COVID-19. People infected with a respiratory virus spread virus particles into the air when they cough or sneeze, and others become infected if they come into contact with these particles in the air or on surfaces; respiratory viruses can spread quickly through communities, populations, countries (causing epidemics), and around the world (causing pandemics). Physical measures to try to prevent respiratory viruses spreading include washing hands often; not touching your eyes, nose, or mouth; sneezing or coughing into your elbow; wiping surfaces with disinfectant; wearing masks, eye protection, gloves, and gowns; avoiding contact with other people (isolation or quarantine); keeping a distance from others; and screening people entering a country for signs of infection. We wanted to find out whether physical measures stop or slow the spread of respiratory viruses from well-controlled randomised controlled trials comparing one intervention to another. We searched for randomised controlled studies that looked at physical measures to stop people acquiring a respiratory virus infection and were interested in how many people caught a respiratory virus infection and whether the physical measures had unwanted effects. We identified 78 relevant studies conducted in low-, middle-, and high-income countries in hospitals, schools, homes, offices, childcare centres, and communities during non-epidemic influenza periods, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, influenza seasons up to 2016, and during the COVID-19 pandemic; five ongoing, unpublished studies were found, two evaluating masks for COVID-19, with five trials funded by government and pharmaceutical companies, and nine funded by pharmaceutical companies. No studies looked at face shields, gowns and gloves, or screening at borders. We assessed the effects of medical or surgical masks, N95/P2 respirators (close-fitting masks filtering inhaled air, mostly used by healthcare workers), and hand hygiene (hand-washing or hand sanitiser). For medical or surgical masks, ten studies took place in the community and two in healthcare workers; compared with wearing no mask (community studies only), wearing a mask may make little to no difference in how many people caught a flu-like or COVID-like illness (9 studies; 276,917 people), and probably makes little or no difference in how many had flu or COVID confirmed by a lab test (6 studies; 13,919 people), with discomfort rarely reported. For N95/P2 respirators, four studies were in healthcare workers and one small study in the community; compared with wearing surgical masks, N95/P2 respirators probably make little to no difference in confirmed flu (5 studies; 8407 people) and may make little to no difference in flu-like illness (5 studies; 8407 people) or respiratory illness (3 studies; 7799 people), with discomfort mentioned. For hand hygiene, following a hand hygiene programme may reduce respiratory or flu-like illness or confirmed flu compared with no programme (19 studies; 71,210 people), although the reduction was not statistically confirmed when ILI and lab-confirmed ILI were analysed separately; few studies measured unwanted effects, with skin irritation from sanitiser mentioned. Our confidence in these results is generally low to moderate for subjective outcomes such as respiratory illness, but moderate for more precise laboratory-confirmed infection outcomes related to masks and N95/P2 respirators; results may change with more evidence, and adherence to mask-wearing and hand hygiene was relatively low, which may have affected study outcomes.",1111,acute respiratory infections (ARIs); SARS-CoV-2; H1N1pdm09 virus; severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS); N95/P2 respirators; laboratory-confirmed influenza; influenza-like illness (ILI); physical interventions; antiviral drugs; viral epidemics,What can be deduced about the effectiveness of physical interventions such as masks in different settings from the studyÃ¢ÂÂs findings?,What criteria can be used to evaluate the reliability of the study's conclusions about the use of hand hygiene?,Select all of the following that are fruits,What are the implications of the studyÃ¢ÂÂs findings for the future design of respiratory virus prevention trials?,How could the limited findings on harms associated with interventions impact public health policies?,Masks show consistent effectiveness across all settings.; Effectiveness of masks is inconsistent across different settings.; Masks are ineffective in low-income settings.,Effectiveness of masks is inconsistent across different settings.,The number of trials and participants involved in the hand hygiene studies.; The consistency of outcomes across different respiratory diseases.; The number of different viruses tested in isolation settings only.,The number of trials and participants involved in the hand hygiene studies.; The consistency of outcomes across different respiratory diseases.,dog; blue; grape,grape,Designing trials with a focus on heterogeneous settings and high adherence to interventions.; Excluding healthcare worker settings to focus on community settings only.; Including a wider range of physical interventions besides masks and hand hygiene.,Designing trials with a focus on heterogeneous settings and high adherence to interventions.; Including a wider range of physical interventions besides masks and hand hygiene.,Policies may proceed cautiously due to potential undisclosed harms.; Limited harm reporting justifies the unrestricted use of interventions.; It necessitates further research to guide evidence-based policy decisions.,Policies may proceed cautiously due to potential undisclosed harms.; It necessitates further research to guide evidence-based policy decisions.
5f111456d672e8471ca03f46,interactive_3,Is semaglutide an effective weight-loss treatment for adults living with obesity and does it cause unwanted effects?,"To assess the effects of semaglutide on adults living with obesity. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and two trials registries. The latest search date was 17 December 2024.
Semaglutide results in a clinically relevant weight loss at medium-term follow-up compared to placebo, which is likely to be sustained in the long term, while taking the drug. While semaglutide increases the risk of adverse events leading to withdrawal, it appears to be of limited clinical relevance in absolute terms at medium-term, and clinically relevant at long-term follow-up. The effects of semaglutide on quality of life, MACE, and mortality are likely limited or uncertain. Most studies were funded by the drug's manufacturer, raising important concerns about conflicts of interest. We identified 46 ongoing studies that may strengthen future evidence syntheses. Further independent studies are needed, particularly in underrepresented populations, to better understand the broader effects of semaglutide in the management of obesity.
This Cochrane review was funded by the World Health Organization (WHO).
Original protocol (10.1002/14651858.CD015092) published in September 2022. The modifications to the original protocol were prospectively registered in PROSPERO (CRD420250654193) in February 2025.","Obesity is a long-term condition in which a person has too much body fat. It can increase the risk of health problems like type 2 diabetes, diseases of the heart and blood vessels (cardiovascular disease), and some types of cancer. Obesity levels are increasing worldwide, placing a large burden on healthcare systems. Managing obesity often involves lifestyle changes such as eating a healthier diet and being more physically active. However, many people find these changes difficult to maintain, and doctors may prescribe medication to support weight loss. Semaglutide is a medication that mimics a natural gut hormone. It reduces appetite, helping people to lose weight. It can be given as an injection or swallowed. Some people taking semaglutide experience unwanted effects, such as feeling or being sick, diarrhoea and indigestion. Similar medications include liraglutide and tirzepatide. We wanted to know how well semaglutide works in adults with obesity in the medium term (6 to 24 months) and long term (24 months or more). We examined its effects on weight loss, unwanted effects, health problems associated with obesity, quality of life, and risk of death. We did not look at what happens after people stop taking semaglutide. We searched for studies that compared semaglutide with a placebo (a sham medication), lifestyle changes or another weight-loss medication for people living with obesity. We compared and analysed the results, and assessed our confidence in the evidence. We included 18 studies with 27,949 men and women, aged 41 to 69 years, who took semaglutide for between 6 months and 4 years or longer. The studies mainly took place in upper-middle- or high-income countries, and mostly included White and Asian people. They compared semaglutide with placebo, liraglutide and tirzepatide. The main comparison with placebo has the following findings. In the medium term (16 studies, 10,041 people): semaglutide leads to more weight loss as a percentage of body weight, and to more people losing 5% of their body weight than placebo. People may experience mild-to-moderate unwanted effects with semaglutide, but these unwanted effects probably make little or no difference to people deciding to stop treatment. The effects of semaglutide on serious unwanted effects are unclear. Semaglutide likely makes little or no difference to quality of life and may not significantly reduce major cardiovascular events or deaths. In the long term (2 studies, 17,908 people): weight loss probably continues with semaglutide as a percentage of body weight and in the number of people who lose 5% of their body weight. Semaglutide probably makes little to no difference to serious unwanted effects, and we are unsure about its effects on mild-to-moderate unwanted effects. However, these unwanted effects probably make more people decide to stop treatment. Semaglutide likely makes little or no difference to quality of life, major cardiovascular events or death. We are very confident that people taking semaglutide lose more weight than those taking placebo. However, semaglutide's manufacturer was involved in most of the studies, so our confidence in the results is limited. Study locations and participants were quite similar, so we don't know how semaglutide works for people from different backgrounds and places.",1099,semaglutide; withdrawal; medium-term follow-up; long-term follow-up; quality of life; mortality; evidence syntheses; underrepresented populations; management of obesity,What are the implications of the study's limited participant diversity on its findings?,In what ways might further independent studies contribute to the understanding of semaglutide's role in obesity management?,Select all of the following that are fruits,Describe the main comparison made in the semaglutide studies.,Explain the effects of semaglutide on weight loss according to the studies.,It restricts the applicability of results to diverse populations.; It validates the findings for all ethnic groups.; It highlights the need for additional research in diverse settings.,It restricts the applicability of results to diverse populations.; It highlights the need for additional research in diverse settings.,They can provide insights into long-term side effects.; They could eliminate all medication risks.; They might enhance understanding for underrepresented populations.,They can provide insights into long-term side effects.; They might enhance understanding for underrepresented populations.,dog; blue; grape,grape,Semaglutide was compared with a placebo; Semaglutide was compared with vitamin supplements; Semaglutide was compared with physical therapy,Semaglutide was compared with a placebo,Semaglutide leads to more weight loss than placebo; Semaglutide has no effect on weight loss; Semaglutide causes weight gain,Semaglutide leads to more weight loss than placebo

One approach to symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease is to enhance cholinergic neurotransmission in the brain by blocking the action of the enzyme responsible for the breakdown of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. This can be done by a group of drugs known as cholinesterase inhibitors. Donepezil is a cholinesterase inhibitor. This review is an updated version of a review first published in 1998. To assess the clinical efficacy and safety of donepezil in people with mild, moderate or severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease; to compare the efficacy and safety of different doses of donepezil; and to assess the effect of donepezil on healthcare resource use and costs. We searched Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvements Specialized Register, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and a number of other sources on 20 May 2017 to ensure that the search was as comprehensive and up-to-date as possible. In addition, we contacted members of the Donepezil Study Group and Eisai Inc. We included all double-blind, randomised controlled trials in which treatment with donepezil was administered to people with mild, moderate or severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease for 12 weeks or more and its effects compared with those of placebo in a parallel group of patients, or where two different doses of donepezil were compared. One reviewer (JSB) extracted data on cognitive function, activities of daily living, behavioural symptoms, global clinical state, quality of life, adverse events, deaths and healthcare resource costs. Where appropriate and possible, we estimated pooled treatment effects. We used GRADE methods to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome. Thirty studies involving 8257 participants met the inclusion criteria of the review, of which 28 studies reported results in sufficient detail for the meta-analyses. Most studies were of six months' duration or less. Only one small trial lasted 52 weeks. The studies tested mainly donepezil capsules at a dose of 5 mg/day or 10 mg/day. Two studies tested a slow-release oral formulation that delivered 23 mg/day. Participants in 21 studies had mild to moderate disease, in five studies moderate to severe, and in four severe disease. Seventeen studies were industry funded or sponsored, four studies were funded independently of industry and for nine studies there was no information on source of funding. Our main analysis compared the safety and efficacy of donepezil 10 mg/day with placebo at 24 to 26 weeks of treatment. Thirteen studies contributed data from 3396 participants to this analysis. Eleven of these studies were multicentre studies. Seven studies recruited patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease, two with moderate to severe, and four with severe Alzheimer's disease, with a mean age of about 75 years. Almost all evidence was of moderate quality, downgraded due to study limitations. After 26 weeks of treatment, donepezil compared with placebo was associated with better outcomes for cognitive function measured with the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-Cog, range 0 to 70) (mean difference (MD) -2.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.31 to -2.02, 1130 participants, 5 studies), the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score (MD 1.05, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.37, 1757 participants, 7 studies) and the Severe Impairment Battery (SIB, range 0 to 100) (MD 5.92, 95% CI 4.53 to 7.31, 1348 participants, 5 studies). Donepezil was also associated with better function measured with the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study activities of daily living score for severe Alzheimer's disease (ADCS-ADL-sev) (MD 1.03, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.85, 733 participants, 3 studies). A higher proportion of participants treated with donepezil experienced improvement on the clinician-rated global impression of change scale (odds ratio (OR) 1.92, 95% CI 1.54 to 2.39, 1674 participants, 6 studies). There was no difference between donepezil and placebo for behavioural symptoms measured by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) (MD -1.62, 95% CI -3.43 to 0.19, 1035 participants, 4 studies) or by the Behavioural Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease (BEHAVE-AD) scale (MD 0.4, 95% CI -1.28 to 2.08, 194 participants, 1 study). There was also no difference between donepezil and placebo for Quality of Life (QoL) (MD -2.79, 95% CI -8.15 to 2.56, 815 participants, 2 studies). Participants receiving donepezil were more likely to withdraw from the studies before the end of treatment (24% versus 20%, OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.50, 2846 participants, 12 studies) or to experience an adverse event during the studies (72% vs 65%, OR 1.59, 95% 1.31 to 1.95, 2500 participants, 10 studies). There was no evidence of a difference between donepezil and placebo for patient total healthcare resource utilisation. Three studies compared donepezil 10 mg/day to donepezil 5 mg/day over 26 weeks. The 5 mg dose was associated with slightly worse cognitive function on the ADAS-Cog, but not on the MMSE or SIB, with slightly better QoL and with fewer adverse events and withdrawals from treatment. Two studies compared donepezil 10 mg/day to donepezil 23 mg/day. There were no differences on efficacy outcomes, but fewer participants on 10 mg/day experienced adverse events or withdrew from treatment. There is moderate-quality evidence that people with mild, moderate or severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease treated for periods of 12 or 24 weeks with donepezil experience small benefits in cognitive function, activities of daily living and clinician-rated global clinical state. There is some evidence that use of donepezil is neither more nor less expensive compared with placebo when assessing total healthcare resource costs. Benefits on 23 mg/day were no greater than on 10 mg/day, and benefits on the 10 mg/day dose were marginally larger than on the 5 mg/day dose, but the rates of withdrawal and of adverse events before end of treatment were higher the higher the dose.","Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia. As the disease progresses, people lose the ability to remember, communicate, think clearly and perform the activities of daily living. Their behaviour may also change. In severe Alzheimer's disease people lose the ability to care for themselves. The most commonly used treatment for Alzheimer's disease are medicines known as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Donepezil is one of these medicines. It is taken as a pill once a day. In Alzheimer's disease, one of the changes in the brain is a reduced number of nerve cells called cholinergic neurones. These are nerve cells that signal to other cells using a chemical called acetylcholine. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as donepezil, work by preventing acetylcholine from being broken down. This may improve the symptoms of dementia. However, acetylcholine is also found elsewhere in the body and so drugs of this type may have unwanted effects. In this review we examined evidence about benefits and harms from studies that compared donepezil, taken for at least 12 weeks, to placebo (a dummy pill), or that compared different doses of donepezil. The studies had to be double-blind and randomised, that is, the decision whether people taking part got donepezil or placebo had to be made randomly and neither they nor the researchers should have known which treatment they were getting while the trial was going on. This was to make the comparison as unbiased, or fair, as possible. We searched for studies up to May 2017. We assessed the quality of all the studies we included. When it was sensible to do so, we analysed the results of studies together to get an overall result. In general, we thought that the quality of the evidence was moderate. The main factor reducing our confidence was concern that the results of some studies might have been biased by the way they were done. We cannot be sure that the results apply to treatment longer than six months. After six months of treatment, there are benefits of donepezil that are large enough to measure in studies. It is associated with side effects that are mainly mild, but that may cause people to stop treatment. Being able to stabilise cognitive performance or ability to maintain activities of daily living may be important clinically. In terms of total healthcare costs the use of donepezil appears cost neutral. However, there does not appear to be an effect on quality of life. More data are still required from longer-term clinical studies examining measures of disease progression or time to needing full time care.",1127,Alzheimer's disease; dementia; cholinergic neurotransmission; cholinesterase inhibitors; donepezil; acetylcholine,What motivations likely influenced the research focus on the efficacy and safety of donepezil in Alzheimer's treatment?,"In evaluating the effects of different doses of donepezil, what criteria were used to assess its impact?",Select all of the following that are colors,What are the potential limitations in interpreting the study's findings about donepezil's efficacy?,Judge the appropriateness of using donepezil as a treatment in patients with severe Alzheimer's disease based on study outcomes.,The prevalence of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors as a treatment for Alzheimer's.; Need to determine the cost-effectiveness of donepezil compared to other medications.; The potential for donepezil to replace all other Alzheimer's treatments.,The prevalence of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors as a treatment for Alzheimer's.; Need to determine the cost-effectiveness of donepezil compared to other medications.,Cognitive function improvements.; Comparison of behavioral changes between groups.; Differences in patient weight gain.,Cognitive function improvements.; Comparison of behavioral changes between groups.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Evidence based mainly on short-term studies.; Conflict of interest due to industry funding.; Absence of control groups in trials.,Evidence based mainly on short-term studies.; Conflict of interest due to industry funding.,Appropriate due to measurable benefits in cognitive stability.; Inappropriate due to significant adverse effects.; Inappropriate because it leads to rapid disease progression.,Appropriate due to measurable benefits in cognitive stability.
5f111456d672e8471ca03f46,interactive_4,Can strategies intended to improve how care is organised or delivered to people with overweight or obesity lead to greater weight reduction?,"The prevalence of overweight and obesity is increasing globally, an increase which has major implications for both population health and costs to health services. This is an update of a Cochrane Review.
To assess the effects of strategies to change the behaviour of health professionals or the organisation of care compared to standard care, to promote weight reduction in children and adults with overweight or obesity.
We searched the following databases for primary studies up to September 2016: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, DARE and PsycINFO. We searched the reference lists of included studies and two trial registries.
We considered randomised trials that compared routine provision of care with interventions aimed either at changing the behaviour of healthcare professionals or the organisation of care to promote weight reduction in children and adults with overweight or obesity. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane when conducting this review. We report the results for the professional interventions and the organisational interventions in seven 'Summary of findings' tables. We identified 12 studies for inclusion in this review, seven of which evaluated interventions targeting healthcare professional and five targeting the organisation of care. Eight studies recruited adults with overweight or obesity and four recruited children with obesity. Eight studies had an overall high risk of bias, and four had a low risk of bias. In total, 139 practices provided care to 89,754 people, with a median follow-up of 12 months. Professional interventions Educational interventions aimed at general practitioners (GPs), may slightly reduce the weight of participants (mean difference (MD) -1.24 kg, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.84 to 0.37; 3 studies, N = 1017 adults; low-certainty evidence). Tailoring interventions to improve GPs' compliance with obesity guidelines probably leads to little or no difference in weight loss (MD 0.05 (kg), 95% CI -0.32 to 0.41; 1 study, N = 49,807 adults; moderate-certainty evidence). It is uncertain if providing doctors with reminders results in a greater weight reduction than standard care (men: MD -11.20 kg, 95% CI -20.66 kg to -1.74 kg, and women: MD -1.30 kg, 95% CI [-7.34, 4.74] kg; 1 study, N = 90 adults; very low-certainty evidence). Providing clinicians with a clinical decision support (CDS) tool to assist with obesity management at the point of care leads to little or no difference in the body mass index (BMI) z-score of children (MD -0.08, 95% CI -0.15 to -0.01 in 378 children; moderate-certainty evidence), CDS tools may lead to little or no difference in weight loss in adults: MD -0.095 kg (-0.21 lbs), P = 0.47; 1 study, N = 35,665; low-certainty evidence. Organisational interventions Adults with overweight or obesity may lose more weight if the care was provided by a dietitian (by -5.60 kg, 95% CI -4.83 kg to -6.37 kg) or by a doctor-dietitian team (by -6.70 kg, 95% CI -7.52 kg to -5.88 kg; 1 study, N = 270 adults; low-certainty evidence). Shared care leads to little or no difference in the BMI z-score of children with obesity (adjusted MD -0.05, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.03; 1 study, N = 105 children; low-certainty evidence). Organisational restructuring of the delivery of primary care (i.e. introducing the chronic care model) may result in a slightly lower increase in the BMI of children who received care at intervention clinics (BMI change: adjusted MD -0.21, 95% CI -0.50 to 0.07; 1 study, unadjusted MD -0.18, 95% CI -0.20 to -0.16; N=473 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Mail and phone interventions probably lead to little or no difference in weight loss in adults (mean weight change (kg) using mail: -0.36, 95% CI -1.18 to 0.46; phone: -0.44, 95% CI -1.26 to 0.38; 1 study, N = 1801 adults; moderate-certainty evidence). Care delivered by a nurse at a primary care clinic may lead to little or no difference in the BMI z-score in children (MD -0.02, 95% CI -0.16 to 0.12; 1 study, N = 52 children; very low-certainty evidence). Two studies reported data on cost effectiveness: one study favoured mail and standard care over telephone consultations, and the other study achieved weight loss at a modest cost in both intervention groups (doctor and doctor-dietitian). One study of shared care reported similar adverse effects in both groups. We found little convincing evidence for a clinically-important effect on participants' weight or BMI of any of the evaluated interventions. While pooled results from three studies indicate that educational interventions targeting healthcare professionals may lead to a slight weight reduction in adults, the certainty of these results is low. Two trials evaluating CDS tools (unpooled results) for improved weight management suggest little or no effect on weight or BMI change in adults or children with overweight or obesity. Evidence for all the other interventions evaluated came mostly from single studies. The certainty of the included evidence varied from moderate to very low for the main outcomes (weight and BMI). All of the evaluated interventions would need further investigation to ascertain their strengths and limitations as effective strategies to change the behaviour of healthcare professionals or the organisation of care. As only two studies reported on cost, we know little about cost effectiveness across the evaluated interventions.","To assess the effectiveness of strategies to change the behaviour of health professionals and the organisation of care to promote weight reduction in people with overweight and obesity. This is an update of a Cochrane Review.
The number of people with overweight or obesity is increasing around the world. Excessive weight is associated with many chronic diseases. We searched the literature for studies that evaluated the effects of interventions aimed at changing the behaviour of health professionals or the way care is organised for improved weight management and weight loss. We included 12 studies, eight in adults and four in children. One hundred and thirty-nine family practices were included, providing care to 89,754 people who were followed for 12 months. Seven studies evaluated the effects of various interventions directed at healthcare professionals (i.e. education, reminders, and decision support tools), and the other five evaluated different organisational interventions (i.e. changes in who delivers the health care, how and where it is delivered, etc.). The comparison intervention was standard care, or the opportunity to seek it. The main outcomes assessed were weight or weight change for adults, and how their weight compared with their peers for children. Professional interventions: Brief education of primary care physicians in weight management may slightly decrease the weight of their patients. Tailoring the education to the healthcare professional to improve how closely they follow guidelines probably led to little or no difference in obesity management or weight loss at study end. We are uncertain whether issuing doctors with printed reminders about weight management strategies helped to reduce their patients' weight, compared to standard care.
Two studies reported that providing doctors with a clinical decision support tool within the practice may lead to little or no difference in the BMI of children with obesity or in the weight of adults with overweight or obesity, compared to patients receiving standard care. Organisational interventions: Two studies assessed the effect of multidisciplinary teams. Weight-loss programmes led by a dietitian or by a doctor plus a dietitian may lead to greater weight loss in adult patients than standard care. Shared care (between family practice and hospital doctors and dietitians) probably leads to little or no difference in the BMI of children with obesity, compared to standard care. Organisational restructuring of the delivery of family practice care (i.e. introducing the chronic care model: training of the whole practice team, enhanced electronic medical record system, the paediatric nurse practitioners playing a key role in delivering the intervention) led to a slightly lower increase in the BMI of children with obesity at intervention clinics, compared to standard care.
Two studies assessed changes in the setting of service delivery. The use of both mail and phone interventions to promote weight loss probably led to little or no difference in weight loss of adults with overweight or obesity, compared to standard care. Family practice weight management programmes conducted by nurses may lead to little or no difference in BMI in children with obesity, as compared to specialist obesity hospital clinics run by consultants.",1098,overweight; obesity; dietitian; general practitioners (GPs); chronic care model; primary care; adverse effects; intervention clinics,What factors may influence the effectiveness of health professional-targeted interventions on weight management?,How do organisational interventions compare to professional interventions in terms of weight loss outcomes for adults?,Select the items that are animals,"In assessing the interventions, what might be a limitation impacting the study results?",Which group showed a weight reduction from education interventions according to the findings?,The use of clinical decision support tools; The patient's socioeconomic status; Tailoring the education of healthcare providers,The use of clinical decision support tools; Tailoring the education of healthcare providers,Organisational interventions may lead to greater weight loss; Both interventions have equivalent outcomes; Professional interventions consistently lead to better outcomes,Organisational interventions may lead to greater weight loss,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,Variability in participant demographics; The low certainty of evidence; Inconsistent intervention duration,The low certainty of evidence,Adult patients; Children with obesity; Healthcare professionals,Adult patients
5f111456d672e8471ca03f46,finetuned_5,Does random drug and alcohol testing prevent injuries in workers?,"Drug- and alcohol-related impairment in the workplace has been linked to an increased risk of injury for workers. Randomly testing populations of workers for these substances has become a practice in many jurisdictions, with the intention of reducing the risk of workplace incidents and accidents. Despite the proliferation of random drug and alcohol testing (RDAT), there is currently a lack of consensus about whether it is effective at preventing workplace injury, or improving other non-injury accident outcomes in the work place.
To assess the effectiveness of workplace RDAT to prevent injuries and improve non-injury accident outcomes (unplanned events that result in damage or loss of property) in workers compared with no workplace RDAT.
We conducted a systematic literature search to identify eligible published and unpublished studies. The date of the last search was 1 November 2020. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, two other databases, Google Scholar, and three trials registers. We also screened the reference lists of relevant publications known to us.
Study designs that were eligible for inclusion in our review included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-randomised trials (CRTs), interrupted time-series (ITS) studies, and controlled before-after (CBA) studies. Studies needed to evaluate the effectiveness of RDAT in preventing workplace injury or improving other non-injury workplace outcomes. We also considered unpublished data from clinical trial registries. We included employees working in all safety-sensitive occupations, except for commercial drivers, who are the subject of another Cochrane Review.
Independently, two review authors used a data collection form to extract relevant characteristics from the included study. They then analysed a line graph included in the study of the prevalence rate of alcohol violations per year. Independently, the review authors completed a GRADE assessment, as a means of rating the quality of the evidence.
Although our searching originally identified 4198 unique hits, only one study was eligible for inclusion in this review. This was an ITS study that measured the effect of random alcohol testing (RAT) on the test positivity rate of employees of major airlines in the USA from 1995 to 2002. The study included data from 511,745 random alcohol tests, and reported no information about testing for other substances. The rate of positive results was the only outcome of interest reported by the study. The average rate of positive results found by RAT increased from 0.07% to 0.11% when the minimum percentage of workers who underwent RAT annually was reduced from 25% to 10%. Our analyses found this change to be a statistically significant increase (estimated change in level, where the level reflects the average percentage points of positive tests = 0.040, 95% confidence interval 0.005 to 0.075; P = 0.031). Our GRADE assessment, for the observed effect of lower minimum testing percentages associating with a higher rate of positive test results, found the quality of the evidence to be 'very low' across the five GRADE domains. The one included study did not address the following outcomes of interest: fatal injuries; non-fatal injuries; non-injury accidents; absenteeism; and adverse effects associated with RDAT.
In the aviation industry in the USA, the only setting for which the eligible study reported data, there was a statistically significant increase in the rate of positive RAT results following a reduction in the percentage of workers tested, which we deem to be clinically relevant. This result suggests an inverse relationship between the proportion of positive test results and the rate of testing, which is consistent with a deterrent effect for testing. No data were reported on adverse effects related to RDAT. We could not draw definitive conclusions regarding the effectiveness of RDAT for employees in safety-sensitive occupations (not including commercial driving), or with safety-sensitive job functions. We identified only one eligible study that reflected one industry in one country, was of non-randomised design, and tested only for alcohol, not for drugs or other substances. Our GRADE assessment resulted in a 'very low' rating for the quality of the evidence on the only outcome reported. The paucity of eligible research was a major limitation in our review, and additional studies evaluating the effect of RDAT on safety outcomes are needed.","Workplace accidents and injuries happen more often when people's physical abilities and judgement are impaired by drugs or alcohol. The workplace is not usually a place where research is conducted. There are many factors that make it difficult for an employer to measure the impact of a workplace drug testing program on the overarching goal of ensuring a safe workplace. Some employers particularly in sectors where safety is very important, such as the commercial driving and airline industries choose to test workers randomly for drugs and alcohol (random drug and alcohol testing (RDAT)). Through such testing, employers hope to deter employees from inappropriate use of these substances. However, we do not know if RDAT produces the desired effect. We wanted to know whether RDAT in the workplace prevents injuries and unplanned events that result in damage or loss of property (non-injury accidents) compared with no RDAT. We wanted to include all of the relevant research about RDAT in the workplace in our review. We looked for different kinds of published studies that measured how RDAT affected workplace safety. We excluded research on RDAT in commercial drivers, because another Cochrane Review covering these studies has already been published. Two authors from our team examined all of the references identified by our search, but they found only one study that met our selection criteria and could be included in the review. This study investigated random alcohol testing in airline employees in the USA whose jobs included safety-related tasks. The study did not test employees for drugs. Airlines are required by law to test and report on a randomly selected sample of their employees. The study used testing data from between 1995 and 2002. A total of 511,745 random alcohol tests were performed on airline employees. From 1995 to 1997, random tests for alcohol included 25% of the relevant airlines' workforce each year. During this period, the average percentage of employees who tested positive for alcohol was 0.07%. From 1998 to 2002, the proportion of the workforce tested each year dropped to 10%. During this period, the average percentage of employees who tested positive for alcohol increased to 0.11%. This means that when the airlines randomly tested a larger percentage of employees per year, a smaller proportion of them tested positive for alcohol. This relationship between the frequency of alcohol testing and the proportion of positive tests is what we would expect to see if testing has a deterrent effect, though one study alone cannot prove that there is a deterrent effect. This study did not provide any information for other areas of interest to us, specifically: fatal injuries; non-fatal injuries (in which people are physically injured, but do not die); 'non-injury accidents'; that is, accidents in which people are not injured, but property, processes, materials, and/or the environment are damaged; absenteeism; and unwanted, or adverse, events associated with RDAT, including impacts on privacy, confidentiality and employee perceptions. Two of our team rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as number of studies, study size and methods. Overall, our confidence in the evidence was very low. This means we cannot rely on what this study reported to make generalisations about the effectiveness of random alcohol testing alone, or random alcohol testing combined with drug testing (RDAT), in the workplace. We need researchers to do more studies to find the answers.",1058,Random drug and alcohol testing (RDAT); test positivity rate; adverse effects; deterrent effect,What criteria could be used to judge the efficacy of RDAT in preventing non-injury accidents?,What does RDAT stand for in the context of workplace safety?,Select all of the following that are fruits,What was the observed relationship between the percentage of workers tested and the positive test rate?,"According to the summary, what is one potential goal of implementing RDAT in the workplace?",The reduction in reported property damage incidents.; The emotional responses of employees tested.; The change in absenteeism rates post-RDAT implementation.,The reduction in reported property damage incidents.; The change in absenteeism rates post-RDAT implementation.,Random Drug and Alcohol Testing; Routine Daily Activity Tracking; Regulated Dangerous Activity Testing,Random Drug and Alcohol Testing,dog; blue; grape,grape,A higher percentage of workers tested was associated with a lower positive test rate.; A higher percentage of workers tested was associated with a higher positive test rate.; The percentage of workers tested had no impact on the positive test rate.,A higher percentage of workers tested was associated with a lower positive test rate.,To deter inappropriate use of substances among employees.; To increase employee productivity.; To decrease employee turnover.,To deter inappropriate use of substances among employees.
5f111456d672e8471ca03f46,finetuned_6,Ivermectin for preventing and treating COVID-19,"Ivermectin, an antiparasitic agent, inhibits the replication of viruses in vitro, and the molecular hypothesis of its antiviral mode of action suggests an inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2 replication in early stages of infection, although current evidence on ivermectin for prevention of infection and treatment of COVID-19 is conflicting. The objective was to assess the efficacy and safety of ivermectin plus standard of care compared to standard of care plus or minus placebo, or any other proven intervention, for people with COVID-19 receiving inpatient or outpatient treatment, and for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection as postexposure prophylaxis. We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, Web of Science, WHO COVID-19 Global literature, and the HTA database weekly without language restrictions to 16 December 2021, and additionally included trials with more than 1000 participants up to April 2022. We included randomized controlled trials comparing ivermectin to standard of care, placebo, or another proven intervention for treatment of confirmed COVID-19, irrespective of disease severity or setting, and for prevention of infection, with co-interventions required to be the same in both groups; in this update we reappraised eligible trials for research integrity, including only prospectively registered RCTs according to WHO guidelines. We assessed RCTs for bias using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool and used GRADE to rate certainty of evidence for outcomes in inpatients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19, outpatients with mild COVID-19, and for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We excluded seven of the 14 trials from the previous review because six were not prospectively registered and one was non-randomized; the updated review includes 11 trials with 3409 participants investigating ivermectin plus standard of care compared to standard of care plus or minus placebo. No trial investigated ivermectin for prevention or compared it to an intervention with proven efficacy. Five trials treated moderate COVID-19 in inpatient settings and six treated mild COVID-19 in outpatient settings; eight trials were double-blind and placebo-controlled, and three were open-label, with around 50% of results assessed as low risk of bias. We identified 31 ongoing trials and 28 potentially eligible trials without published results or with reporting disparities, held in awaiting classification until authors clarify details. For treating moderate-to-severe inpatient COVID-19, we are uncertain whether ivermectin plus standard of care reduces or increases all-cause mortality at 28 days (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.14 to 2.51; 3 trials, 230 participants; very low-certainty evidence), clinical worsening measured by new need for ventilation or death (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.33 to 2.04; 2 trials, 118 participants; very low-certainty evidence), or serious adverse events (RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.07 to 35.89; 2 trials, 197 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Ivermectin plus standard of care may have little or no effect on clinical improvement measured by discharge alive at day 28 (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.35; 1 trial, 73 participants; low-certainty evidence), on any adverse events during the trial (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.79; 3 trials, 228 participants; low-certainty evidence), and on viral clearance at seven days (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.58; 3 trials, 231 participants; low-certainty evidence); no trial investigated quality of life. For treating outpatients with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19, ivermectin plus standard of care probably has little or no effect on all-cause mortality at day 28 (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.25; 6 trials, 2860 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and little or no effect on quality of life measured with the PROMIS Global-10 scale (physical and mental component MD 0.00, 95% CI ranges crossing 0; 1358 participants; high-certainty evidence). Ivermectin may have little or no effect on clinical worsening measured by hospital admission or death (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.20 to 6.02; 2 trials, 590 participants; low-certainty evidence), clinical improvement measured by resolution of symptoms by day 14 (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.36; 2 trials, 478 participants; low-certainty evidence), serious adverse events (RR 2.27, 95% CI 0.62 to 8.31; 5 trials, 1502 participants; low-certainty evidence), any adverse events (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.76; 5 trials, 1502 participants; low-certainty evidence), and viral clearance at day 7 (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.48; 2 trials, 331 participants; low-certainty evidence); no trials reporting duration of symptoms were eligible for meta-analysis. For outpatients, there is currently low- to high-certainty evidence that ivermectin has no beneficial effect for people with COVID-19, and based on very low-certainty evidence for inpatients, we remain uncertain whether ivermectin prevents death or clinical worsening or increases serious adverse events, while low-certainty evidence suggests no beneficial effect on clinical improvement, viral clearance, or adverse events; no evidence is available for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this update, certainty increased due to higher-quality trials with more participants, and according to the living review approach, searches will continue to be updated.","Ivermectin is a medicine used to treat parasites, such as intestinal parasites in animals and scabies in humans, and is inexpensive and widely used where parasitic infestations are common, with few unwanted effects; medical regulators have not approved ivermectin for COVID-19. We wanted to update our knowledge of whether ivermectin reduces death, illness, and length of infection in people with COVID-19, or is useful in prevention, and included trials comparing the medicine to placebo, usual care, or treatments known to work to some extent such as dexamethasone, while excluding trials comparing ivermectin to medicines that do not work, like hydroxychloroquine, or whose effectiveness is uncertain. We evaluated effects of ivermectin in infected people on people dying, whether COVID-19 got better or worse, quality of life, serious and non-serious unwanted effects, and viral clearance; for prevention, we sought effects on preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease. We searched for randomized controlled trials investigating ivermectin to prevent or treat COVID-19, requiring laboratory-confirmed infections for hospital or outpatient participants, and in this update also investigated trustworthiness of trials, including them only if they fulfilled clear ethical and scientific criteria; we compared and summarized results and rated confidence in the evidence based on common criteria such as trial methods and sizes. We excluded seven of the 14 trials from the previous review as they did not fulfil expected criteria, and with four new trials included 11 trials with 3409 participants investigating ivermectin with usual care compared with the same usual care or placebo; for treatment, five trials were in hospital with moderate COVID-19 and six trials in outpatients with mild COVID-19, using different doses and treatment durations, and no trial investigated ivermectin for prevention; we also found 31 ongoing trials and 28 additional trials requiring clarification or not yet published. Treating people in hospital with COVID-19, we do not know whether ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment leads to more or fewer deaths, worsens or improves condition measured by need for ventilation or death, or increases or reduces serious unwanted events; ivermectin may make little or no difference to improving condition measured by discharge or to non-serious unwanted events, and seven days after treatment may make little or no difference to reduction of negative tests. Treating outpatients with COVID-19, ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment probably makes little or no difference to people dying and makes little or no difference to quality of life; it may make little or no difference to worsening condition measured by admission or death, serious unwanted events, non-serious unwanted events, improvement of symptoms in 14 days, or negative tests at seven days. Our confidence in the evidence, especially for outpatients, improved since the last review because more participants were included in high-quality trials, and although we are quite certain about risk of dying and quality of life, confidence is still low for many other outcomes because few events were measured, methods differed, and not all relevant outcomes were reported.",1109,Ivermectin; SARS-CoV-2; antiparasitic agent; postexposure prophylaxis; co-interventions; WHO guidelines; all-cause mortality; serious adverse events; clinical improvement; viral clearance,How could the exclusion of certain trials from the analysis impact the confidence in the study's conclusions?,What are the implications of finding little or no effect of ivermectin on the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients?,Select all of the following that are colors,"Considering the studyÃ¢ÂÂs findings, how might future research on ivermectin's use in COVID-19 treatment be designed?",What was the main objective of the study discussed in the summary?,It increases confidence by ensuring higher-quality evidence; It decreases confidence as fewer trials are considered; It has no impact since only reliable data is excluded,It increases confidence by ensuring higher-quality evidence,Ivermectin should not be used as a standard treatment for COVID-19; Ivermectin should be used in combination with other treatments; The use of ivermectin is justified in certain emergency situations,Ivermectin should not be used as a standard treatment for COVID-19,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,"Focus on larger-scale, high-quality, double-blind trials; Incorporate non-randomized participants to increase diversity; Reduce the number of placebo controls to simplify results","Focus on larger-scale, high-quality, double-blind trials",To assess the efficacy and safety of ivermectin compared to standard care.; To measure the economic impact of ivermectin.; To develop new antiparasitic drugs.,To assess the efficacy and safety of ivermectin compared to standard care.
5f111456d672e8471ca03f46,finetuned_6,Rivastigmine for people with Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer's disease is the commonest cause of dementia affecting older people. One of the therapeutic strategies aimed at ameliorating the clinical manifestations of Alzheimer's disease is to enhance cholinergic neurotransmission in the brain by the use of cholinesterase inhibitors to delay the breakdown of acetylcholine released into synaptic clefts. Tacrine, the first of the cholinesterase inhibitors to undergo extensive trials for this purpose, was associated with significant adverse effects including hepatotoxicity. Other cholinesterase inhibitors, including rivastigmine, with superior properties in terms of specificity of action and lower risk of adverse effects have since been introduced. Rivastigmine has received approval for use in 60 countries including all member states of the European Union and the USA. To determine the clinical efficacy and safety of rivastigmine for patients with dementia of Alzheimer's type. We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialized Register, on 2 March 2015 using the terms: Rivastigmine OR exelon OR ENA OR ""SDZ ENA 713"". ALOIS contains records of clinical trials identified from monthly searches of a number of major healthcare databases (Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS), numerous trial registries and grey literature sources. We included all unconfounded, double-blind, randomised, controlled trials in which treatment with rivastigmine was administered to patients with dementia of the Alzheimer's type for 12 weeks or more and its effects compared with those of placebo in a parallel group of patients, or where two formulations of rivastigmine were compared. One review author (JSB) applied the study selection criteria, assessed the quality of studies and extracted data. A total of 13 trials met the inclusion criteria of the review. The trials had a duration of between 12 and 52 weeks. The older trials tested a capsule form with a dose of up to 12 mg/day. Trials reported since 2007 have tested continuous dose transdermal patch formulations delivering 4.6, 9.5 and 17.7 mg/day. Our main analysis compared the safety and efficacy of rivastigmine 6 to 12 mg/day orally or 9.5 mg/day transdermally with placebo. Seven trials contributed data from 3450 patients to this analysis. Data from another two studies were not included because of a lack of information and methodological concerns. All the included trials were multicentre trials and recruited patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease with a mean age of about 75 years. All had low risk of bias for randomisation and allocation but the risk of bias due to attrition was unclear in four studies, low in one study and high in two studies. After 26 weeks of treatment rivastigmine compared to placebo was associated with better outcomes for cognitive function measured with the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-Cog) score (mean difference (MD) -1.79; 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.21 to -1.37, n = 3232, 6 studies) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score (MD 0.74; 95% CI 0.52 to 0.97, n = 3205, 6 studies), activities of daily living (SMD 0.20; 95% CI 0.13 to 0.27, n = 3230, 6 studies) and clinician rated global impression of changes, with a smaller proportion of patients treated with rivastigmine experiencing no change or a deterioration (OR 0.68; 95% CI 0.58 to 0.80, n = 3338, 7 studies). Three studies reported behavioural change, and there were no differences compared to placebo (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.04; 95% CI -0.14 to 0.06, n = 1529, 3 studies). Only one study measured the impact on caregivers using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Caregiver Distress (NPI-D) scale and this found no difference between the groups (MD 0.10; 95% CI -0.91 to 1.11, n = 529, 1 study). Overall, participants who received rivastigmine were about twice as likely to withdraw from the trials (odds ratio (OR) 2.01, 95% CI 1.71 to 2.37, n = 3569, 7 studies) or to experience an adverse event during the trials (OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.82 to 2.57, n = 3587, 7 studies). Rivastigmine (6 to 12 mg daily orally or 9.5 mg daily transdermally) appears to be beneficial for people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. In comparisons with placebo, better outcomes were observed for rate of decline of cognitive function and activities of daily living, although the effects were small and of uncertain clinical importance. There was also a benefit from rivastigmine on the outcome of clinician's global assessment. There were no differences between the rivastigmine group and placebo group in behavioural change or impact on carers. At these doses the transdermal patch may have fewer side effects than the capsules but has comparable efficacy. The quality of evidence is only moderate for all of the outcomes reviewed because of a risk of bias due to dropouts. ","Alzheimer's disease is the commonest cause of dementia affecting older people. As the disease progresses, people lose the ability to remember, communicate, think clearly and perform the usual daily activities. Their behaviour or personality may also change. In severe Alzheimer's disease, the patients lose the ability to care for themselves and require full time care. Currently, there is no cure available for Alzheimer's disease, but a few pharmacological interventions are available to alleviate symptoms. The symptoms are caused by the loss of a type of nerve cell in the brain called cholinergic neurons. Rivastigmine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, works by increasing the levels of a brain chemical called acetylcholine which allows the nerve cells to communicate. This may improve the symptoms of dementia. Rivastigmine can be taken orally, either as capsules or a liquid, or by applying a patch on the skin. Its effectiveness in improving the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and safety were evaluated in this review.This review included double-blinded randomised controlled trials, and the evidence was searched for up to March 2015 using the standard Cochrane methods. The review included studies conducted for at least 12 weeks that compared the safety and effectiveness of rivastigmine compared with placebo. Thirteen studies that met these criteria were found. Most of these studies involved people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease with an average age of around 75 years. The quality of the evidence for most of the outcomes reviewed was moderate. The main factors affecting our confidence in the results included relatively high number of patients dropping out in some of the trials (the rates of dropout in the rivastigmine arms were higher). There were also concerns about the applicability of the evidence for the long term treatment of Alzheimer's disease since data from double-blinded randomised controlled trials were only available for up to 12 months. All the data included in the main analysis of this review came from studies either sponsored or funded by the drug manufacturer (Novartis Pharma).",1128,Alzheimer's disease; cholinergic neurotransmission; cholinesterase inhibitors; acetylcholine; hepatotoxicity; rivastigmine; transdermal patch; activities of daily living; attrition,"In terms of study design, how could future investigations improve upon the current evidence regarding rivastigmine?",What conclusions can be drawn about the benefits of rivastigmine in terms of patient behavior?,Select all of the following that are colors,What is the main purpose of using rivastigmine in Alzheimer's disease?,Summarize the main findings regarding the efficacy of rivastigmine.,Include more diverse patient populations for broader applicability.; Focus solely on short-term effects to enhance result precision.; Implement measures to reduce dropout rates.,Include more diverse patient populations for broader applicability.; Implement measures to reduce dropout rates.,Rivastigmine leads to significant improvements in behavior compared to placebo.; There are no observable differences between rivastigmine and placebo in behavioral changes.; Behavioral improvements are the primary benefit of rivastigmine.,There are no observable differences between rivastigmine and placebo in behavioral changes.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,To cure Alzheimer's disease; To alleviate symptoms of dementia; To increase the production of neurons,To alleviate symptoms of dementia,Rivastigmine significantly improved cognitive functions.; Rivastigmine halted the progression of Alzheimer's.; Rivastigmine showed no differences compared to placebo.,Rivastigmine significantly improved cognitive functions.
62ac706d8544dbe5a81b4212,static_1,Low-carbohydrate diets or balanced-carbohydrate diets: which works better for weight loss and heart disease risks?,"Debates on effective and safe diets for managing obesity in adults are ongoing. Low-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets (also known as 'low-carb diets') continue to be widely promoted, marketed and commercialised as being more effective for weight loss, and healthier, than 'balanced'-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets. To compare the effects of low-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets to weight-reducing diets with balanced ranges of carbohydrates, in relation to changes in weight and cardiovascular risk, in overweight and obese adults without and with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We searched MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase (Ovid), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Web of Science Core Collection (Clarivate Analytics), ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to 25 June 2021, and screened reference lists of included trials and relevant systematic reviews. Language or publication restrictions were not applied. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in adults (18 years+) who were overweight or living with obesity, without or with T2DM, and without or with cardiovascular conditions or risk factors. Trials had to compare low-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets to balanced-carbohydrate (45% to 65% of total energy (TE)) weight-reducing diets, have a weight-reducing phase of 2 weeks or longer and be explicitly implemented for the primary purpose of reducing weight, with or without advice to restrict energy intake. Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts and full?text articles to determine eligibility; and independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias using RoB 2 and assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. We stratified analyses by participants without and with T2DM, and by diets with weight-reducing phases only and those with weight-reducing phases followed by weight-maintenance phases. Primary outcomes were change in body weight (kg) and the number of participants per group with weight loss of at least 5%, assessed at short- (three months to < 12 months) and long-term (? 12 months) follow-up. We included 61 parallel-arm RCTs that randomised 6925 participants to either low-carbohydrate or balanced-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets. All trials were conducted in high-income countries except for one in China. Most participants (n = 5118 randomised) did not have T2DM. Mean baseline weight across trials was 95 kg (range 66 to 132 kg). Participants with T2DM were older (mean 57 years, range 50 to 65) than those without T2DM (mean 45 years, range 22 to 62). Most trials included men and women (42/61; 3/19 men only; 16/19 women only), and people without baseline cardiovascular conditions, risk factors or events (36/61). Mean baseline diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol across trials were within normal ranges. The longest weight-reducing phase of diets was two years in participants without and with T2DM. Evidence from studies with weight-reducing phases followed by weight-maintenance phases was limited. Most trials investigated low-carbohydrate diets (> 50 g to 150 g per day or < 45% of TE; n = 42), followed by very low (? 50 g per day or < 10% of TE; n = 14), and then incremental increases from very low to low (n = 5). The most common diets compared were low-carbohydrate, balanced-fat (20 to 35% of TE) and high-protein (> 20% of TE) treatment diets versus control diets balanced for the three macronutrients (24/61). In most trials (45/61) the energy prescription or approach used to restrict energy intake was similar in both groups. We assessed the overall risk of bias of outcomes across trials as predominantly high, mostly from bias due to missing outcome data. Using GRADE, we assessed the certainty of evidence as moderate to very low across outcomes. Participants without and with T2DM lost weight when following weight-reducing phases of both diets at the short (range: 12.2 to 0.33 kg) and long term (range: 13.1 to 1.7 kg). In overweight and obese participants without T2DM: low-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets compared to balanced-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets (weight-reducing phases only) probably result in little to no difference in change in body weight over three to 8.5 months (mean difference (MD) ?1.07 kg, (95% confidence interval (CI) ?1.55 to ?0.59, I2 = 51%, 3286 participants, 37 RCTs, moderate-certainty evidence) and over one to two years (MD ?0.93 kg, 95% CI ?1.81 to ?0.04, I2 = 40%, 1805 participants, 14 RCTs, moderate-certainty evidence); as well as change in DBP and LDL cholesterol over one to two years. The evidence is very uncertain about whether there is a difference in the number of participants per group with weight loss of at least 5% at one year (risk ratio (RR) 1.11, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.31, I2 = 17%, 137 participants, 2 RCTs, very low-certainty evidence). In overweight and obese participants with T2DM: low-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets compared to balanced-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets (weight-reducing phases only) probably result in little to no difference in change in body weight over three to six months (MD ?1.26 kg, 95% CI ?2.44 to ?0.09, I2 = 47%, 1114 participants, 14 RCTs, moderate-certainty evidence) and over one to two years (MD ?0.33 kg, 95% CI ?2.13 to 1.46, I2 = 10%, 813 participants, 7 RCTs, moderate-certainty evidence); as well in change in DBP, HbA1c and LDL cholesterol over 1 to 2 years. The evidence is very uncertain about whether there is a difference in the number of participants per group with weight loss of at least 5% at one to two years (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.20, I2 = 0%, 106 participants, 2 RCTs, very low-certainty evidence). Evidence on participant-reported adverse effects was limited, and we could not draw any conclusions about these. There is probably little to no difference in weight reduction and changes in cardiovascular risk factors up to two years' follow-up, when overweight and obese participants without and with T2DM are randomised to either low-carbohydrate or balanced-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets.","What are low-carbohydrate and balanced-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets? People spend lots of money on trying to lose weight using diets, products, foods and books, and continue to debate about which diets are effective and safe. So, examining the scientific evidence behind claims made is important. Low-carbohydrate diets are a broad category of weight-reducing diets that manipulate and restrict carbohydrates, protein and fat in diets. There are no consistent, widely-accepted definitions of these diets and different descriptions are used (such as, 'low-carbohydrate, high-protein, 'low-carbohydrate, high-fat', or very low-carbohydrate). Low-carbohydrate diets are implemented in different ways, but they restrict grains, cereals and legumes, and other carbohydrate-containing foods; such as dairy, most fruit and certain vegetables. These foods are then typically replaced with foods higher in fat and protein; such as meats, eggs, cheese, butter, cream, oils. Some low-carbohydrate diets recommend eating as desired, while others recommend restricting the amount of energy eaten. Balanced-carbohydrate diets contain more moderate amounts of carbohydrates, protein and fats, in line with current healthy eating advice from health authorities. When used for weight reduction, balanced diets recommend restricting the amount of energy eaten by guiding people to reduce their portion sizes and choose healthier foods (e.g. lean instead of fatty meat). Low-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets are widely promoted, marketed and commercialised as being more effective for weight loss, and healthier, than 'balanced'-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets. What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out if low-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets were better for weight loss and heart disease risk factors than balanced-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets in adults who were overweight or living with obesity. We wanted to find this out for people with and without type 2 diabetes. What did we do? We searched six electronic databases and trial registries for all trials* that compared low-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets with balanced-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets in adults who were overweight or living with obesity. The trials had to last for at least three months. We compared and summarised the results of the trials and rated our confidence in the combined evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. *A trial is a type of study in which participants are assigned randomly to two or more treatment groups. This is the best way to ensure similar groups of participants. What did we find? We found 61 trials involving 6925 people who were overweight or living with obesity. The biggest trial was in 419 people and the smallest was in 20 people. All except one of the trials were conducted in high-income countries worldwide, and nearly half were undertaken in the USA (26). Most trials (36) were undertaken in people who did not have heart disease or risk factors. Most people (5118 people) did not have type 2 diabetes. The average starting weight of people across the trials was 95 kg. Most studies (37) lasted for six months or less; and the longest studies (6) lasted for two years. Main results Low-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets probably result in little to no difference in weight loss over the short term (trials lasting 3 to 8.5 months) and long term (trials lasting one to two years) compared to balanced-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets, in people with and without type 2 diabetes. In the short term, the average difference in weight loss was about 1 kg and in the long term, the average difference was less than 1 kg. People lost weight on both diets in some trials. The amount of weight lost on average varied greatly with both diets across the trials from less than 1 kg in some trials and up to about 12 kg in others in the short term and long term. Similarly, low-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets probably result in little to no difference in diastolic blood pressure, glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and LDL cholesterol (unhealthy cholesterol) for up to two years. We could not draw any conclusions about unwanted effects reported by participants because very few trials reported these. What are the limitations of the evidence? We are moderately confident in the evidence. Our confidence was lowered mainly because of concerns about how some the trials were conducted, which included that many trials did not report all their results.

62ac706d8544dbe5a81b4212,static_2,Ezetimibe for the prevention of heart disease and death,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains an important cause of mortality and morbidity, and high levels of blood cholesterol are thought to be the major modifiable risk factors for CVD. The use of statins is the preferred treatment strategy for the prevention of CVD, but some people at high-risk for CVD are intolerant to statin therapy or unable to achieve their treatment goals with the maximal recommended doses of statin. Ezetimibe is a selective cholesterol absorption inhibitor, whether it has a positive effect on CVD events remains uncertain. Results from clinical studies are inconsistent and a thorough evaluation of its efficacy and safety for the prevention of CVD and mortality is necessary.
To assess the efficacy and safety of ezetimibe for the prevention of CVD and all-cause mortality.
We searched the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and Web of Science on 27 June 2018, and two clinical trial registry platforms on 11 July 2018. We checked reference lists from primary studies and review articles for additional studies. No language restrictions were applied.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared ezetimibe versus placebo or ezetimibe plus other lipid-modifying drugs versus other lipid-modifying drugs alone in adults, with or without CVD, and which had a follow-up of at least 12 months.
Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, assessed risk of bias and contacted trialists to obtain missing data. We performed statistical analyses according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and used the GRADE to assess the quality of evidence.
We included 26 RCTs randomising 23,499 participants. All included studies assessed effects of ezetimibe plus other lipid-modifying drugs compared with other lipid-modifying drugs alone or plus placebo. Our findings were driven by the largest study (IMPROVE-IT), which had weights ranging from 41.5% to 98.4% in the different meta-analyses. Ezetimibe with statins probably reduces the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events compared with statins alone (risk ratio (RR) 0.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90 to 0.98; a decrease from 284/1000 to 267/1000, 95% CI 256 to 278; 21,727 participants; 10 studies; moderate-quality evidence). Trials reporting all-cause mortality used ezetimibe with statin or fenofibrate and found they have little or no effect on this outcome (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.05; 21,222 participants; 8 studies; high-quality evidence). Adding ezetimibe to statins probably reduces the risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.95; a decrease from 105/1000 to 92/1000, 95% CI 85 to 100; 21,145 participants; 6 studies; moderate-quality evidence) and non-fatal stroke (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.97; a decrease 32/1000 to 27/1000, 95% CI 23 to 31; 21,205 participants; 6 studies; moderate-quality evidence). Trials reporting cardiovascular mortality added ezetimibe to statin or fenofibrate, probably having little or no effect on this outcome (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.12; 19457 participants; 6 studies; moderate-quality evidence). The need for coronary revascularisation might be reduced by adding ezetimibe to statin (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.89 to 0.99; a decrease from 196/1000 to 184/1000, 95% 175 to 194; 21,323 participants; 7 studies); however, no difference in coronary revascularisation rate was observed when a sensitivity analysis was limited to studies with a low risk of bias. In terms of safety, adding ezetimibe to statins may make little or no difference in the risk of hepatopathy (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.35; 20,687 participants; 4 studies; low-quality evidence). It is uncertain whether ezetimibe increase or decrease the risk of myopathy (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.72 to 2.38; 20,581 participants; 3 studies; very low-quality evidence) and rhabdomyolysis, given the wide CIs and low event rate. Little or no difference in the risk of cancer, gallbladder-related disease and discontinuation due to adverse events were observed between treatment groups. For serum lipids, adding ezetimibe to statin or fenofibrate might further reduce the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol and triglyceride levels and likely increase the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels; however, substantial heterogeneity was detected in most analyses. None of the included studies reported on health-related quality of life.
Moderate- to high-quality evidence suggests that ezetimibe has modest beneficial effects on the risk of CVD endpoints, primarily driven by a reduction in non-fatal MI and non-fatal stroke, but it has little or no effect on clinical fatal endpoints. The cardiovascular benefit of ezetimibe might involve the reduction of LDL-C, total cholesterol and triglycerides. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether ezetimibe increases the risk of adverse events due to the low and very low quality of the evidence. The evidence for beneficial effects was mainly obtained from individuals with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD, predominantly with acute coronary syndrome) administered ezetimibe plus statins. However, there is limited evidence regarding the role of ezetimibe in primary prevention and the effects of ezetimibe monotherapy in the prevention of CVD, and these topics thus requires further investigation.","Is taking ezetimibe safe and does it prevent heart disease and death? Heart disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, and controlling lipid levels is one of the most effective strategies for preventing heart disease. The use of statins is the preferred treatment strategy for the prevention of heart disease, but some people at high risk of heart disease are intolerant to statins or with a poor response to statin therapy. Ezetimibe is a non-statin drug that can reduce the blood lipids levels by inhibiting cholesterol absorption, but whether it has beneficial effects on heart disease and death remains uncertain. This evidence is current up to July 2018. We included 26 studies involving 23,499 participants. These studies assessed the effects of ezetimibe plus other lipid-lowering drugs versus lipid-lowering drugs alone for heart disease. The participants were adults, and most of them had been diagnosed with coronary heart disease. Ezetimibe with statins probably reduces the risk for combined outcome of death due to heart disease, heart attack or stroke, but the benefit is moderate. However, adding ezetimibe to statin or fenofibrate have little or no effect on death from any cause. Treatment with ezetimibe and statin probably reduces the risk for non-fatal heart attacks and non-fatal stroke. Adding ezetimibe to statin or fenofibrate probably have little or no effect on heart-related death. Ezetimibe with statins might reduce the need for coronary revascularisation (the restoration of an adequate blood supply to the heart) by means of surgery. In terms of safety, we do not have enough evidence to know whether ezetimibe increases or decreases side-effects (e.g. liver injury, muscle pain, cancer, gallbladder-related disease and discontinuation). The analysis of blood lipids revealed that the addition of ezetimibe statin or fenofibrate therapy might further reduce the levels of blood lipids, including low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ('bad' cholesterol), total cholesterol and triglycerides, and likely increased the level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ('good' cholesterol).

62ac706d8544dbe5a81b4212,static_2,Mucolytic agents for chronic bronchitis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,"Individuals with chronic bronchitis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) often experience recurrent exacerbations involving increased sputum volume or purulence. These exacerbations carry substantial personal and healthcare burdens, so therapies that reduce their occurrence may be useful. Mucolytics are oral medications intended to reduce the viscosity of sputum, making it easier to cough up, which may decrease the frequency of COPD exacerbations. This review evaluated whether mucolytics reduce exacerbations or days of disability, whether they improve lung function or quality of life, and whether they cause adverse effects. We searched major databases through 23 April 2019 and included randomized studies comparing oral mucolytics with placebo for at least two months in adults with chronic bronchitis or COPD, excluding people with asthma or cystic fibrosis. This update added four new studies, bringing the total to 38 trials with 10,377 participants, lasting from two months to three years, and covering various mucolytics such as N-acetylcysteine, carbocysteine, erdosteine, and ambroxol. Many studies had unclear allocation concealment, possible issues with blinding, and high attrition rates. Results from 28 studies with 6723 participants showed that people receiving mucolytics were more likely to remain free of exacerbations during the study period compared with placebo (Peto OR 1.73), although more recent studies showed smaller benefits than earlier ones. The number needed to treat for an average of nine months to keep one additional person free from exacerbations was eight. High heterogeneity suggests caution in interpretation, and effects did not vary meaningfully by mucolytic type, dose, COPD severity, or exacerbation history. Longer studies reported smaller treatment effects. Mucolytics reduced days of disability by 0.43 days per month compared with placebo, and they may reduce hospitalisations, although evidence was inconsistent. Some improvement in quality of life was reported, but it did not reach the threshold for clinical importance. Mucolytics were associated with a possible reduction in adverse events, though some excluded studies reported high rates of adverse events. There was no clear difference between mucolytics and placebo with respect to mortality, although estimates were imprecise. Overall, mucolytics appear to modestly reduce exacerbations, days of disability, and possibly hospitalisations without increasing adverse events, but they have little effect on lung function or health-related quality of life. High heterogeneity and larger effects in older studies reduce confidence in the findings, and true benefits may be smaller than earlier evidence suggested.","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and chronic bronchitis are long-term breathing conditions. They cause symptoms such as shortness of breath, cough, and excess sputum. People with COPD and chronic bronchitis may have flare-ups (exacerbations) when their symptoms become worse. Mucolytics are medicines taken orally that may loosen sputum, making it easier to cough it up. Mucolytics may have other beneficial effects on lung infection and inflammation and may reduce the number of flare-ups that people with COPD and chronic bronchitis have. Mucolytics can also be inhaled, but we did not look at inhaled mucolytics in this review.
We looked for studies lasting at least two months, in which it was decided at random whether a person received a mucolytic drug or a placebo. We did not include studies involving children or people with other breathing conditions such as asthma and cystic fibrosis. We found 38 studies to include in our review. These studies included a total of 10,377 adults with COPD or chronic bronchitis. The studies used a variety of mucolytic drugs, including N-acetylcysteine, carbocysteine, and erdosteine and lasted from two months to three years. Mucolytics were taken by mouth between one and three times per day. These studies measured several different outcomes to find out if the drug was useful, including flare-ups, hospital admissions, quality of life, lung function, and side effects. We are moderately confident about the results we have presented. Our confidence is reduced by the results from individual studies looking quite different from one another and the mix of older and newer studies that we found. Also, in some cases there were not enough data to be sure whether mucolytics were better or worse than, or the same as, placebo. Mucolytics appear to be useful for reducing flare-ups, days of disability, and hospital admissions in people with COPD or chronic bronchitis, and they do not appear to cause more side effects. However, they do not appear to have much impact on quality of life or lung function, and we could not be sure about their impact on death.",1077,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
62ac706d8544dbe5a81b4212,interactive_3,"Education, incentive, and engineering-based interventions to promotethe use of seat belts","Over 1.3 million people die each year as a result of traffic collisions and hundreds of thousands of others are permanently and seriouslyinjured. Most of these deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries, where mortality rates can be up to 10 times higher than those ofsome high-income countries. Seat belts are designed to accomplish two key functions: to prevent the occupant from being ejected fromthe vehicle by the force of impact, and to extend the time that the decelerating force is applied to a person. Seat belts also spread the area ofimpact both to larger and less vulnerable parts of the body. Since the 1950s, seat belts have been factory-fitted to most vehicles, and todayaround 90% of high-income countries have adopted seat belt legislation that makes it mandatory for some, if not all, vehicle occupants towear seat belts. However, the simple passing of laws is not sufficient to ensure seat belt use, and, while the enforcement of seat belt lawsdoes increase seat belt use, other interventions have been developed to encourage voluntary  and hence sustainable behaviour change. To evaluate the benefits of behavioural-change interventions (educational-based, incentive-based, engineering-based, or a combination,but not enforcement-based) that promote the use of seat belts, and to determine which types of interventions are most effective. On 9 August 2022, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), OvidSP Embase, OvidSP MEDLINE, 14other databases, and clinical trials registers. We also screened reference lists and conference proceedings, searched websites of relevantorganisations, and contacted road safety experts. The search was performed with no restrictions in terms of language and date ofpublication. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), both individually randomised and cluster-randomised, that evaluated education,engineering, incentive-based interventions (or combinations) that promoted seat belt use. Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of RCTs, evaluated the risk of bias, and extracted data. We performed a narrativesynthesis based on effect direction due to the heterogeneity observed between RCTs and reported the synthesis in accordance with reporting guidelines for systematic reviews without meta-analysis, as appropriate. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using theGRADE approach. We analysed data on the primary outcome, frequency of wearing a seat belt. None of the included RCTs reported theother primary outcome, crash-related injury rate or the secondary outcome, crash-related mortality rates of interest in this review. We included 15 completed RCTs (12 individual, parallel-group, and three cluster) that enroled 12,081 participants, published between1990 and 2022. Four trials were published between 2019 and 2022, and the remaining trials were published 10 or more years ago. Wealso identified four ongoing RCTs. Thirteen RCTs were conducted in the USA. Trials recruited participants from various sites (worksites,schools, emergency departments, a residential retirement community, and primary care settings) and different age groups (adults,late adolescents, early adolescents, and dyads). Thirteen trials investigated educational interventions, one of which used education inaddition to incentives (one of the intervention arms) measured through participant self-reports (12) and observation (one), and two trialsinvestigated engineering-based interventions measured through in-vehicle data monitor systems at various follow-up periods (six weeksto 36 months). We grouped RCTs according to types of education-based interventions: behavioural education-based, health risk appraisal (HRA), andother education-based interventions. The evidence suggests that behavioural education-based (four trials) interventions may promoteseat belt use and HRA interventions (one trial) likely promote seat belt use in the short term (six weeks to nine months). Four of the sixtrials that investigated behavioural education-based interventions found that the intervention compared to no or another interventionmay promote seat belt use. These effects were measured through participant self-report and at various time points (six-week to 12-monthfollow-up) (low-certainty evidence). One of the three trials investigating HRA only or with additional intervention versus no or anotherintervention showed observed effects likely to promote seat belt use (moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence suggests that engineering-based interventions using vehicle monitoring systems (with in-vehicle alerts and with or withoutnotifications/feedback) may promote the use of seat belts. One trial showed that engineering interventions (in-vehicle alerts and feedback)may promote seat belt use while the other showed unclear effects in two of the three intervention groups (low-certainty evidence). Bothtrials had small sample sizes and high baseline seat belt use. The evidence suggests that behavioural education-based interventions may promote seat belt use and HRA (including incentives) with orwithout additional interventions likely promote seat belt use. Likewise, for engineering-based interventions using in-vehicle data monitorsystems with in-vehicle alerts, with or without notifications/feedback the evidence suggests the interventions may promote the use ofseat belts. Well-designed RCTs are needed to further investigate the effectiveness of education and engineering-based interventions. High-qualitytrials that examine the potential benefits of incentives to promote seat belt use, either alone or in combination with other interventions, aswell as trials to investigate other types of interventions (such as technology, media/publicity, enforcement, insurance schemes, employerprogrammes, etc.) to promote the use of seat belts, are needed. Evidence from low- and middle-income economies is required to improvethe generalisability of the data. In addition, research focused on determining which interventions or types of interventions are mosteffective in different population groups is needed.","Why is wearing a seat belt important? Many people, mostly children and young adults, die each year as a result of road traffic injuries suggesting it to be a leading cause of death with around 75% of traffic-related deaths occurring among young males. Many others are permanently and seriously injured. Seat belts are designed to protect occupants from being thrown out of the vehicle by the force of impact, and spread the impact across less vulnerable parts of the body to lessen the damage. Passing laws mandating seat belt use is not sufficient to encourage seat belt use on its own. We investigated the effectiveness of education, incentive, or engineering-based interventions, but not law enforcement, to encourage seat belt use and determine which types of interventions are most effective. Educational-based interventions are structured programmes teaching drivers and passengers the importance of using seat belts. Engineering-based interventions are design changes to the vehicle structure that promote the wearing of seat belts, such as seat belt alarms, while incentives include rewards schemes. We searched for studies that randomly allocated people travelling in passenger or commercial vehicles to interventions aiming to improve seat belt use. We excluded people travelling in farming or agricultural vehicles since these are not deemed commercial vehicles. Two review authors independently evaluated studies to judge inclusion in the review. We recorded information about the study design, setting, participants, interventions, and outcomes. In terms of outcome, we looked at the frequency of wearing a seat belt as well as crash-related injuries and deaths. Because of the differences between the included studies, we provided a written account and assessed how much each result could be trusted using the ratings high, moderate, low, or very low quality, depending on our confidence in the reliability of the results. We summarised the findings and compared study results. We found 15 studies enrolling 12,081 participants and four ongoing studies. Thirteen studies were conducted in the USA and enrolled participants from various sites (worksites, schools, emergency departments, a residential retirement community, and primary care settings) and of different age groups (adults, late and early adolescents, and dyads of child/adolescent and parent/legal guardian). Twelve studies looked at educational interventions alone, one at education and incentives, and two at engineering-based interventions. All included studies reported on the frequency of wearing a seat belt; however, most studies (12) reported this outcome through participant self-reporting. The remaining studies reported the frequency of wearing a seat belt through in-vehicle data monitoring systems (two studies) and observation (one study). None of the included studies reported crash-related injuries and deaths. Some evidence suggests that education-based and engineering-based interventions may promote seat belt use; however, we cannot be confident in the current evidence. For education-based interventions, evidence suggests that behavioural-based (motivational interviews, behavioural change counselling, and behavioural messages) and HRA (alone or with educational information plus incentive) interventions may improve seat belt use in early adolescents, late adolescents, and adults. The evidence suggests that engineering-based interventions may promote seat belt use in early adolescents and adults. More research is needed to better understand the effectiveness of education- and engineering-based interventions on seat belt use. In addition, high-quality research is needed to investigate the benefit of incentives alone or in combination with other interventions as well as research to investigate other types of interventions, different combinations of interventions, settings (such as low- and middle-income countries), and populations. Only two studies looked at engineering-based interventions to improve seat belt use and both studies enrolled a small number of participants making it challenging to conclude that these interventions are beneficial. Trials investigating educational interventions to improve seat belt use vary in terms of the type of intervention, quality, number and types of people in the study, etc. Studies included children, adolescents, and adults; however, the most effective intervention for each population group remains unclear. Our confidence in the evidence was low or moderate, mainly due to the outcome (wearing seat belts) being measured through participant self-reporting. Self-reported outcomes are open to being influenced by participants answering in a manner they believe to be desirable or by participants' limited recollection of the event being studied. None of the included studies was conducted in countries where deaths and injuries related to road traffic accidents are the highest.",1059,mortality rates; decelerating force; behavioural-change interventions; crash-related injury rate; engineering-based interventions; health risk appraisal,What factors might have contributed to the low certainty of evidence in the current study?,Identify the main goal of the study discussed in the summary.,Select all of the following that are colors,Summarize why seat belt laws alone are insufficient according to the summary.,Recognize the types of interventions evaluated in the study.,Inconsistencies in definitions of seat belt use.; Differences in intervention effectiveness across studies.; Inclusion of outdated intervention methods.,Differences in intervention effectiveness across studies.,To determine the most effective seat belt laws.; To evaluate interventions that promote seat belt use.; To analyze the decrease in car accidents.,To evaluate interventions that promote seat belt use.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Laws alone do not guarantee behavior change.; People do not understand the fines involved.; Drivers forget to read laws regularly.,Laws alone do not guarantee behavior change.,"Educational, incentive, and engineering-based.; Law enforcement and punishment-based.; Technological and media-based.","Educational, incentive, and engineering-based."
62ac706d8544dbe5a81b4212,interactive_4,Degarelix for newly diagnosed advanced prostate cancer,"Degarelix is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist that leads to medical castration used to treat men with advanced or metastatic prostate cancer, or both. It is unclear how its effects compare to standard androgen suppression therapy. We assessed the effects of degarelix compared with standard androgen suppression therapy for men with advanced hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. We searched multiple databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, LILACS until September 2020), trial registries (until October 2020), and conference proceedings (until December 2020). We identified other potentially eligible trials by reference checking, citation searching, and contacting study authors. We included randomized controlled trials comparing degarelix with standard androgen suppression therapy for men with advanced prostate cancer. Three review authors independently classified studies and abstracted data from the included studies. The primary outcomes were overall survival and serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes were quality of life, cancer-specific survival, clinical progression, other adverse events, and biochemical progression. We used a random-effects model for meta-analyses and assessed the certainty of evidence for the main outcomes according to GRADE. We included 11 studies with a follow-up of between three and 14 months. We also identified five ongoing trials. Data to evaluate overall survival were not available. Degarelix may result in little to no difference in serious adverse events compared to standard androgen suppression therapy (risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 1.05; low-certainty evidence; 2750 participants). Based on 114 serious adverse events in the standard androgen suppression group, this corresponds to 23 fewer serious adverse events per 1000 participants (43 fewer to 6 more). We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations and imprecision. Degarelix likely results in little to no difference in quality of life assessed with a variety of validated questionnaires (standardized mean difference 0.06 higher, 95% CI 0.05 lower to 0.18 higher; moderate-certainty evidence; 2887 participants), with higher scores reflecting better quality of life. We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations. Data to evaluate cancer-specific survival were not available. The effects of degarelix on cardiovascular events are very uncertain (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.61; very low-certainty evidence; 80 participants). We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations, imprecision, and indirectness as this trial was conducted in a unique group of high-risk participants with pre-existing cardiovascular morbidities. Degarelix likely results in an increase in injection site pain (RR 15.68, 95% CI 7.41 to 33.17; moderate-certainty evidence; 2670 participants). Based on 30 participants per 1000 with injection site pain with standard androgen suppression therapy, this corresponds to 440 more injection site pains per 1000 participants (192 more to 965 more). We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations. We did not identify any relevant subgroup differences for different degarelix maintenance doses. We did not find trial evidence for overall survival or cancer-specific survival comparing degarelix to standard androgen suppression, but serious adverse events and quality of life may be similar between groups. The effects of degarelix on cardiovascular events are very uncertain as the only eligible study had limitations, was small with few events, and was conducted in a high-risk population. Degarelix likely results in an increase in injection site pain compared to standard androgen suppression therapy. Maximum follow-up of included studies was 14 months, which is short. There is a need for methodologically better designed and executed studies with long-term follow-up evaluating men with metastatic prostate cancer.","How does degarelix, a newer drug that treats prostate cancer by lowering male sex hormone levels, compare to existing medications for newly diagnosed advanced prostate cancer? There is no cure if prostate cancer has spread outside of the prostate gland to lymph nodes or to the bones. In such a situation, hormonal therapy that lowers levels of the male sex hormone testosterone can slow down cancer growth. Testosterone levels are regulated by complicated mechanisms that involve a hormone known as gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which is present in men at different levels at different times of the day. It is understood that giving men with prostate cancer high levels of medications that increase GnRH levels first raises testosterone levels, and then drops them to very low levels. These medications are commonly used to treat men with prostate cancer that has spread outside the prostate. Degarelix is a newer drug known as a GnRH antagonist, which blocks receptors in the brain and thereby lowers testosterone levels immediately. We included randomized controlled trials (studies in which participants are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) comparing degarelix and standard hormonal therapy in men with newly diagnosed advanced prostate cancer. The evidence is current to September 2020 for electronic databases, to October 2020 for trial registries, and to December 2020 for conference proceedings. We found 11 studies that were eligible for inclusion in the review, but none of these studies evaluated the risk of dying from any cause or dying from prostate cancer. There may be no difference between degarelix and standard hormonal therapy in serious unwanted effects and quality of life. The effects of degarelix on cardiovascular issues such as the risk of a heart attack or stroke are uncertain; while one study suggested that the risk may be reduced with degarelix, it had major issues, in particular that it was conducted in men at high risk for such problems. We found that degarelix therapy likely results in an increase in the occurrence of pain at the injection site. The certainty of evidence for the various outcomes ranged from moderate to very low.

62ac706d8544dbe5a81b4212,interactive_4,"Thymic peptides for treatment of cancer patients in addition to chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or both","Purified thymus extracts (pTE) and synthetic thymic peptides (sTP) are thought to enhance the immune system of cancer patients to help fight tumour growth and reduce infections caused by disease-related or treatment-related immunosuppression. This review evaluated the effectiveness of pTE and sTP for cancer management. Researchers searched major medical databases up to February 2010 for randomized trials in adult cancer patients where pTE or sTP were added to chemotherapy or radiotherapy and compared with the same regimen alone or with placebo. Data were independently extracted by two authors, and odds ratios were calculated for overall survival, disease-free survival, tumour response, and adverse effects. A random-effects model was used. Twenty-six trials involving 2736 patients were identified: 20 trials investigated pTE (thymostimulin or thymosin fraction 5) and six investigated sTP (thymopentin or thymosin ?1). Twenty-one trials reported overall survival, six reported disease-free survival, 14 reported tumour response, nine reported adverse effects, and 10 reported safety. Adding pTE showed no benefit for overall survival (RR 1.00), disease-free survival (RR 0.97), or tumour response (RR 1.07), with moderate to high heterogeneity. For thymosin ?1, the pooled RR for overall survival was 1.21 and for disease-free survival was 3.37, though neither result reached statistical significance. pTE reduced the risk of severe infectious complications (RR 0.54), and thymostimulin showed a non-significant trend toward reduced severe neutropenia. Both pTE and sTP were generally well tolerated. Many trials had at least moderate risk of bias. Overall, there is no clear evidence that adding pTE to cancer treatment improves survival or tumour response, although thymosin ?1 showed a possible trend toward benefit. There is preliminary evidence that pTE may reduce severe infectious complications during chemotherapy or radiotherapy.","The immune system plays a key role in the body's own defences against cancer cells. The thymus gland plays a central part in this and modifies T-cells, a subset of lymphocytes. Studies with thymic peptides have shown a variety of effects on the immune system. There are two groups of thymic peptides available for use in treatment: purified extracts from animal (mostly calf) thymus glands and synthetically produced thymus gland peptides.
This review aims to answer the question whether having thymic peptides can improve the response to and tolerability of standard chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or combined treatment. Further questions are whether the peptides inhibit or reduce the progression and recurrence of disease, whether they prolong the life of cancer patients and whether quality of life is improved. This review looked at the evidence from 26 clinical trials with a total of 2736 adult cancer patients. Many of the trials were small and of moderate quality. Only three studies were less than 10 years old. Thymosin ?1 is a synthetic peptide that shows some promise as a treatment option for patients with metastatic melanoma when used in addition to chemotherapy. Severe problems occur during chemotherapy and radiotherapy due to low white blood cell counts and infections. These were reduced by using purified thymus extracts. However, the use of purified thymus extracts should be investigated more thoroughly before the extracts are used routinely in patients. The findings were not conclusive and caution is advised.

62ac706d8544dbe5a81b4212,finetuned_5,What are the benefits and risks of inhaled bronchodilators in preterm newborns for preventing and treating lung disease?,"Chronic lung disease (CLD) occurs frequently in preterm infants and is associated with respiratory morbidity. Bronchodilators have the potential effect of dilating small airways with muscle hypertrophy. Increased compliance and tidal volume, and decreased airway resistance, have been documented with the use of bronchodilators in infants with CLD. Therefore, bronchodilators are widely considered to have a role in the prevention and treatment of CLD, but there remains uncertainty as to whether they improve clinical outcomes. This is an update of the 2016 Cochrane review. To determine the effect of inhaled bronchodilators given as prophylaxis or as treatment for chronic lung disease (CLD) on mortality and other complications of preterm birth in infants at risk for or identified as having CLD. An Information Specialist searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and three trials registers from 2016 to May 2023. In addition, the review authors undertook reference checking, citation searching and contact with trial authors to identify additional studies. We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials involving preterm infants less than 32 weeks old that compared bronchodilators to no intervention or placebo. CLD was defined as oxygen dependency at 28 days of life or at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age. Initiation of bronchodilator therapy for the prevention of CLD had to occur within two weeks of birth. Treatment of infants with CLD had to be initiated before discharge from the neonatal unit. The intervention had to include administration of a bronchodilator by nebulisation or metered dose inhaler. The comparator was no intervention or placebo. We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Critical outcomes included: mortality within the trial period; CLD (defined as oxygen dependency at 28 days of life or at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age); adverse effects of bronchodilators, including hypokalaemia (low potassium levels in the blood), tachycardia, cardiac arrhythmia, tremor, hypertension and hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar); and pneumothorax. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. We included two randomised controlled trials in this review update. Only one trial provided useable outcome data. This trial was conducted in six neonatal intensive care units in France and Portugal, and involved 173 participants with a gestational age of less than 31 weeks. The infants in the intervention group received salbutamol for the prevention of CLD. The evidence suggests that salbutamol may result in little to no difference in mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50 to 2.31; risk difference (RD) 0.01, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.11; low-certainty evidence) or CLD at 28 days (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.37; RD 0.02, 95% CI -0.13 to 0.17; low-certainty evidence), when compared to placebo. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of salbutamol on pneumothorax. The one trial with usable data reported that there were no relevant differences between groups, without providing the number of events (very low-certainty evidence). Investigators in this study did not report if side effects occurred. We found no eligible trials that evaluated the use of bronchodilator therapy for the treatment of infants with CLD. We identified no ongoing studies. Low-certainty evidence from one trial showed that inhaled bronchodilator prophylaxis may result in little or no difference in the incidence of mortality or CLD in preterm infants, when compared to placebo. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of salbutamol on pneumothorax, and neither included study reported on the incidence of serious adverse effects. We identified no trials that studied the use of bronchodilator therapy for the treatment of CLD. Additional clinical trials are necessary to assess the role of bronchodilator agents in the prophylaxis or treatment of CLD. Researchers studying the effects of inhaled bronchodilators in preterm infants should include relevant clinical outcomes in addition to pulmonary mechanical outcomes.","Newborns born too early, especially those born before 28 weeks of pregnancy, face a higher risk of death, lung disease, and brain impairment than babies born at or near term, and some develop long-term problems such as intellectual disabilities, blindness, or deafness. Chronic lung disease is common among preterm infants who cannot breathe independently and require oxygen or mechanical ventilation. Bronchodilators are medicines that widen the air passages in the lungs and may help open small airways in preterm babies; they are used to treat or potentially prevent chronic lung disease. These medicines can be inhaled, taken by mouth, injected, or delivered through a nebuliser, but they may cause side effects such as low potassium levels, fast or abnormal heart rhythms, tremor, high blood pressure, high sugar levels, or lung collapse. We wanted to find out whether bronchodilators reduce the risk of death or chronic lung disease and whether they increase the risk of unwanted effects, including abnormal heart rhythms, tremor, high blood pressure, high sugar levels, or pneumothorax (collapsed lung). We searched for studies evaluating bronchodilators in preterm infants and summarised the findings, rating our confidence in the evidence based on study design and sample size. Only two studies met the criteria, and one did not report any relevant outcomes. The remaining study involved 173 preterm newborns at risk of chronic lung disease who were treated with salbutamol or placebo.

62ac706d8544dbe5a81b4212,finetuned_6,Prophylactic antibiotic therapy for people with chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD),"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; including chronic bronchitis and emphysema) is a chronic respiratory condition characterised by shortness of breath, cough and recurrent exacerbations. Long-term antibiotic use may reduce both bacterial load and inflammation in the airways. Studies have shown a reduction of exacerbations with antibiotics in comparison to placebo in people with COPD, but there are concerns about antibiotic resistance and safety. To compare the safety and efficacy of different classes of antibiotics (continuous, intermittent or pulsed) for prophylaxis of exacerbations in patients with COPD.
We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Trials Register and bibliographies of relevant studies. The latest literature search was conducted on 6 February 2019.
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were selected that compared one prophylactic antibiotic with another in patients with COPD.
We used the standard Cochrane methods. Two independent review authors selected trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Discrepancies were resolved by involving a third review author.
We included two RCTs, both published in 2015 involving a total of 391 participants with treatment duration of 12 to 13 weeks. One RCT compared a quinolone (moxifloxacin pulsed, for 5 days every 4 weeks), with a tetracycline (doxycycline continuous) or a macrolide (azithromycin intermittent). The second RCT compared a tetracycline (doxycycline continuous) plus a macrolide (roxithromycin continuous), with roxithromycin (continuous) alone. The trials recruited participants with a mean age of 68 years, with moderate-severity COPD. Both trials included participants who had between two and five exacerbations in the previous one to two years. In one trial, 17% of patients had previously been using inhaled corticosteroids. In the other study, all patients were positive for Chlamydophila pneumoniae (C pneumoniae). Overall, we judged the evidence presented to be of very low-certainty, mainly due to imprecision, but we also had concerns about indirectness and methodological quality of the included studies. The primary outcome measures for this review included exacerbations, quality of life, drug resistance and serious adverse events. Macrolide + tetracycline versus macrolide There was no clear difference between treatments in improvement in quality of life as assessed by the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ). The CRQ scale ranges from 0 to 10 and higher scores on the scale indicate better quality of life. CRQ sub-scales for dyspnoea (mean difference (MD) 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.84 to 2.00; 187 participants; very low-certainty evidence), fatigue (MD 0.02, 95% CI -1.08 to 1.12; 187 participants; very low-certainty evidence), emotional function (MD -0.37, 95% CI -1.74 to 1.00; 187 participants; very low-certainty evidence), or mastery (MD -0.79, 95% CI -1.86 to 0.28; 187 participants; very low-certainty evidence) at 12 weeks. For serious adverse events, it was uncertain if there was a difference between combined roxithromycin and doxycycline versus roxithromycin alone at 48 weeks follow-up after active treatment of 12 weeks (odds ratio (OR) 1.00, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.93; 198 participants; very low-certainty evidence). There were five deaths reported in the combined treatment arm, versus three in the single treatment arm at 48 weeks follow-up after active treatment of 12 weeks (OR 1.63, 95% CI 0.38 to 7.02; 198 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Quinolone versus tetracycline There was no clear difference between moxifloxacin and doxycycline for the number of participants experiencing one or more exacerbations (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.38; 50 participants, very low-certainty evidence) at 13 weeks. There were no serious adverse events or deaths reported in either treatment groups. We did not identify any evidence for our other primary outcomes. Quinolone versus macrolide There was no clear difference between moxifloxacin and azithromycin for the number of participants experiencing one or more exacerbations (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.32 to 3.10; 50 participants; very low-certainty evidence) at 13 weeks. There were no serious adverse events or deaths reported in either treatment groups. We did not identify any evidence for our other primary outcomes. Marcolide versus tetracycline There was no clear difference between azithromycin and doxycycline for the number of participants experiencing one or more exacerbations (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.38; 50 participants; very low-certainty evidence) at 13 weeks. There were no serious adverse events or deaths reported in either treatment groups. We did not identify any evidence for our other primary outcomes. We did not find head-to-head evidence for impact of antibiotics on drug resistance. It is not clear from the evidence included in this review whether there is a difference in efficacy or safety between different classes or regimens of prophylactic antibiotic, given for 12 to 13 weeks to people with COPD. Whilst no head-to-head comparisons of antibiotic resistance were identified, concerns about this continue. The sample size in this review is small and both included studies are of short duration. Thus, there is considerable uncertainty in effects observed and the effects of different prophylactic antibiotics requires further research.","COPD is a common condition caused mainly by smoking and can lead to long-term breathing problems. Symptoms include shortness of breath, and cough with sputum production due to airways and lung damage. Infection can trigger severe symptoms, with breathing becoming worse and increased cough and sputum. This is more commonly known as an exacerbation or 'flare-up' which can cause further damage to lung function. Frequent exacerbations can lead to hospital admissions, reduced quality of life, and increase the risk of death.
We wanted to know whether one preventative antibiotic was better than another preventative antibiotic in reducing exacerbations, and improving quality of life for people with COPD.
We found two randomised trials, including 391 people with COPD. The participants had an average age of 68 years. The first study included three groups of COPD patients taking either moxifloxacin (daily for 5 days every 4 weeks), doxycycline (daily for 13 weeks) or azithromycin (3 times per week for 13 weeks). The second study investigated the use of doxycycline (daily) in addition to roxithromycin (daily) for 12 weeks in COPD. Our main outcomes were number of exacerbations, quality of life, serious side effects (known as 'adverse events') and antibiotic resistance.
Overall, we were unable to determine any difference between one antibiotic compared with each other in improving the main outcomes we measured.
We were unclear whether one antibiotic was better or worse than another in terms of reducing exacerbations or improving quality of life. Neither of the studies reported a comparison between antibiotics for drug resistance.
In one study lasting 13 weeks we found no serious side effects of taking moxifloxacin, azithromycin or doxycycline, and no deaths were reported. In the other study, very similar numbers of people experienced serious side effects in both the combined antibiotic and single antibiotic treatment groups after 12 weeks of treatment and 48 weeks of follow-up. However, the numbers were small so we are not sure if one treatment option may cause more side effects than the other. In the same study, five people in the combined treatment group died, compared to three people in the single treatment group. Again, these numbers are too small to draw any conclusions.
We were very uncertain about the results due to finding only two small studies that gave people with COPD antibiotics for only 12 or 13 weeks. The studies only looked at four different antibiotics and did not measure all the things we were interested in.",1080,Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; exacerbations; moxifloxacin; doxycycline; azithromycin; roxithromycin; inhaled corticosteroids; Chlamydophila pneumoniae; adverse events; antibiotic resistance,"If no evidence for a single advantageous antibiotic is proven, what could be a reason to continue researching different antibiotics in COPD?",What is the primary motivation of the study regarding COPD management?,Select all of the following that are colors,Summarize the conclusion about antibiotic efficacy mentioned in the summary.,Describe the overall certainty of the study's results.,To explore variations in individual patient responses.; To eliminate the need for antibiotics in COPD management.; To investigate impacts on disease progression not yet identified.,To explore variations in individual patient responses.; To investigate impacts on disease progression not yet identified.,To find a clear link between antibiotic use and increased lung function.; To compare the effectiveness of different antibiotics in preventing exacerbations.; To determine the impact of COPD on heart disease.,To compare the effectiveness of different antibiotics in preventing exacerbations.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,One preventative antibiotic was significantly better than others in reducing exacerbations.; No clear difference was determined between antibiotics in improving outcomes.; Macrolides were shown to be the most effective.,No clear difference was determined between antibiotics in improving outcomes.,Highly certain due to large sample size.; Very uncertain due to limited sample size and duration.; Moderately certain with strong evidence.,Very uncertain due to limited sample size and duration.
62ac706d8544dbe5a81b4212,finetuned_6,Benefits and harms of antibiotics for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease,"Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of mortality worldwide with approximately 7.4 million deaths each year. People with established coronary heart disease have a high risk of subsequent cardiovascular events including myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death. Antibiotics might prevent such outcomes due to their antibacterial, antiinflammatory, and antioxidative effects. However, a randomised clinical trial and several observational studies have suggested that antibiotics may increase the risk of cardiovascular events and mortality. Furthermore, several non-Cochrane Reviews, that are now outdated, have assessed the effects of antibiotics for coronary heart disease and have shown conflicting results. No previous systematic review using Cochrane methodology has assessed the effects of antibiotics for coronary heart disease. We assessed the benefits and harms of antibiotics compared with placebo or no intervention for the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, SCI-EXPANDED, and BIOSIS in December 2019 in order to identify relevant trials. Additionally, we searched TRIP, Google Scholar, and nine trial registries in December 2019. We also contacted 11 pharmaceutical companies and searched the reference lists of included trials, previous systematic reviews, and other types of reviews. Randomised clinical trials assessing the effects of antibiotics versus placebo or no intervention for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease in adult participants (?18 years) were included irrespective of setting, blinding, publication status, publication year, language, and reporting of outcomes. Three review authors independently extracted data. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, serious adverse event according to ICH-GCP, and quality of life. Secondary outcomes were cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, and sudden cardiac death. The primary time point of interest was at maximum follow-up, and data were also extracted at 24±6 months follow-up. Risks of systematic errors were assessed using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool, and risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated. We included 38 trials randomising 26,638 participants (mean age 61.6 years), with 23/38 trials reporting data on 26,078 participants suitable for meta-analysis. Three trials were at low risk of bias and the remaining 35 were at high risk of bias. Trials assessing macrolides (28 trials; 22,059 participants) and quinolones (two trials; 4162 participants) contributed most of the data. Meta-analyses at maximum follow-up showed that antibiotics versus placebo or no intervention seemed to increase the risk of all-cause mortality (RR 1.06; 95% CI 0.99 to 1.13), stroke (RR 1.14; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.29), and probably also cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.11; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.25). Little to no difference was observed for myocardial infarction (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.88 to 1.03) and sudden cardiac death (RR 1.08; 95% CI 0.90 to 1.31). Meta-analyses at 24±6 months follow-up showed that antibiotics increased the risk of all-cause mortality (RR 1.25; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.48), cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.50; 95% CI 1.17 to 1.91), and probably also sudden cardiac death (RR 1.77; 95% CI 1.28 to 2.44). No evidence of a difference was found for myocardial infarction or stroke at this time point. Meta-analyses of trials at low risk of bias differed only for cardiovascular mortality at maximum follow-up; all other outcomes were consistent with overall analyses. None of the trials specifically assessed serious adverse events according to ICH-GCP, and no data were available on quality of life. Current evidence suggests that antibiotics (macrolides or quinolones) for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease appear harmful when assessing all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and stroke at maximum follow-up, as well as all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and sudden cardiac death at 24±6 months follow-up. Therefore, current evidence does not support the clinical use of macrolides or quinolones for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease. Future trials examining the safety of these antibiotics for this purpose do not seem ethical, and antibiotic trials in general require longer follow-up to capture late adverse events.","Coronary heart disease, also known as cardiovascular disease, is the leading cause of death worldwide with approximately 7.4 million deaths each year. Coronary heart disease is caused by decreased blood supply to the heart. The severity of the disease ranges from chest pain during exercise to heart attack. Antibiotics might help patients with coronary heart disease and reduce their risk of heart attacks, strokes, chest pain, revascularisation procedures, and death. However, a randomised clinical trial and several observational studies suggested that antibiotics increased the risk of cardiovascular events and death. The aim of this Cochrane systematic review was to assess the benefits and harms of antibiotics in adult patients with coronary heart disease. We primarily assessed the benefits and harms at maximum follow-up and secondly at 24±6 months follow-up. We searched various scientific databases from their inception to December 2019 and found 38 trials where people with coronary heart disease were randomly allocated to antibiotics versus placebo or no intervention. The 38 trials included 26,638 adults with a mean age of 61.6 years. 23 out of the 38 trials reported data on 26,078 participants that could be analysed. The vast majority of the data was contributed by trials assessing the effects of macrolide antibiotics (28 trials; 22,059 participants) and quinolone antibiotics (two trials; 4162 participants), while insufficient data were contributed by trials assessing the effects of tetracycline antibiotics (eight trials; 417 participants). Three trials were at low risk of bias and the remaining trials were at high risk of bias. Patients receiving antibiotics (macrolide antibiotics or quinolone antibiotics) compared with patients receiving placebo or no intervention seemed at a slightly higher risk of death from all causes, death from a cardiac cause, and having a stroke at maximum follow-up. Moreover, a slightly higher risk was also observed when assessing death from all causes, death from a cardiac cause, and sudden death from a cardiac cause at 24±6 months follow-up. None of the trials sufficiently reported the number of participants with serious adverse events. No data were provided on quality of life. Future trials on the safety of macrolide antibiotics or quinolone antibiotics for the secondary prevention in adult patients with coronary heart disease do not seem ethical.",1045,Coronary heart disease; myocardial infarction; stroke; secondary prevention; macrolides; quinolones; placebo; cardiovascular mortality,How might the risk of bias in trials impact the interpretation of results regarding antibiotics for coronary heart disease?,What rationale can be evaluated for not supporting further trials of antibiotics as secondary prevention for coronary heart disease?,Select all of the following that are fruits,What was the primary aim of the Cochrane systematic review?,What was the result of the meta-analyses at maximum follow-up regarding all-cause mortality?,They could overestimate the beneficial effects of antibiotics; They ensure that the results are more reliable; They could lead to underreporting of adverse events,They could overestimate the beneficial effects of antibiotics; They could lead to underreporting of adverse events,Evidence indicates potential harm in terms of mortality; Antibiotics have consistently shown beneficial effects; Concerns about ethical considerations in patient safety,Evidence indicates potential harm in terms of mortality; Concerns about ethical considerations in patient safety,dog; blue; grape,grape,To assess the benefits and harms of antibiotics in adult patients with coronary heart disease.; To compare different types of antibiotics for various diseases.; To evaluate the effectiveness of new surgical procedures for heart disease.,To assess the benefits and harms of antibiotics in adult patients with coronary heart disease.,Antibiotics increased the risk of all-cause mortality.; Antibiotics decreased the risk of all-cause mortality.; There was no difference in all-cause mortality.,Antibiotics increased the risk of all-cause mortality.
568899d9d7848e0005399c6b,static_1,What are the benefits and risks of eye drops that widen the pupil as an additional treatment for inflammation after a blow to the eye?,"Traumatic eye complaints account for 3% of all hospital emergency department visits. The most common traumatic injury to the eye is blunt trauma, which accounts for 30% of these visits. Blunt trauma frequently leads to traumatic iridocyclitis, thus causing anterior uveitis. Iridocyclitis frequently causes tearing, photophobia, eye pain, and vision loss. These symptoms are a result of the inflammatory processes and ciliary spasms to iris muscles and sphincter. The inflammatory process is usually managed with topical corticosteroids, while the ciliary spasm is blunted by dilating the pupils with topical mydriatic agents, an adjuvant therapy. However, the effectiveness of mydriatic agents has not been quantified in terms of reduction of ocular pain and visual acuity loss.
To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of topical mydriatics as adjunctive therapy to topical corticosteroids for traumatic iridocyclitis.
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register (2019, issue 6); Ovid MEDLINE; Embase.com; Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) Plus; PubMed; ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic search for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 12 June 2019.
We planned to include randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared topical mydriatic agents in conjunction with topical corticosteroid therapy versus topical corticosteroids alone, in participants with traumatic iridocyclitis.
Two review authors (JH, MK) independently screened titles and abstracts, then full-text reports, against eligibility criteria. We planned to have two authors independently extract data from included studies. We resolved differences in opinion by discussion.
There were no eligible RCTs that compared the interventions of interest in people with traumatic iridocyclitis.
We did not find any evidence from RCTs about the efficacy of topical mydriatic agents as an adjunctive therapy with topical corticosteroids for treating traumatic iridocyclitis. In the absence of these types of studies, we cannot draw any firm conclusions. Controlled trials that compare the combined use of topical mydriatic agents and corticosteroid drops against standard corticosteroid drops alone, in people with traumatic iridocyclitis are required. These may provide evidence about the efficacy and risk of topical mydriatic drops as adjuvant therapy for traumatic iridocyclitis.","Hospital emergency departments often treat people with eye injuries. There are two main types of eye injuries: blunt trauma injuries, when an object or force strikes the eye, commonly caused by motor vehicle accidents, sports- or work-related accidents, or fights; and penetrating trauma injuries, when a sharp object or an object traveling at high speed (for example, pellets from air-powered guns) pierces the eye. Blunt trauma is the more common type of injury. People who experience these injuries often develop traumatic iridocyclitis, an inflammation of the iris (the colored part of the eye surrounding the pupil) and the ciliary body (the muscles and tissues around the iris). Traumatic iridocyclitis can develop after both major and minor blunt trauma and can affect both children and adults. Symptoms include eye pain and sensitivity to light. If the inflammation is missed or not treated properly, it can lead to vision loss. The standard treatment for traumatic iridocyclitis is anti-inflammatory eye drops (corticosteroids). Eye drops that widen the pupil (mydriatics) are often added to reduce pain and discomfort and to shorten the duration of symptoms. We aimed to determine whether using mydriatics alongside corticosteroids is more beneficial or causes more unwanted effects than using corticosteroids alone. Specifically, we wanted to know if mydriatics relieve pain and inflammation and improve vision, and whether they cause complications such as chronic pain or serious harm to vision, including blindness. Our team searched the medical literature for randomized controlled trials the most reliable type of study on people of any age with traumatic iridocyclitis that compared mydriatics plus corticosteroids against corticosteroids alone. We found no randomized controlled trials addressing this question. Therefore, we do not know whether adding mydriatics to corticosteroids is helpful or harmful compared with corticosteroids alone. More research is needed, including well-designed trials, to understand the benefits and risks of using mydriatics as an additional treatment for traumatic iridocyclitis.",1053,Topical mydriatic agents; Topical corticosteroids; Traumatic iridocyclitis; Blunt trauma; Anterior uveitis; Ciliary spasms; Photophobia; Inflammatory processes; Adjunctive therapy; Ocular pain,How might the lack of randomized controlled trials affect the implementation of mydriatic agents in clinical practice for traumatic iridocyclitis?,What is the intended benefit of adding mydriatics to corticosteroid treatment for traumatic iridocyclitis?,Select the items that are animals,Describe the condition known as traumatic iridocyclitis.,What standard treatment is used for traumatic iridocyclitis?,"Clinicians may hesitate to use mydriatics due to unclear benefits and risks.; Clinicians can confidently prescribe mydriatics, assuming they're safe.; Clinicians should replace corticosteroids with mydriatics alone.",Clinicians may hesitate to use mydriatics due to unclear benefits and risks.,To relieve pain and improve vision; To reduce allergic reactions; To prevent infection,To relieve pain and improve vision,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,An inflammation of the iris and ciliary body; A breakdown of the retina; A swelling of the cornea,An inflammation of the iris and ciliary body,Anti-inflammatory eye drops (corticosteroids); Antibiotic ointments; Laser eye surgery,Anti-inflammatory eye drops (corticosteroids)
568899d9d7848e0005399c6b,static_2,Cannabis-based medicines for cancer pain,"Pain is a common symptom in people with cancer; 30% to 50% of people with cancer will experience moderate-to-severe pain. This can have a major negative impact on their quality of life. Opioid (morphine-like) medications are commonly used to treat moderate or severe cancer pain, and are recommended for this purpose in the World Health Organization (WHO) pain treatment ladder. Pain is not sufficiently relieved by opioid medications in 10% to 15% of people with cancer. In people with insufficient relief of cancer pain, new analgesics are needed to effectively and safely supplement or replace opioids. To evaluate the benefits and harms of cannabis-based medicines, including medical cannabis, for treating pain and other symptoms in adults with cancer compared to placebo or any other established analgesic for cancer pain. We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 26 January 2023. We selected double-blind randomised, controlled trials (RCT) of medical cannabis, plant-derived and synthetic cannabis-based medicines against placebo or any other active treatment for cancer pain in adults, with any treatment duration and at least 10 participants per treatment arm. We used standard Cochrane methods. The primary outcomes were 1. proportions of participants reporting no worse than mild pain; 2. Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) of much improved or very much improved and 3. withdrawals due to adverse events. Secondary outcomes were 4. number of participants who reported pain relief of 30% or greater and overall opioid use reduced or stable; 5. number of participants who reported pain relief of 30% or greater, or 50% or greater; 6. pain intensity; 7. sleep problems; 8. depression and anxiety; 9. daily maintenance and breakthrough opioid dosage; 10. dropouts due to lack of efficacy; 11. all central nervous system adverse events. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence for each outcome. We identified 14 studies involving 1823 participants. No study assessed the proportions of participants reporting no worse than mild pain on treatment by 14 days after start of treatment. We found five RCTs assessing oromucosal nabiximols (tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD)) or THC alone involving 1539 participants with moderate or severe pain despite opioid therapy. The double-blind periods of the RCTs ranged between two and five weeks. Four studies with a parallel design and 1333 participants were available for meta-analysis. There was moderate-certainty evidence that there was no clinically relevant benefit for proportions of PGIC much or very much improved (risk difference (RD) 0.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 0.12; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 16, 95% CI 8 to 100). There was moderate-certainty evidence for no clinically relevant difference in the proportion of withdrawals due to adverse events (RD 0.04, 95% CI 0 to 0.08; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 25, 95% CI 16 to endless). There was moderate-certainty evidence for no difference between nabiximols or THC and placebo in the frequency of serious adverse events (RD 0.02, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.07). There was moderate-certainty evidence that nabiximols and THC used as add-on treatment for opioid-refractory cancer pain did not differ from placebo in reducing mean pain intensity (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.19, 95% CI -0.40 to 0.02). There was low-certainty evidence that a synthetic THC analogue (nabilone) delivered over eight weeks was not superior to placebo in reducing pain associated with chemotherapy or radiochemotherapy in people with head and neck cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (2 studies, 89 participants, qualitative analysis). Analyses of tolerability and safety were not possible for these studies. There was low-certainty evidence that synthetic THC analogues were superior to placebo (SMD -0.98, 95% CI -1.36 to -0.60), but not superior to low-dose codeine (SMD 0.03, 95% CI -0.25 to 0.32; 5 single-dose trials; 126 participants) in reducing moderate-to-severe cancer pain after cessation of previous analgesic treatment for three to four and a half hours (2 single-dose trials; 66 participants). Analyses of tolerability and safety were not possible for these studies. There was low-certainty evidence that CBD oil did not add value to specialist palliative care alone in the reduction of pain intensity in people with advanced cancer. There was no difference in the number of dropouts due to adverse events and serious adverse events (1 study, 144 participants, qualitative analysis). We found no studies using herbal cannabis. There is moderate-certainty evidence that oromucosal nabiximols and THC are ineffective in relieving moderate-to-severe opioid-refractory cancer pain. There is low-certainty evidence that nabilone is ineffective in reducing pain associated with (radio-) chemotherapy in people with head and neck cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. There is low-certainty evidence that a single dose of synthetic THC analogues is not superior to a single low-dose morphine equivalent in reducing moderate-to-severe cancer pain. There is low-certainty evidence that CBD does not add value to specialist palliative care alone in the reduction of pain in people with advanced cancer.","One person in two or three who gets cancer will have pain that becomes moderate or severe in intensity. The pain tends to get worse as the cancer progresses.
The WHO recommends taking morphine-like medicines for moderate-to-severe pain from cancer, but 1 in 6 to 10 people with cancer pain do not experience sufficient pain relief from morphine-like medicines. Several products based on the cannabis plant have been suggested as treatment for cancer pain. These products include inhaled or orally ingested herbal cannabis, and various oils, sprays or tablets containing active cannabis ingredients obtained from the plant, or made synthetically. Some people with cancer pain have reported that CbMs are effective for them, and that is often highlighted in the media.
If CbMs relieved cancer pain in people living with cancer.
If CbMs were associated with any unwanted or harmful effects.
We searched for clinical trials that examined CbMs compared to other medications to treat cancer pain in adults.
We summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as the methods and size of studies.
We found 14 studies involving 1823 people. The biggest study included 399 people and the smallest study included 10 people.
Studies were conducted in countries around the world; most (six) were based in North America.
Five studies used one dose of CbM and lasted less than one day. Other studies lasted between two and eight weeks.
Pharmaceutical companies funded seven studies.
Six studies compared a mouth spray with a plant-derived combination of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the principal psychoactive constituent of cannabis, and cannabidiol (CBD), an anti-inflammatory ingredient of cannabis, against a fake medication (placebo). Seven studies compared an artificial cannabinoid mimicking the effects of THC against placebo. Of these seven studies, two studies compared against a morphine-like medication (codeine), too. One study compared CBD against placebo.
We did not find studies with herbal cannabis.
Mouth spray with a plant-derived combination of THC and CBD was probably not better than placebo in reducing pain in people with moderate-to-severe cancer pain despite opioid treatment. Thirty-two out of 100 people reported to be much or very much improved by cannabis-based mouth spray and 23 out of 100 people with mouth spray with placebo. A total of 19 out of 100 people withdrew early because of side effects by cannabis-based mouth spray and 16 out of 100 people by mouth spray with placebo. There was no difference in serious side effects between the cannabis-based mouth spray and a placebo mouth spray.
Artificial cannabinoid mimicking the effects of THC may not be better than a fake medication in reducing pain associated with chemotherapy or radiochemotherapy in people with head and neck cancer and a certain type of lung cancer.
A single dose of an artificial cannabinoid mimicking the effects of THC may be better than a single dose of placebo, but may not differ from a single small dose of a morphine-like medication in reducing moderate-to-severe cancer pain after cessation of previous analgesic treatment for three to four and a half hours.
CBD may not add value to specialist palliative care alone in the reduction of pain in people with advanced cancer.
We found no studies with medical cannabis.
We are moderately confident in the evidence that a mouth spray with a plant-derived combination of THC and CBD does not reduce severe cancer pain despite opioid treatment because studies did not provide information about everything that we could have used.

A thorough understanding of the current body of evidence regarding benefits and risks of this intervention is required. To assess the effectiveness and safety of convalescent plasma transfusion in the treatment of people with COVID-19; and to maintain the currency of the evidence using a living systematic review approach. To identify completed and ongoing studies, we searched the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease Research Database, MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, and the Epistemonikos COVID-19 L*OVE Platform. We searched monthly until 03 March 2022. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating convalescent plasma for COVID-19, irrespective of disease severity, age, gender or ethnicity. We excluded studies that included populations with other coronavirus diseases (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)), as well as studies evaluating standard immunoglobulin. We followed standard Cochrane methodology. To assess bias in included studies we used RoB 2. We used the GRADE approach to rate the certainty of evidence for the following outcomes: all-cause mortality at up to day 28, worsening and improvement of clinical status (for individuals with moderate to severe disease), hospital admission or death, COVID-19 symptoms resolution (for individuals with mild disease), quality of life, grade 3 or 4 adverse events, and serious adverse events. In this fourth review update version, we included 33RCTs with 24,861 participants, of whom 11,432 received convalescent plasma. Of these, nine studies are single-centre studies and 24 are multi-centre studies. Fourteen studies took place in America, eight in Europe, three in South-East Asia, two in Africa, two in western Pacific and three in eastern Mediterranean regions and one in multiple regions. We identified a further 49 ongoingstudies evaluating convalescent plasma, and 33 studies reporting as being completed. Individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and moderate to severe disease 29 RCTs investigated the use of convalescent plasma for 22,728 participants with moderate to severe disease. 23 RCTs with 22,020 participants compared convalescent plasma to placebo or standard care alone, five compared to standard plasma and one compared to human immunoglobulin. We evaluate subgroups on detection of antibodies detection, symptom onset, country income groups and several co-morbidities in the full text. Convalescent plasma versus placebo or standard care alone Convalescent plasma does not reduce all-cause mortality at up to day 28 (risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92 to 1.03; 220 per 1000; 21 RCTs, 19,021 participants; high-certainty evidence). It has little to no impact on need for invasive mechanical ventilation, or death (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.11; 296 per 1000; 6 RCTs, 14,477 participants; high-certainty evidence) and has no impact on whether participants are discharged from hospital (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.02; 665 per 1000; 6 RCTs, 12,721 participants; high-certainty evidence).

Convalescent plasma may have little to no impact on the risk of grades 3 and 4 adverse events (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.42; 212 per 1000; 6 RCTs, 2392 participants; low-certainty evidence). It has probably little to no effect on the risk of serious adverse events (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.44; 135 per 1000; 6 RCTs, 3901 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Convalescent plasma versus standard plasma We are uncertain whether convalescent plasma reduces or increases all-cause mortality at up to day 28 (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.19; 129 per 1000; 4 RCTs, 484 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether convalescent plasma reduces or increases the need for invasive mechanical ventilation, or death (RR 5.59, 95% CI 0.29 to 108.38; 311 per 1000; 1 study, 34 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and whether it reduces or increases the risk of serious adverse events (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.15; 236 per 1000; 3 RCTs, 327 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We did not identify any study reporting other key outcomes. Convalescent plasma versus human immunoglobulin Convalescent plasma may have little to no effect on all-cause mortality at up to day 28 (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.50; 464 per 1000; 1 study, 190 participants; low-certainty evidence). We did not identify any study reporting other key outcomes. Individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and mild disease We identified two RCTs reporting on 536 participants, comparing convalescent plasma to placebo or standard care alone, and two RCTs reporting on 1597 participants with mild disease, comparing convalescent plasma to standard plasma. Convalescent plasma versus placebo or standard care alone We are uncertain whether convalescent plasma reduces all-cause mortality at up to day 28 (odds ratio (OR) 0.36, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.46; 8 per 1000; 2 RCTs, 536 participants; very low-certainty evidence). It may have little to no effect on admission to hospital or death within 28 days (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.84; 117 per 1000; 1 RCT, 376 participants; low-certainty evidence), on time to COVID-19 symptom resolution (hazard ratio (HR) 1.05, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.30; 483 per 1000; 1 RCT, 376 participants; low-certainty evidence), on the risk of grades 3 and 4 adverse events (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.75 to 2.19; 144 per 1000; 1 RCT, 376 participants; low-certainty evidence) and the risk of serious adverse events (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.94; 133 per 1000; 1 RCT, 376 participants; low-certainty evidence). We did not identify any study reporting other key outcomes. Convalescent plasma versus standard plasma We are uncertain whether convalescent plasma reduces all-cause mortality at up to day 28 (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.75; 2 per 1000; 2 RCTs, 1597 participants; very low-certainty evidence). It probably reduces admission to hospital or death within 28 days (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.75; 36 per 1000; 2 RCTs, 1595 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Convalescent plasma may have little to no effect on initial symptom resolution at up to day 28 (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.27; 1 RCT, 416 participants; low-certainty evidence). We did not identify any study reporting other key outcomes. This is a living systematic review. We search monthly for new evidence and update the review when we identify relevant new evidence. For the comparison of convalescent plasma versus placebo or standard care alone, our certainty in the evidence that convalescent plasma for individuals with moderate to severe disease does not reduce mortality and has little to no impact on clinical improvement or worsening is high. It probably has little to no effect on SAEs. For individuals with mild disease, we have very-low to low certainty evidence for most primary outcomes and moderate certainty for hospital admission or death. There are 49 ongoing studies, and 33 studies reported as complete in a trials registry. Publication of ongoing studies might resolve some of the uncertainties around convalescent plasma therapy for people with asymptomatic or mild disease.","Convalescent plasma is plasma containing antibodies produced by the body as a defence against infection, taken from people who have recovered from COVID-19 and used to make treatment that can be given by a drip or injection; while generally well-tolerated, it can cause unwanted effects. We wanted to find out whether convalescent plasma is an effective treatment for people with confirmed COVID-19, looking at deaths from any cause after treatment, worsening of patients' condition measured by the number of people needing ventilator support or who died, improvement measured by hospital discharge, quality of life, and unwanted effects. We searched for studies worldwide that investigated convalescent plasma in people of any age, gender, ethnicity, and with mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19, pooled results when possible, and rated our confidence based on study methods and sizes. We found 33 studies with 24,861 participants, including 29 studies in moderate to severe COVID-19 and four in mild disease, mostly conducted in hospitals worldwide; the findings compare convalescent plasma with placebo or standard care. For people with moderate to severe COVID-19, convalescent plasma makes no difference to deaths within 28 days (about 225 in 1000 died vs 220 in 1000 given plasma), makes little to no difference in needing invasive mechanical ventilation or dying (287 in 1000 vs 296 in 1000), and makes no difference to being discharged from hospital (665 in 1000 in both groups). It probably makes no difference to serious unwanted effects (118 in 1000 vs 133 in 1000) and may result in no difference in quality of life. For people with mild COVID-19, convalescent plasma may result in no difference in deaths within 28 days (22 in 1000 on placebo/standard care vs 9 in 1000 on plasma), may result in no difference in admission to hospital or death within 28 days (112 in 1000 vs 117 in 1000), may result in no difference in the time until symptoms resolved, and may result in no difference in serious unwanted effects. The limitations of the evidence are that we are very confident in the evidence for deaths, worsening, and improvement in moderate to severe COVID-19 due to consistent high-quality studies, but confidence in other evidence for moderate, severe, and mild COVID-19 is limited because we could not identify enough consistent results; there is still little evidence on quality of life and for people with mild disease, and none for those without COVID-19 symptoms.",1108,Convalescent plasma; viral respiratory diseases; coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS); Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS); RoB 2; mechanical ventilation; quality of life; human immunoglobulin; SARS-CoV-2 infection,What inference can be drawn about the impact of convalescent plasma on deaths within 28 days for patients with moderate to severe COVID-19?,What is the estimated effectiveness of convalescent plasma in improving the quality of life for patients with moderate to severe COVID-19?,Select all of the following that are colors,What conclusion can be drawn about the unwanted effects of convalescent plasma therapy for moderate to severe COVID-19?,What hypothesis could be formulated for further studies to resolve uncertainties about convalescent plasma in asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 cases?,"Convalescent plasma significantly reduces mortality.; Convalescent plasma has no impact on mortality compared to placebo or standard care.; The evidence shows mixed results, making it inconclusive.",Convalescent plasma has no impact on mortality compared to placebo or standard care.,The plasma significantly improves quality of life.; There is little to no difference in quality of life compared to standard care.; The evidence on quality of life was robust and conclusive.,There is little to no difference in quality of life compared to standard care.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Convalescent plasma likely increases serious unwanted effects.; The therapy probably makes no difference in the occurrence of serious unwanted effects.; The therapy has a clear difference in reducing unwanted effects.,The therapy probably makes no difference in the occurrence of serious unwanted effects.,Convalescent plasma significantly enhances symptom resolution.; Further large-scale studies will clarify its impact on mild cases.; More randomised trials are unnecessary based on current evidence.,Further large-scale studies will clarify its impact on mild cases.
568899d9d7848e0005399c6b,interactive_3,Bezafibrate for primary biliary cirrhosis,"Treatment of primary biliary cirrhosis is complicated, and although some studies suggest that bezafibrate, alone or with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), may be effective, no systematic review had summarised the evidence. This review assessed the beneficial and harmful effects of bezafibrate in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. Searches of multiple databases including the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP were conducted up to late 2011, along with Chinese databases up to January 2011, and manufacturers and authors were contacted. All randomised clinical trials comparing bezafibrate at any dose or regimen with placebo, no intervention, or another drug were included, allowing concomitant interventions if equally applied to all groups. Two authors extracted data, and analyses used risk ratios or risk differences for dichotomous data, mean differences for continuous data, and trial sequential analysis to assess random errors. Six trials with 151 Japanese patients were included, all at high risk of bias; four trials compared bezafibrate plus UDCA with no intervention plus UDCA, and two compared bezafibrate with UDCA. No patients died or developed liver-related complications. Bezafibrate had no significant effect on adverse events compared with no intervention (5/32 vs 0/28; RR 5.40, 95% CI 0.69 to 42.32) or UDCA (2/32 vs 0/37; RR 6.19, 95% CI 0.31 to 122.05). Bezafibrate significantly reduced serum alkaline phosphatase activity compared with no intervention (MD -186.04 U/L, 95% CI -249.03 to -123.04) and compared with UDCA (MD -162.90 U/L, 95% CI -199.68 to -126.12), with results supported by trial sequential analyses. Compared with no intervention, bezafibrate also significantly reduced plasma immunoglobulin M (MD -164.00 mg/dl, 95% CI -259.47 to -68.53) and serum bilirubin (MD -0.19 mg/dl, 95% CI -0.38 to -0.00), though these two findings were not supported by trial sequential analyses. Bezafibrate showed no significant effect on serum gamma-glutamyltransferase or alanine aminotransferase compared with no intervention. Compared with UDCA, bezafibrate showed no significant effects on these enzymes or immunoglobulin M in random-effects models, but fixed-effect models suggested significant decreases in all three markers. One patient discontinued bezafibrate due to an adverse event. Overall, bezafibrate showed no effect on mortality, liver-related morbidity, adverse events, or pruritus compared with no intervention or UDCA, and none of the trials assessed quality of life or fatigue. Although bezafibrate may improve some liver biochemical measures, these findings may reflect bias or random error. More rigorous randomised clinical trials are needed.","Primary biliary cirrhosis is a chronic disease of the liver that is characterised by progressive inflammation and destruction of the liver tissue, eventually progressing to liver cirrhosis and the need for liver transplantation. Primary biliary cirrhosis primarily affects middle-aged women. Bezafibrate is a hypolipidaemic agent used in treatment of hypertriglyceridaemia. There are studies suggesting that bezafibrate, alone or in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid, is effective in treatment of primary biliary cirrhosis. Mechanisms through which bezafibrate improves lipid serum concentration balance and prevents biliary cell damage still need to be fully understood. This review evaluates all data on the benefits and harms of bezafibrate for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis in randomised clinical trials. The findings of this review are based on six randomised clinical trials with 151 Japanese patients. Bezafibrate was compared with no intervention in four trials (with co-intervention of ursodeoxycholic acid in both the bezafibrate and control groups) and with ursodeoxycholic acid in two trials. The primary findings of the review are that bezafibrate has no statistically significant effects on mortality, liver-related morbidity, adverse events, and quality of life of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. A possible positive intervention effect of bezafibrate versus no intervention on liver biochemistry measures can be real but could also be due to systematic errors or random errors. The benefits and harms of bezafibrate for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis need further assessment in randomised clinical trials comparing bezafibrate with placebo. Such trials ought to be conducted with impeccable methodology to reduce the risks of random errors and sufficiently large patient groups to reduce the risks of random errors.",1096,bezafibrate; primary biliary cirrhosis; ursodeoxycholic acid; liver-related complications; plasma immunoglobulin M; serum bilirubin; serum gamma-glutamyltransferase; alanine aminotransferase; liver biochemical measures; pruritus,What are the primary motivations for conducting a systematic review on bezafibrate in primary biliary cirrhosis?,How could the findings of this review affect future research directions in liver treatment?,Select all of the following that are colors,How should the potential for systematic or random errors influence the interpretation of bezafibrateÃ¢ÂÂs effects?,What did the trials compare bezafibrate with?,To consolidate existing evidence from scattered studies; To develop new treatment protocols; To address the lack of definitive conclusions regarding its efficacy,To consolidate existing evidence from scattered studies; To address the lack of definitive conclusions regarding its efficacy,By discouraging further trials on bezafibrate; By highlighting the need for rigorously conducted trials; By confirming the current clinical guidelines,By highlighting the need for rigorously conducted trials,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,It should be considered as a major limitation in assessing benefits; It validates the significance of the findings; It suggests that bezafibrate's benefits are entirely due to error,It should be considered as a major limitation in assessing benefits,No intervention and ursodeoxycholic acid; Placebo and vitamins; Dietary changes only,No intervention and ursodeoxycholic acid
568899d9d7848e0005399c6b,interactive_4,Treatment options for people with recurrent and progressive glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly malignant brain tumour that almost always progresses or recurs after standard first-line treatment, and there is no consensus on the most effective therapy once the disease returns. This review evaluated available treatments for first and later recurrence in people previously treated with the standard Stupp protocol and included a brief economic commentary. Searches of major medical databases up to December 2019 identified 42 eligible studies (34 randomised trials and 8 non-randomised studies) involving 5236 participants. Most randomised trials had low risk of bias, while non-randomised studies had high risk of bias. Treatments included chemotherapy, re-operation, re-irradiation, and novel therapies used alone or in combination. For first recurrence, 11 treatments contributed to the overall survival network analysis and eight to the progression-free survival analysis, with lomustine (LOM/CCNU) used as the reference treatment. No included studies in the network meta-analysis evaluated surgery, re-irradiation, PCV, temozolomide (TMZ) rechallenge, or best supportive care, and quality-of-life data were sparse. Median overall survival ranged from 5.5 to 12.6 months and median progression-free survival from 1.5 to 4.2 months. No high-certainty evidence showed any treatment improved survival compared with lomustine. Bevacizumab plus lomustine probably resulted in little or no difference in survival compared with lomustine alone, though it may improve progression-free survival. Bevacizumab alone may offer little or no survival benefit, and evidence remains uncertain. Regorafenib may improve overall survival compared with lomustine but evidence certainty was low. Temozolomide plus Depatux-M (ABT414) may improve survival compared with lomustine or bevacizumab, possibly driven by the temozolomide component, but additional evidence is needed. Fotemustine may have similar effects to lomustine. Evidence for bevacizumab plus irinotecan was very uncertain, and it likely offers little benefit over bevacizumab alone. Ranking analyses placed fotemustine first, followed by bevacizumab plus lomustine, lomustine alone, bevacizumab plus irinotecan, and bevacizumab alone, though ranking does not reflect evidence certainty. Three studies examining re-operation suggested it may extend survival in carefully selected patients. One early-phase study suggested a potential role for a cannabinoid plus temozolomide. Evidence for treatment of second or later recurrence was limited; some heterogeneous studies suggested radiotherapy with or without bevacizumab may improve survival, while tumour-treating fields showed little difference compared with physician's choice. No reliable evidence was found for best supportive care. Severe adverse events were significantly more common with bevacizumab plus lomustine than with lomustine alone and were similarly high with cediranib plus lomustine. Lomustine alone had the lowest rate of severe adverse events, followed by regorafenib. Combinations that added novel agents to bevacizumab generally increased toxicity. Overall, combination treatments for first recurrence did not improve survival compared with lomustine monotherapy and were often associated with more severe adverse events. Re-operation and re-irradiation may benefit selected individuals. Evidence for later recurrences remains sparse, and more high-quality research is needed.","Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a very aggressive brain tumour that often continues to grow even after surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, and almost always comes back. Many different treatments have been tested for tumour progression or recurrence, but there is no agreement on which option is best. This review evaluated treatments for people whose GBM progressed or recurred after receiving standard initial care. A total of 42 studies involving 5236 people were included. Treatments examined included chemotherapy, re-operation, re-irradiation, and newer therapies used alone or in combination. For first recurrence, none of the treatments showed clear evidence of being better than lomustine (CCNU). Adding bevacizumab to lomustine did not improve overall survival, and most other agents either had uncertain benefits or did not improve outcomes. Several commonly used treatments such as PCV and temozolomide re-challenge were not represented in the available evidence. Limited evidence suggested that a second surgery, with or without additional therapies, may offer some survival benefit in selected individuals. For second or later recurrence, evidence was too limited for statistical analysis, but radiotherapy with or without bevacizumab might offer some benefit, though this is uncertain. Serious side effects occurred with many treatments, and combining bevacizumab with lomustine resulted in more severe adverse events than lomustine alone. Overall, lomustine appears to be the most effective chemotherapy option for first recurrence, and other combination therapies generally carried higher risks without clear benefits. A second surgery or radiotherapy may be helpful for some individuals. For later recurrences, evidence is sparse and uncertain.

568899d9d7848e0005399c6b,interactive_4,Using computers to self-manage type 2 diabetes,"Diabetes is one of the commonest chronic medical conditions, affecting around 347 million adults worldwide. Structured patient education programmes reduce the risk of diabetes-related complications four-fold. Internet-based self-management programmes have been shown to be effective for a number of long-term conditions, but it is unclear what are the essential or effective components of such programmes. If computer-based self-management interventions improve outcomes in type 2 diabetes, they could potentially provide a cost-effective option for reducing the burdens placed on patients and healthcare systems by this long-term condition.
To assess the effects on health status and health-related quality of life of computer-based diabetes self-management interventions for adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
We searched six electronic bibliographic databases for published articles and conference proceedings and three online databases for theses (all up to November 2011). Reference lists of relevant reports and reviews were also screened.
Randomised controlled trials of computer-based self-management interventions for adults with type 2 diabetes, i.e. computer-based software applications that respond to user input and aim to generate tailored content to improve one or more self-management domains through feedback, tailored advice, reinforcement and rewards, patient decision support, goal setting or reminders.
Two review authors independently screened the abstracts and extracted data. A taxonomy for behaviour change techniques was used to describe the active ingredients of the intervention.
We identified 16 randomised controlled trials with 3578 participants that fitted our inclusion criteria. These studies included a wide spectrum of interventions covering clinic-based brief interventions, Internet-based interventions that could be used from home and mobile phone-based interventions. The mean age of participants was between 46 to 67 years old and mean time since diagnosis was 6 to 13 years. The duration of the interventions varied between 1 to 12 months. There were three reported deaths out of 3578 participants. Computer-based diabetes self-management interventions currently have limited effectiveness. They appear to have small benefits on glycaemic control (pooled effect on glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c): -2.3 mmol/mol or -0.2% (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.4 to -0.1; P = 0.009; 2637 participants; 11 trials). The effect size on HbA1c was larger in the mobile phone subgroup (subgroup analysis: mean difference in HbA1c -5.5 mmol/mol or -0.5% (95% CI -0.7 to -0.3); P < 0.00001; 280 participants; three trials). Current interventions do not show adequate evidence for improving depression, health-related quality of life or weight. Four (out of 10) interventions showed beneficial effects on lipid profile. One participant withdrew because of anxiety but there were no other documented adverse effects. Two studies provided limited cost-effectiveness data - with one study suggesting costs per patient of less than $140 (in 1997) or 105 EURO and another study showed no change in health behaviour and resource utilisation.
Computer-based diabetes self-management interventions to manage type 2 diabetes appear to have a small beneficial effect on blood glucose control and the effect was larger in the mobile phone subgroup. There is no evidence to show benefits in other biological outcomes or any cognitive, behavioural or emotional outcomes.","Diabetes is one of the commonest long-term medical conditions, affecting around 347 million adults worldwide. Around 90% of them have type 2 diabetes and are at significant risk of developing diabetes related complications such as strokes or heart attacks. Patient education programmes can reduce the risk of diabetes-related complications, but many people with type 2 diabetes have never attended structured education programmes to learn how to look after themselves (self-management). Better use of computers might be one way of helping more people learn about self-management.
We identified 16 trials involving 3578 adults that met our criteria. These studies included different types of interventions used in different places like touch screen computers in hospital clinics, computers connected to the Internet at home and programmes that communicated with mobile phones. The average age of people taking part was between 46 to 67 years old and most of those people had lived with diabetes for 6 to 13 years. Participants were given access to the interventions for 1 to 12 months, depending on the intervention. Three out of the 3578 participants died but these deaths did not appear to be linked to the trials.
Overall, there is evidence that computer programmes have a small beneficial effect on blood sugar control - the estimated improvement in glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c - a long-term measurement of metabolic control) was 2.3 mmol/mol or 0.2%. This was slightly higher when we looked at studies that used mobile phones to deliver their intervention - the estimated improvement in HbA1c was 5.5 mmol/mol or 0.5% in the studies that used mobile phones. Some of the programmes lowered cholesterol slightly. None of the programmes helped with weight loss or coping with depression.
One participant withdrew because of anxiety but there were no obvious side effects and hypoglycaemic episodes were not reported in any of the studies. There was very little information about costs or value for money.

568899d9d7848e0005399c6b,finetuned_5,Insulin detemir versus insulin glargine for type 2 diabetes mellitus,"Chronically elevated blood glucose levels are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Many diabetes patients will eventually require insulin treatment to maintain good glycaemic control. There are still uncertainties about the optimal insulin treatment regimens for type 2 diabetes, but the long-acting insulin analogues seem beneficial. Several reviews have compared either insulin detemir or insulin glargine to NPH insulin, but research directly comparing both insulin analogues is limited.
To assess the effects of insulin detemir and insulin glargine compared with each other in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, online registries of ongoing trials and abstract books. Date of last search was January 2011.
All randomised controlled trials comparing insulin detemir with insulin glargine with a duration of 12 weeks or longer were included.
Two authors independently selected the studies and extracted the data. Pooling of studies by means of random-effects meta-analysis was performed.
This review examined four trials lasting 24 to 52 weeks involving 2250 people randomised to either insulin detemir or glargine. Overall, risk of bias of the evaluated studies was high. Insulin glargine was dosed once-daily in the evening. Insulin detemir was initiated once-daily in the evening with the option of an additional dose in the morning in three studies and initiated twice-daily in one study. Of randomised patients 13.6% to 57.2% were injecting insulin detemir twice-daily at the end of trial. Glycaemic control, measured by glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and HbA1c equal to or less than 7% with or without hypoglycaemia, did not differ statistically significantly between treatment groups. The results showed no significant differences in overall, nocturnal and severe hypoglycaemia between treatment groups. Insulin detemir was associated with less weight gain. Treatment with insulin glargine resulted in a lower daily basal insulin dose and a lower number of injection site reactions. There was no significant difference in the variability of FPG or glucose values in 24-hour profiles between treatment groups. It was not possible to draw conclusions on quality of life, costs or mortality. Only one trial reported results on health-related quality of life and showed no significant differences between treatment groups.
Our analyses suggest that there is no clinically relevant difference in efficacy or safety between insulin detemir and insulin glargine for targeting hyperglycaemia. However, to achieve the same glycaemic control insulin detemir was often injected twice-daily in a higher dose but with less weight gain, while insulin glargine was injected once-daily, with somewhat fewer injection site reactions.","The two long-acting insulin analogues (artificial insulins), insulin detemir or insulin glargine differ in their mechanism of attaining protracted action, leading to possible differences in glycaemic control and safety outcomes. Several studies have compared either insulin detemir or insulin glargine to NPH (Neutral Protamin Hagedorn) insulin. Research directly comparing both long-acting insulin analogues is limited.
Our aim was to systematically review the efficacy and safety of insulin detemir and insulin glargine in head-to-head studies in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Four studies investigated a total of 2250 people. Trials lasted between 24 and 52 weeks. Overall, risk of bias of the evaluated studies was high. Our analysis of these intermediate term trials comparing insulin detemir with insulin glargine showed that these two insulins were equally effective in achieving and maintaining glycaemic control (glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)). There were no differences in overall, nocturnal and severe hypoglycaemia when comparing insulin detemir to insulin glargine. Insulin detemir was associated with significantly less weight gain (one study showing a difference of 0.9 kg). Treatment with insulin glargine resulted in a lower daily basal insulin dose and a lower number of injection site reactions (1.8% of patients treated with insulin detemir compared to 0.4% of patients treated with insulin glargine had injection side reactions).
There was no difference in the variability of fasting glucose levels or the variability of glucose values of 24-hour profiles between the two treatment groups.
From the retrieved trials it was not possible to draw conclusions on the effects of these two insulins on quality of life, their costs or on the number of fatalities. Only one trial reported results on health-related quality of life and showed no significant differences between treatment groups.
Our analyses suggest that there is no clinically relevant difference in the efficacy or the safety between the use of insulin detemir and insulin glargine for treating type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, to achieve the same glycaemic control insulin detemir was often injected twice-daily in a higher dose but with less weight gain, while insulin glargine was only injected once-daily, with somewhat fewer injection site reactions.",1008,insulin glargine; insulin detemir; type 2 diabetes mellitus; glycaemic control; hypoglycaemia; glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c); injection site reactions; fasting plasma glucose (FPG); insulin treatment regimens; health-related quality of life,How did the different dosing schedules of insulin detemir and insulin glargine contribute to the overall findings of the study?,How does the study's conclusion on the efficacy equivalence of insulin detemir and insulin glargine impact future research directions?,Select all of the following that are colors,To what extent do the findings on injection site reactions influence the comparative safety evaluation of insulin detemir and insulin glargine?,Summarize the finding related to weight gain between the two insulin treatments.,The dosing differences were irrelevant to the glycaemic control outcomes.; Insulin detemir required more frequent injections but resulted in less weight gain.; Insulin glargine's once-daily dosing led to a higher risk of injection site reactions.,Insulin detemir required more frequent injections but resulted in less weight gain.,It suggests that research should focus on personalized treatment plans based on patient preference.; It indicates the need for more studies comparing these insulins with newer analogues.; It eliminates the necessity for any further comparative studies on these two insulins.,It suggests that research should focus on personalized treatment plans based on patient preference.; It indicates the need for more studies comparing these insulins with newer analogues.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,The lower rate of reactions with insulin glargine suggests it may be preferable for patients concerned about injection discomfort.; The similarity in injection site reactions indicates there is no safety difference.; The difference in injection site reactions is statistically but not clinically significant.,The lower rate of reactions with insulin glargine suggests it may be preferable for patients concerned about injection discomfort.,Insulin detemir was associated with significantly less weight gain.; Insulin glargine resulted in more weight gain.; Both insulins caused the same amount of weight gain.,Insulin detemir was associated with significantly less weight gain.

The aim of this review was to assess the effects of conservative (non-surgical) interventions for treating hyperextension injuries of the PIP joints. We searched multiple databases and trial registers up to early 2012. Randomised and quasi-randomised studies comparing immobilisation, protected mobilisation, or unrestricted mobilisation in people with non-surgically managed PIP hyperextension injuries were eligible. Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data, but no pooling was possible. Three trials with 366 participants were identified; all were over 15 years old and had methodological weaknesses with unclear or high risk of bias. None reported self-assessed function. One trial compared unrestricted mobility with immobilisation, one compared protected mobilisation with immobilisation, and one compared immobilisation for one week versus three weeks. None found statistically significant differences between groups in poor outcomes, pain, or range of movement at six months, and for the unrestricted-mobility versus immobilisation comparison, no differences were found even at three years. Overall, evidence from trials is insufficient to guide decisions on whether immobilisation is needed, and if so, for how long or to what extent, when treating PIP hyperextension injuries.","Injury to the ligaments of the middle joint (proximal interphalangeal joint) of a finger may occur as a result of the finger being forced backwards. This is known as a hyperextension injury. Characteristically, this occurs in sporting accidents, such as where a football strikes an outstretched hand. These injuries are common and typically affect people of working age. Usually, these patients are treated without surgery using a combination of support (splinting/strapping to the adjacent finger) and exercise advice. Use of the hand is commonly encouraged but restricted to some degree by the severity of the injury. By examining the evidence from randomised controlled trials, this review aimed to assess which treatment for hyperextension injuries of the proximal interphalangeal joints of the fingers results in the best outcome for patients. The outcomes examined included function (including return to work), pain and joint movement.
Three small studies including a total of 366 patients met the inclusion criteria for the review. The studies, which were all over 15 years old, were prone to bias. None of the studies reported any self assessment of function by participants. One study compared unrestricted mobility with immobilisation. One trial compared protected mobilisation (using a removable support in combination with exercise) with immobilisation. The remaining study compared immobilisation for one week versus three weeks. None of these trials found important differences between their intervention groups in various measures of poor outcome, pain and range of movement at six months follow-up.
We concluded that there was a lack of robust evidence to inform on the need for, and the extent and duration of, immobilisation for these injuries.",1055,immobilisation; hyperextension injuries; proximal interphalangeal joint; conservative interventions; protected mobilisation; unrestricted mobilisation; self-assessed function; range of movement; unrestricted mobility,What types of injuries are hyperextension injuries of the proximal interphalangeal joint?,What was the motivation behind the review?,Select all of the following that are colors,Which methods of conservative treatment were compared in the studies?,Summarize the results reported regarding differences in outcomes between intervention groups.,Ligament injuries from finger hyperextension; Fractures to the fingertip; Tendon injuries from bending,Ligament injuries from finger hyperextension,To find the best non-surgical treatment for finger hyperextension injuries; To promote surgical interventions for all finger injuries; To explore all possible injuries to the hand,To find the best non-surgical treatment for finger hyperextension injuries,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Unrestricted mobility vs. immobilisation; Only surgery vs. non-surgery; Protected mobilisation vs. medication,Unrestricted mobility vs. immobilisation,No important differences found; Significant outcomes in terms of recovery; Minor differences but not statistically significant,No important differences found; Minor differences but not statistically significant
568899d9d7848e0005399c6b,finetuned_6,Treatments to reduce body temperature to 35C in people who are in hospital after a traumatic brain injury,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and disability, with an estimated 5.5 million people experiencing severe TBI worldwide every year. Observational clinical studies suggest a link between raised body temperature and unfavourable outcomes, though findings are inconsistent. Preclinical models indicate that reducing temperature to 35C to 37.5C may improve biological outcomes compared to deeper cooling (33C). It remains unknown whether reducing body temperature to 35C in people admitted to hospital with TBI is beneficial, neutral, or harmful. This review updates a previous version published in 2014. We aimed to assess the effects of pharmacological or physical interventions designed to reduce body temperature to 35C in adults and children hospitalised after TBI. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, PubMed, clinical trial registers, grey literature, reference lists, and forward citations up to 28 November 2019. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving participants of any age admitted after TBI and receiving interventions intended to lower body temperature within the target range, including medications (paracetamol, NSAIDs) or physical cooling methods (surface cooling devices, bedside fans, cooled intravenous fluids). Eligible comparators were placebo or usual care. Two authors independently assessed studies, extracted data, and evaluated risk of bias, using GRADE to assess certainty of evidence. Only one RCT with 41 adult participants, conducted in two Australian intensive care units, met the criteria. Participants received intravenous paracetamol (1 g every four hours for 72 hours) or a matched placebo. We were uncertain whether paracetamol influenced 28-day mortality (risk ratio 2.86, 95% CI 0.32 to 25.24). The certainty of evidence was very low due to imprecision (small sample size) and selective reporting concerns, although other risks of bias were low. The study did not report the primary outcome of poor outcome at follow-up (death or dependency) or any secondary outcomes of interest, including intracranial or extracranial haemorrhage, abnormal intracranial pressure, or pneumonia or other serious infections. We found one additional completed trial of a physical intervention (advanced fever control using a surface cooling device versus standard fever control in 12 participants), but it was published only as an abstract with insufficient details for inclusion; it is listed as awaiting classification pending further information. Four ongoing trials may contribute data to future updates if they report relevant outcomes and provide separate results for participants with TBI when mixed populations are included. In conclusion, one small study contributed very low-certainty evidence on mortality. Overall uncertainty is driven by extremely limited research on interventions aimed at reducing body temperature to 35C after TBI. More research evaluating both pharmacological and physical interventions is needed. Future studies should include outcomes important to patients, such as side effects (e.g., nausea, vomiting) and discomfort caused by cooling therapies.","Traumatic brain injury occurs when direct force to the headsuch as from a road traffic accident or a fall causes damage to the brain. It is a major global health problem, affecting about 5.5 million people each year. Injury occurs in two stages: first at the moment of impact, and then over the following hours to weeks as secondary damage develops. Treatment aims to limit this secondary damage. Some evidence suggests that people with normal body temperature after injury may have better outcomes than those with elevated temperatures. This review examined whether medicines or non-drug physical cooling methods that reduce body temperature to between 35C improve outcomes for adults or children hospitalized after traumatic brain injury. We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs)the most reliable type of evidence up to 28 November 2019. Only one small RCT with 41 participants was found. It compared intravenous paracetamol, given for 72 hours, with an intravenous salt solution made to look identical. No published trials assessed other medicines or physical cooling methods such as cooling blankets, ice, fans, or cooled fluids. One very small study of physical cooling was identified but lacked enough information for inclusion, and four ongoing studies may provide future evidence. Some of these include mixed types of brain injury, and we will only be able to use them if they report traumatic brain injury results separately. We were uncertain whether paracetamol reduced deaths within 28 days because the study was very small and did not originally plan to report mortality. It also did not report any of our key outcomes, such as poor functional outcome (death or dependency), serious bleeding inside or outside the brain, raised intracranial pressure, pneumonia, or other infections. Although the study methods were generally sound, the lack of pre-specified reporting increased the risk of bias. With only one small study, the certainty of the evidence was very low, meaning the true effects may be very different from what was reported. Overall, we remain uncertain whether medicines or physical cooling treatments that lower body temperature to 35C benefit people in hospital after traumatic brain injury. More and larger studies are needed, and future updates will assess side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and discomfort, which we hope ongoing and future research will report.",1056,Traumatic brain injury; pharmacological interventions; physical cooling methods; certainty of evidence; imprecision; intracranial pressure; extracranial haemorrhage; pneumonia; advanced fever control,What were the motivations for the study's focus on cooling treatments for TBI?,Which factors contributed to the uncertainty of the study results on paracetamol?,Select all of the following that are colors,"Based on the study, what can be concluded about the use of cooling methods in reducing TBI mortality rates?",Explain the main goal of the study in your own words.,Elevated body temperatures suggest potentially worse outcomes for TBI patients.; Normal body temperature is universally accepted to improve brain injury outcomes.; Cooling treatments have been consistently proven in other unrelated medical contexts.,Elevated body temperatures suggest potentially worse outcomes for TBI patients.,The study used a too short duration of treatment.; The small sample size and lack of pre-planned mortality reporting.; The study confirmed that all key outcomes were reported comprehensively.,The small sample size and lack of pre-planned mortality reporting.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,The study provides strong evidence that cooling methods reduce mortality.; Cooling methods' impact on mortality is uncertain due to the study's limited scope.; Mortality rates increase significantly with the use of cooling methods.,Cooling methods' impact on mortality is uncertain due to the study's limited scope.,To determine if cooling to 35-37.5Â°C improves outcomes after TBI; To establish the best surgical intervention for TBI; To identify genetic markers of TBI,To determine if cooling to 35-37.5Â°C improves outcomes after TBI
5758a78d768081000631a322,static_1,Revascularisation of the left subclavian artery for thoracic endovascular aortic repair,"Controversy exists as to whether revascularisation of the left subclavian artery (LSA) confers improved outcomes in patients undergoing thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR). Even though preemptive revascularisation of the LSA has theoretical advantages, including a reduced risk of ischaemic damage to vital organs, such as the brain and the spinal cord, it is not without risks. Current practice guidelines recommend routine revascularisation of the LSA in patients undergoing elective TEVAR where achievement of a proximal seal necessitates coverage of the LSA, and in patients who have an anatomy that compromises perfusion to critical organs. However, this recommendation was based on very low-quality evidence. To assess the comparative efficacy of routine LSA revascularisation versus either selective or no revascularisation in patients with descending thoracic aortic disease undergoing TEVAR with coverage of the LSA origin. The Cochrane Vascular Trials Search Co-ordinator (TSC) searched the Specialised Register (June 2015). In addition, the TSC searched the Cochrane Register of Studies (CENTRAL (2015, Issue 5)).Trials databases were also searched (June 2015). We had planned to consider all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared routine revascularisation of the LSA with selective or no revascularisation, in patients undergoing TEVAR. Two review authors independently assessed the title and abstract of articles identified through literature searches. An independent third review author was consulted in the event of disagreement. We had planned for two review authors to independently extract data and assess the risk of bias of identified trials using the criteria recommended in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We did not identify any RCTs relevant to our review topic. Therefore, no quantitative analysis was conducted. High quality RCT evidence for or against routine or selective revascularisation of the LSA in TEVAR is not currently available. It is not possible to draw conclusions with regard to the optimal management of LSA coverage in TEVAR, and whether routine revascularisation, which was defined as the intervention of interest in our review, confers beneficial effects, as indicated by reduced mortality, cerebrovascular events, and spinal cord ischaemia. This review highlights the need for continued research to provide RCT evidence and define the role of LSA revascularisation in the context of TEVAR with coverage of the LSA.","The thoracic aorta is the largest blood vessel in the chest. It originates from the heart and supplies blood to the whole body. It can be affected by several diseases, including an aneurysm, which is an enlargement of a weakened section of the aorta, and dissection, which occurs when a tear in the aortic lining causes blood to flow between the layers of the wall of the aorta, forcing the layers apart. The traditional treatment of these conditions is open surgical repair. Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) has evolved as an alternative treatment for a wide variety of aortic diseases. It is less invasive than open surgery, and involves inserting an artificial graft (a tube composed of fabric) into the thoracic aorta through an artery in the groin (the femoral artery), to help reinforce the aortic wall. A significant proportion of patients with thoracic aortic disease have abnormalities close to, or involving the origin of the left subclavian artery (LSA; one of the branches of the thoracic aorta). In these situations, the aortic stent graft needs to be placed close to the LSA, thereby blocking the blood vessel opening. This can potentially result in reduced blood supply to the brain and spinal cord, causing stroke and spinal cord ischaemia (spinal cord stroke). This review aimed to look at the value of a surgical bypass, which can provide an alternative route for blood supply (revascularisation) to the brain and spinal cord in cases of TEVAR, where the LSA is covered. Controversy exists as to whether routine revascularisation of the LSA, with a surgical bypass, results in improved outcomes in patients undergoing TEVAR, as measured by a reduced risk of stroke and paraplegia (paralysis of the legs). Even though preemptive LSA revascularisation has theoretical advantages, it is not without risks, including nerve damage, bleeding, and graft infection. The Society for Vascular Surgery Practice Guidelines recommend routine revascularisation of the LSA in non-emergency TEVAR, where the LSA origin is covered. However, this recommendation was based on very low-quality evidence. We undertook a comprehensive, systematic search of the pertinent literature to identify the best available evidence and had planned to synthesise outcome data from randomised controlled trials (RCTs), in order to assist clinicians and patients to make evidence-based decisions. We did not identify any RCTs investigating our study question (evidence current until June 2015). The best available evidence comes from non-randomised comparative studies. There is a need for high quality RCTs providing more robust evidence.

5758a78d768081000631a322,static_2,Is liraglutide an effective weight-loss treatment for adults living with obesity and does it cause unwanted effects?,"To assess the effects of liraglutide, a GLP-1RA, for adults living with obesity, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and two trials registries on 17 December 2024. Liraglutide likely increases the proportion of people achieving at least 5% weight loss at medium-term follow-up; this effect is likely to be sustained at longer-term follow-up. Medium- or long-term impact on percentage weight change, MACE, quality of life, and mortality may be limited or uncertain. Liraglutide may lead to an increase in adverse events, including serious adverse events in both the medium and long term, which might further limit the sustainability of the initial effects. The drug manufacturer funded 22 studies, raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest. Further independent and long-term studies are needed to better understand the broader effects of liraglutide in the management of obesity.","Obesity is a long-term condition in which a person has too much body fat. It can increase the risk of health problems like type 2 diabetes, diseases of the heart and blood vessels (cardiovascular disease), and some types of cancer. Obesity levels are increasing worldwide, placing a significant burden on healthcare systems. Managing obesity usually involves lifestyle changes such as eating a healthier diet and being more physically active. However, many people find these changes difficult to maintain, and doctors may prescribe medications to support weight loss. Liraglutide is a type of medication that helps people feel full sooner, and so eat less. It was originally developed to treat type 2 diabetes but has been approved in many countries to help people lose weight. It is given as a daily injection. Some people taking liraglutide experience unwanted effects, such as feeling or being sick, diarrhoea and constipation. Liraglutide is a  GLP-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA). Similar medications include semaglutide and tirzepatide. We wanted to know how well liraglutide works in adults with obesity in the medium term (6 to 24 months) and long term (24 months or more). We examined its effects on weight, unwanted effects, obesity-related health problems, quality of life and risk of death. We did not look at what happens after people stop taking liraglutide. We searched for studies that investigated liraglutide for adults living with obesity. Studies could investigate any dose of liraglutide compared with placebo (sham medication), no treatment, lifestyle changes or another weight-loss medication. We included studies in which people took liraglutide for at least 6 months. We compared and analysed the results and assessed our confidence in the evidence. We found 24 studies with 9937 men and women with obesity, aged between 31 and 64 years. Some people had weight-related conditions like diabetes or liver disease. Most studies compared liraglutide with placebo. They mainly took place in high- and middle-income countries. People who took liraglutide were more likely to lose at least 5% of their body weight than those who took a placebo in the medium (18 studies, 6651 people) and long term (2 studies, 1262 people). However, we are uncertain about liraglutide's effects on people's overall percentage weight change from the beginning of the study to the medium term (16 studies, 6050 people) and there may be little to no difference in percentage weight change in the long term (2 studies, 1262 people). In the medium term, people taking liraglutide might experience more unwanted effects of any kind (16 studies, 8147 people) and more serious unwanted effects (20 studies, 8487 people) than those taking placebo. We are unsure about mild-to-moderate unwanted effects (17 studies, 7440 people) or whether unwanted effects caused people to stop treatment (19 studies, 8628 people). In the long term (2 studies, 2640 participants), liraglutide may increase unwanted effects and people may be more likely to stop treatment because of them. We are unsure about unwanted events overall and mild-to-moderate unwanted effects. Liraglutide probably makes little or no difference to quality of life both in the medium term (6 studies, 3733 people) and in the long term (1 study, 863 people). Liraglutide probably makes little or no difference to major cardiovascular events in the medium term (6 studies, 5762 people). We are unsure about its effects on major cardiovascular events in the long term and on deaths in the medium and long term. We are moderately confident that people taking liraglutide lose more weight than those taking placebo. However, our confidence in the other evidence is limited because of how the studies were conducted and information that was missing. Few studies looked at long-term effects or included different people from different places, so the results may not apply to everyone. The manufacturers of liraglutide were involved in the design, conduct or analysis of 22 of the 24 studies, which limits our confidence in the results.

5758a78d768081000631a322,static_2,Does treatment with GLP-1 receptor agonists prevent complications for people with chronic kidney disease and diabetes?,"Approximately 40% of people with diabetes develop kidney failure and experience an accelerated risk of cardiovascular complications. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are glucose-lowering agents that manage glucose and weight control.
We assessed the benefits and harms of GLP-1 receptor agonists in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes.
The Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies was searched to 10 September 2024 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.
Randomised controlled studies were eligible if participants with diabetes and CKD were randomly allocated to a GLP-1 receptor agonist, placebo, standard care or a second glucose-lowering agent. CKD included all stages (from 1 to 5).
Three authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias using the risk of bias assessment tool 2. Pooled analyses using summary estimates of effects were obtained using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and/or hazard ratio (HR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. The primary outcomes included death (all-cause and cardiovascular), 3- and 4-point major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), kidney failure, composite kidney outcome, and severe hypoglycaemia. The secondary outcomes included non-fatal or fatal myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke, non-fatal peripheral arterial events, heart failure, hospitalisation due to heart failure, estimated glomerular filtration rate or creatinine clearance, doubling of serum creatinine, urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio, albuminuria progression, vascular access outcomes, body weight, body mass index, fatigue, life participation, peritoneal dialysis infection, peritoneal dialysis failure, adverse events, serious adverse events, withdrawal due to adverse events, HbA1c, sudden death, acute MI, ischaemic stroke, and coronary revascularisation. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.
Forty-two studies involving 48,148 participants were included. All studies were conducted on people with type 2 diabetes, and no studies were carried out on children. The median study age was 66 years. The median study follow-up was 26 weeks. Six studies were conducted in people with CKD stages 1-2, 11 studies in people with CKD stages 3-5, one study in people on dialysis, and the remaining studies included people with both CKD stages 1-2 and 3-5. Risks of bias in the included studies for all the primary outcomes in studies that compared GLP-1 receptor agonists to placebo were low in most methodological domains, except one study that was assessed at high risk of bias due to missing outcome data for death (all-cause and cardiovascular). The overall risk of bias for all-cause and cardiovascular death in studies that reported the treatment effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists compared to standard care, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors or sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors were assessed as unclear or at high risk of bias due to deviations from intended interventions or missing data. For GLP-1 receptor agonists compared to insulin or another GLP-1 receptor agonist, the risk of bias for all-cause and cardiovascular death was low or unclear. Compared to placebo, GLP-1 receptor agonists probably reduced the risk of all-cause death (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.98; I²= 23%; 8 studies, 17,861 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), but may have little or no effect on cardiovascular death (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.05; I²= 42%; 7 studies, 17,801 participants; low-certainty evidence). Compared to placebo, GLP-1 receptor agonists probably decreased 3-point MACE (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.98; I² = 65%; 4 studies, 19,825 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and 4-point MACE compared to placebo (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.89; 1 study, 2,158 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Based on absolute risks of clinical outcomes, it is likely that GLP-1 receptor agonists prevent all-cause death in 52 people with CKD stages 1-2 and 116 in CKD stages 3-5, cardiovascular death in 34 people with CKD stages 1-2 and 71 in CKD stages 3-5, while 95 CKD stages 1-2 and 153 in CKD stages 3-5 might experience a major cardiovascular event for every 1000 people treated over 1 year. Compared to placebo, GLP-1 receptor agonists probably had little or no effect on kidney failure, defined as starting dialysis or kidney transplant (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.13; I²= 0%; 3 studies, 4,134 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), or on composite kidney outcomes (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.02; I²= 0%; 2 studies, 16,849 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Compared to placebo, GLP-1 receptor agonists may have little or no effect on the risk of severe hypoglycaemia (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.25; I² = 44%; 4 studies, 6,292 participants; low-certainty evidence). The effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists compared to standard care or other hypoglycaemic agents were uncertain. No studies evaluated treatment on risks of fatigue, life participation, amputation or fracture.
GLP-1 receptor agonists probably reduced all-cause death but may have little or no effect on cardiovascular death in people with CKD and diabetes. GLP-1 receptor agonists probably lower major cardiovascular events, probably have little or no effect on kidney failure and composite kidney outcomes, and may have little or no effect on the risk of severe hypoglycaemia in people with CKD and diabetes.","Chronic kidney disease (CKD) (a long-term condition where the kidneys do not work effectively) and diabetes (a lifelong condition that causes a person's blood sugar level to become too high) are chronic conditions that bring on many challenges for people, particularly when they have to manage both at the same time. Diabetes can accelerate the development of kidney disease and is the leading cause of kidney failure (a condition where the kidneys no longer function well enough to keep a person alive). GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1) are medicines that lower blood glucose levels and may also have beneficial effects on high blood pressure and obesity, and decrease the chances of death, heart attack, stroke and kidney failure (a condition where the kidneys no longer function well enough to keep a person alive).
We wanted to find out if GLP-1 improves diabetes control and kidney function, decreases heart-related complications such as heart attacks and stroke, and decreases the risk of kidney failure in people with both CKD and diabetes.
We searched for all trials that assessed the benefits and harms of GLP-1 for treating people with both CKD and diabetes. We compared GLP-1 with placebo (dummy medicine), usual care, and other glucose-lowering medicines (for example, insulin).
We included 42 studies that randomised 48,148 adults (18 years or older) with CKD and diabetes. None of the studies included children. The number of people ranged from 7 to 14,691, and the age ranged from 51 to 71 years. On average, the duration of the studies was six months. Twenty-one studies compared GLP-1 to placebo, 16 compared GLP-1 to a variety of glucose-lowering medicines, and five compared GLP-1 to standard care. Twenty-eight studies were multinational.
Compared to placebo, GLP-1 probably reduces the overall risk of dying due to any cause but may have little or no effect on the chances of dying from a heart-related problem. When major heart-related events were investigated together (death due to a heart attack, nonfatal heart attack and nonfatal stroke), GLP-1 probably reduces the risk of these combined events occurring. GLP-1 probably makes little or no difference to kidney failure and may make little or no difference to abnormally low blood glucose levels.
The effect of GLP-1 compared to usual care and other glucose-lowering medicines is unclear.
We are moderately confident that GLP-1 reduces the risk of dying due to any cause, reduces major heart-related events, and makes little or no difference to kidney failure. We are less confident in its effect on death from a heart-related problem or abnormally low blood sugar levels.

5758a78d768081000631a322,interactive_3,Mediterranean-style diet for the prevention of cardiovascular disease,"The Seven Countries study in the 1960s showed that populations in the Mediterranean region experienced lower coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality probably as a result of different dietary patterns. Later observational studies have confirmed the benefits of adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors but clinical trial evidence is more limited.
To determine the effectiveness of a Mediterranean-style diet for the primary and secondary prevention of CVD.
We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 9); MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 25 September 2018); Embase (Ovid, 1980 to 2018 week 39); Web of Science Core Collection (Thomson Reuters, 1900 to 26 September 2018); DARE Issue 2 of 4, 2015 (Cochrane Library); HTA Issue 4 of 4, 2016 (Cochrane Library); NHS EED Issue 2 of 4, 2015 (Cochrane Library). We searched trial registers and applied no language restrictions.
We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in healthy adults and adults at high risk of CVD (primary prevention) and those with established CVD (secondary prevention). Both of the following key components were required to reach our definition of a Mediterranean-style diet: high monounsaturated/saturated fat ratio (use of olive oil as main cooking ingredient and/or consumption of other traditional foods high in monounsaturated fats such as tree nuts) and a high intake of plant-based foods, including fruits, vegetables and legumes. Additional components included: low to moderate red wine consumption; high consumption of whole grains and cereals; low consumption of meat and meat products and increased consumption of fish; moderate consumption of milk and dairy products. The intervention could be dietary advice, provision of relevant foods, or both. The comparison group received either no intervention, minimal intervention, usual care or another dietary intervention. Outcomes included clinical events and CVD risk factors. We included only studies with follow-up periods of three months or more defined as the intervention period plus post intervention follow-up.
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We conducted four main comparisons: 1. Mediterranean dietary intervention versus no intervention or minimal intervention for primary prevention; 2. Mediterranean dietary intervention versus another dietary intervention for primary prevention; 3. Mediterranean dietary intervention versus usual care for secondary prevention; 4. Mediterranean dietary intervention versus another dietary intervention for secondary prevention.
In this substantive review update, 30 RCTs (49 papers) (12,461 participants randomised) and seven ongoing trials met our inclusion criteria. The majority of trials contributed to primary prevention: comparisons 1 (nine trials) and 2 (13 trials). Secondary prevention trials were included for comparison 3 (two trials) and comparison 4 (four trials plus an additional two trials that were excluded from the main analyses due to published concerns regarding the reliability of the data). Two trials reported on adverse events where these were absent or minor (low- to moderate-quality evidence). No trials reported on costs or health-related quality of life. Primary prevention The included studies for comparison 1 did not report on clinical endpoints (CVD mortality, total mortality or non-fatal endpoints such as myocardial infarction or stroke). The PREDIMED trial (included in comparison 2) was retracted and re-analysed following concerns regarding randomisation at two of 11 sites. Low-quality evidence shows little or no effect of the PREDIMED (7747 randomised) intervention (advice to follow a Mediterranean diet plus supplemental extra-virgin olive oil or tree nuts) compared to a low-fat diet on CVD mortality (hazard ratio (HR) 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50 to 1.32) or total mortality (HR 1.0, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.24) over 4.8 years. There was, however, a reduction in the number of strokes with the PREDIMED intervention (HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.80), a decrease from 24/1000 to 14/1000 (95% CI 11 to 19), moderate-quality evidence). For CVD risk factors for comparison 1 there was low-quality evidence for a possible small reduction in total cholesterol (-0.16 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.32 to 0.00) and moderate-quality evidence for a reduction in systolic (-2.99 mmHg (95% CI -3.45 to -2.53) and diastolic blood pressure (-2.0 mmHg, 95% CI -2.29 to -1.71), with low or very low-quality evidence of little or no effect on LDL or HDL cholesterol or triglycerides. For comparison 2 there was moderate-quality evidence of a possible small reduction in LDL cholesterol (-0.15 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.27 to -0.02) and triglycerides (-0.09 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.16 to -0.01) with moderate or low-quality evidence of little or no effect on total or HDL cholesterol or blood pressure. Secondary prevention For secondary prevention, the Lyon Diet Heart Study (comparison 3) examined the effect of advice to follow a Mediterranean diet and supplemental canola margarine compared to usual care in 605 CHD patients over 46 months and there was low-quality evidence of a reduction in adjusted estimates for CVD mortality (HR 0.35, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.82) and total mortality (HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.92) with the intervention. Only one small trial (101 participants) provided unadjusted estimates for composite clinical endpoints for comparison 4 (very low-quality evidence of uncertain effect). For comparison 3 there was low-quality evidence of little or no effect of a Mediterranean-style diet on lipid levels and very low-quality evidence for blood pressure. Similarly, for comparison 4 where only two trials contributed to the analyses there was low or very low-quality evidence of little or no effect of the intervention on lipid levels or blood pressure.
Despite the relatively large number of studies included in this review, there is still some uncertainty regarding the effects of a Mediterranean-style diet on clinical endpoints and CVD risk factors for both primary and secondary prevention. The quality of evidence for the modest benefits on CVD risk factors in primary prevention is low or moderate, with a small number of studies reporting minimal harms. There is a paucity of evidence for secondary prevention. The ongoing studies may provide more certainty in the future.","It is well established that diet plays a major role in cardiovascular disease risk. The traditional Mediterranean dietary pattern is of particular interest because of observations from the 1960s that populations in countries of the Mediterranean region, such as Greece and Italy, had lower mortality from cardiovascular disease compared with northern European populations or the US, probably as a result of different eating habits.
This review assessed the effects of providing dietary advice to follow a Mediterranean-style diet or provision of foods relevant to the diet (or both) to healthy adults, people at increased risk of cardiovascular disease and those with cardiovascular disease, in order to prevent the occurrence or recurrence of cardiovascular disease and reduce the risk factors associated with it. Definitions of a Mediterranean dietary pattern vary and we included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions that reported both of the following key components: a high monounsaturated/saturated fat ratio (use of olive oil as main cooking ingredient and/or consumption of other traditional foods high in monounsaturated fats such as tree nuts) and a high intake of plant-based foods, including fruits, vegetables and legumes. Additional components included: low to moderate red wine consumption; high consumption of whole grains and cereals; low consumption of meat and meat products and increased consumption of fish; moderate consumption of milk and dairy products. The control group was no intervention or minimal intervention, usual care or another dietary intervention. We found 30 RCTs (49 papers) that met these criteria. The trials varied enormously in the participants recruited and the different dietary interventions. We grouped studies to look at the effects of following a Mediterranean-style diet into the following four categories to help us with our interpretation of the results:
1. Mediterranean dietary intervention compared to no intervention or a minimal intervention to prevent the onset of cardiovascular disease;
2. Mediterranean dietary intervention compared to another dietary intervention to prevent the onset of cardiovascular disease;
3. Mediterranean dietary intervention compared to usual care for people with cardiovascular disease to prevent recurrence;
4. Mediterranean dietary intervention compared to another dietary intervention for people with cardiovascular disease to prevent recurrence.
Few trials reported on the occurrence of cardiovascular disease either in those with or without disease to begin with. A large trial in people at high risk of cardiovascular disease found a benefit of the Mediterranean dietary intervention compared to a low-fat diet on the risk of having a stroke, but not on heart attacks, death from heart disease or other causes. A further study in people with cardiovascular disease found a benefit of the Mediterranean dietary intervention on death from heart disease or other causes. We rated these two studies as providing low to moderate-quality evidence. We had to exclude two studies from our analyses as concerns had been raised that the data were unreliable. The other trials in the review measured risk factors for cardiovascular disease. There was low to moderate-quality evidence for some beneficial changes in lipid levels and blood pressure with a Mediterranean-style diet in people without disease. In people with cardiovascular disease already there was very low to low-quality evidence that there was no effect of a Mediterranean-style diet on risk factors. Two trials reported side effects of the diet that were either absent or minor.
The review concludes that, despite the large number of included trials, there is still uncertainty regarding the effects of a Mediterranean-style diet on cardiovascular disease occurrence and risk factors in people both with and without cardiovascular disease already. We did find seven studies that are still ongoing and when we have the results from these we will incorporate them into the review to help reduce the uncertainty.",1047,Mediterranean dietary pattern; cardiovascular disease; primary prevention; secondary prevention; monounsaturated fats; PREDIMED trial; CVD mortality; Lyon Diet Heart Study; systolic blood pressure; diastolic blood pressure,Which of the following can be deduced about the benefits of a Mediterranean-style diet based on the trials included in the review?,How might one evaluate the reliability of the evidence regarding the Mediterranean diet's effect on CVD occurrence?,Select all of the following that are colors,What conclusions can be drawn about the role of the Mediterranean diet specifically in stroke prevention?,What was the primary focus of the study?,It provides definitive protection against all cardiovascular events.; It has modest benefits on certain risk factors for cardiovascular disease.; It significantly reduces the occurrence of cardiovascular disease in all demographics.,It has modest benefits on certain risk factors for cardiovascular disease.,By considering the number of participants involved in the trials.; By assessing the consistency of outcomes across different studies.; By reviewing the dietary components included in each trial.,By considering the number of participants involved in the trials.; By assessing the consistency of outcomes across different studies.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,"The Mediterranean diet shows potential benefits in reducing stroke risk according to low to moderate-quality evidence.; There is strong, high-quality evidence supporting the Mediterranean diet as a primary prevention method for strokes.; The evidence is insufficient to draw any conclusions about stroke prevention.",The Mediterranean diet shows potential benefits in reducing stroke risk according to low to moderate-quality evidence.,Effects of pharmaceuticals on cardiovascular disease; Effects of a Mediterranean-style diet on cardiovascular disease; Effects of exercise on cardiovascular disease,Effects of a Mediterranean-style diet on cardiovascular disease
5758a78d768081000631a322,interactive_4,Fixed-dose combination drug therapy for the prevention of heart disease and stroke,"Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) remains the leading cause of death and disability worldwide, yet many people still do not receive adequate treatment to control their risk factors. One strategy proposed to help address this gap is the use of a fixed-dose combination pill often called a polypill that combines blood pressure-lowering drugs, cholesterol-lowering medication, and sometimes antiplatelet therapy into a single tablet taken daily. This review evaluated whether such fixed-dose combination therapy leads to fewer deaths, fewer heart attacks and strokes, improved adherence to medication, and better control of cardiovascular risk factors compared with usual care, placebo, or taking medications separately. We included 13 randomised controlled trials involving a total of 9059 adults; four of these trials were new additions in this update. Most studies involved people without established ASCVD, and follow-up ranged from six weeks to nearly two years. Participants were generally in their early 60s, and about one-third were women. Newer studies tended to be larger, longer, and had a lower risk of bias. However, a major limitation across all trials was the inability to blind participants or researchers to the treatment since the fixed-dose pill differs visibly from usual care, which could influence reported outcomes. Overall, the effects of fixed-dose combination therapy on important clinical outcomes, such as death or major cardiovascular events, remain uncertain. About 1% of participants in both the fixed-dose and control groups died during the trials, showing no clear difference (risk ratio 1.10, 95% confidence interval 0.64 to 1.89). Similarly, the proportion of people who experienced a heart attack or stroke was small (4.7% in the fixed-dose group versus 3.7% in the control group), and the evidence did not show a clear effect (risk ratio 1.26, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.66). These findings are limited by the low number of events and the fact that most trials focused on risk factor changes rather than long-term outcomes. Side effects occurred commonly in both groups, but people taking the fixed-dose pill were somewhat more likely to report an adverse event (32% versus 27%), meaning a 16% increased risk. This is not unexpected since the polypill combines several medications known to cause side effects individually. Despite this, the fixed-dose combination showed consistent improvements in risk factor control. On average, systolic blood pressure was lowered by about 6 mmHg compared with usual care, and LDL cholesterol dropped by approximately 0.70 mmol/L. Total cholesterol also decreased modestly. However, these results showed substantial statistical variation between trials, so they should be interpreted cautiously. A key advantage of fixed-dose combination therapy was improved medication adherence. Across four studies, adherence to treatment was 44% higher among participants taking the polypill than among those receiving usual care. This suggests that simplifying treatment into a single pill may help more people take their medications consistently. In summary, while fixed-dose combination therapy improves blood pressure, cholesterol, and adherence, current evidence is insufficient to determine whether it reduces heart attacks, strokes, or deaths. Most trials were not designed or powered to assess these major outcomes, which likely explains the lack of clear effects. Fixed-dose therapy does appear to increase minor side effects but may help patients stay on treatment better. Ongoing and longer-term studies will be critical to determine whether the improvements in risk factors observed with polypill therapy eventually translate into meaningful reductions in cardiovascular events.","We examined the evidence on whether using fixed-dose combination drug therapy can help prevent heart attacks and strokes. This approach combines several medications typically drugs that lower blood pressure and cholesterol into a single pill. We identified 13 studies involving 9059 adults. The evidence is current up to September 2016. Researchers wanted to know if taking multiple preventive medications in a single pill was better or worse than usual care, placebo, or taking each drug separately. This updated review includes studies published since the previous Cochrane Review from 2014. Four of the included studies involved people who already had a previous heart attack or stroke, or who were at high risk of having one. Five studies followed participants for 12 months or longer. Most of the participants were middle-aged men with moderately high blood pressure or cholesterol levels, and two studies specifically included large numbers of Aboriginal or Maori participants. The fixed-dose pills in these trials contained between two and five medications, but all combinations included at least one drug to lower blood pressure and one to lower cholesterol. A major limitation across studies was that neither the participants nor the researchers could be blinded to the treatment, which could influence the results. The findings showed that it is still uncertain whether fixed-dose combination therapy reduces the risk of death, heart attacks, or strokes. Very few participants in the trials experienced these events less than 5% making it difficult to determine the true effect. The comparison with usual care also provided low-quality evidence, meaning confidence in these results is limited. Participants taking fixed-dose combination pills experienced more side effects compared with those in the control groups (32% versus 27%). This is expected because the medications involved such as aspirin, blood pressure-lowering drugs, and cholesterol-lowering drugsare known to cause side effects when taken individually. The combined pill may slightly reduce blood pressure by about 6 mmHg and lower LDL cholesterol by approximately 0.6 mmol/L, though these benefits were not seen consistently across all studies. Importantly, fixed-dose combination therapy did improve how regularly people took their preventive medications, suggesting better adherence overall. The overall quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to low, meaning that while some findings are fairly reliable, others remain uncertain. Ongoing and future clinical trials using fixed-dose combination therapy are expected to provide clearer evidence about its impact on major outcomes such as heart attacks, strokes, and deaths.",1048,Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; fixed-dose combination therapy; antiplatelet therapy; LDL cholesterol; systolic blood pressure; cardiovascular risk factors; placebo; cholesterol-lowering medication; blood pressure-lowering drugs; major cardiovascular events,How do the reported side effects of fixed-dose combination pills compare with usual care?,Which methodological limitations could affect the reliability of the studyÃ¢ÂÂs findings?,Select the items that are animals,"According to the findings, how did fixed-dose combination therapy affect medication adherence?",What effect did the fixed-dose combination pill have on blood pressure?,They are more frequent in the fixed-dose combination group.; They occur less frequently than in usual care.; The side effects are unrelated to the medications used.,They are more frequent in the fixed-dose combination group.,The inability to blind participants and researchers to treatment.; The inclusion of both men and women in the study.; The length of the follow-up period in some studies.,The inability to blind participants and researchers to treatment.; The length of the follow-up period in some studies.,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,It significantly improved adherence by simplifying treatment.; It reduced adherence due to increased side effects.; It had no impact on adherence as it was similar to usual care.,It significantly improved adherence by simplifying treatment.,It reduced systolic blood pressure by about 6 mmHg.; It increased systolic blood pressure by 5 mmHg.; It had no measurable impact on blood pressure.,It reduced systolic blood pressure by about 6 mmHg.
5758a78d768081000631a322,interactive_4,"What are the benefits and harms of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs), the next-generation blood thinners, after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR)?","Balancing the risk of thromboembolism and bleeding after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) remains clinically challenging. Questions regarding the efficacy and safety of  non?vitamin  K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) after TAVR still need to be definitively answered.
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of NOACs after TAVR in individuals with and without indication for anticoagulation.
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP on 7 October 2023 together with reference checking and citation searching to identify additional studies.
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared NOACs versus antiplatelet therapy or vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) after TAVR in adults with or without an indication for anticoagulation.
We used standard Cochrane methods and conducted random-effects pair-wise analyses and network meta-analyses (NMAs). Our primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, stroke, and major bleeding. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence.
We included four RCTs with 4808 participants in the NMA. Of these, one compared rivaroxaban versus antiplatelet therapy in people without an indication for anticoagulation after TAVR; one compared apixaban versus antiplatelet therapy in people without an indication for anticoagulation or versus VKA in people with an indication for anticoagulation after TAVR; one compared edoxaban versus VKA in people with an indication for anticoagulation after TAVR; and one compared edoxaban with antiplatelet therapy in people without an indication for anticoagulation after TAVR. The mean age of trial participants was 81 years. Follow-up duration ranged from 6 to 18 months. Overall, we judged the risk of bias in the included trials to be low in all domains except for blinding, which was assessed as high in all four studies. No studies evaluated dabigatran. In peoplewithoutan indication for anticoagulation, rivaroxaban and apixaban may increase all-cause mortality after TAVR as compared to antiplatelet therapy (rivaroxaban: risk ratio (RR) 1.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13 to 2.46; studies = 1, participants = 1644; moderate-certainty evidence; apixaban: RR 1.71, 95% CI 0.97 to 3.02; studies = 1, participants = 1049; low-certainty evidence), while edoxaban may result in little or no difference (RR 1.59, 95% CI 0.27 to 9.36; studies = 1, participants = 229; low-certainty evidence). Low-certainty evidence suggests little or no difference between rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban and antiplatelet therapy in cardiovascular mortality (rivaroxaban: RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.10; studies = 1, participants = 1644; apixaban: RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.64 to 2.65; studies = 1, participants = 1049; edoxaban: RR 7.44, 95% CI 0.39 to 142.38; studies = 1, participants = 229) and between rivaroxaban or edoxaban and antiplatelets in stroke (rivaroxaban: RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.71 to 2.00; studies = 1, participants = 1644; edoxaban: RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.15 to 7.42; studies = 1, participants = 229). While rivaroxaban versus antiplatelets probably increases major bleeding after TAVR (RR 1.98, 95% CI 1.07 to 3.65; studies = 1, participants = 1644; moderate-certainty evidence), there may be little or no difference between apixaban and antiplatelet therapy (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.64; studies = 1, participants = 1049; low-certainty evidence). It is unclear if edoxaban has an effect on major bleeding, although the point estimate suggests increased bleeding (versus antiplatelets: RR 2.13, 95% CI 0.54 to 8.30; studies = 1, participants = 229; low-certainty evidence). In peoplewithan indication for anticoagulation, low-certainty evidence suggests apixaban or edoxaban may result in little to no difference in our predefined primary efficacy outcomes after TAVR when compared to VKA (all-cause mortality: apixaban: RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.77; studies = 1, participants = 451; edoxaban: RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.20; studies = 1, participants = 1426; cardiovascular mortality: apixaban: RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.76 to 2.70; studies = 1, participants = 451; edoxaban: RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.57; studies = 1, participants = 1426; stroke: apixaban: RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.35 to 4.70; studies = 1, participants = 451; edoxaban: RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.34; studies = 1, participants = 1426). While apixaban may result in a similar rate of bleeding as VKA in this population, edoxaban probably increases major bleeding after TAVR in people with an indication for anticoagulation (apixaban: RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.54; studies = 1, participants = 451; low-certainty evidence; edoxaban: RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.93; studies = 1, participants = 1426; moderate-certainty evidence).
In peoplewithoutan indication for oral anticoagulation, rivaroxaban and apixaban may increase all-cause mortality when compared to antiplatelet therapy, while edoxaban may result in little or no difference. There might be little or no difference between rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban and antiplatelet therapy in cardiovascular mortality, and between rivaroxaban or edoxaban and antiplatelets in stroke. While rivaroxaban probably increases major bleeding following TAVR, there might be little or no difference between apixaban and antiplatelet therapy, and the effect of edoxaban on major bleeding remains unclear. In peoplewithan indication for anticoagulation, apixaban and edoxaban may be as effective as VKA in preventing all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death, and stroke. Apixaban may lead to a similar rate of major bleeding as VKA in this population. However, edoxaban probably increases major bleeding following TAVR when compared to VKA. Our NMA did not show superiority of one NOAC over another for any of the primary outcomes. Head-to-head trials directly comparing NOACs against each other are required to increase the certainty of the evidence.","TAVR is a heart valve replacement procedure that does not require open-heart surgery. It uses a heart catheter to insert a new valve through a small surgical incision in the leg or chest. Choosing the best treatment for people after TAVR remains a challenge in clinical practice.
We looked at whether the next-generation blood thinners, non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs), are safer and more effective than antiplatelet drugs or vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), such as warfarin, after TAVR.
We searched for studies that looked at the benefits and harms of NOACs compared with antiplatelet therapy or VKA after TAVR.
We found five studies that compared three types of NOACs: rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, with antiplatelet drugs or warfarin, one of which is ongoing. Our review findings are based on the four completed studies involving 4808 participants.
We found that in people who did not have a medical reason to take blood thinners, the NOACs rivaroxaban and apixaban may increase the risk of death for any reason compared to antiplatelet therapy, while edoxaban appears to have little or no effect. Any differences between rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban, and antiplatelet therapy in death caused by diseases of the heart or blood vessels are likely small. Similarly, differences between rivaroxaban or edoxaban and antiplatelets in stroke are also likely small. In these people, the risk of serious bleeding is probably increased with rivaroxaban; however, there seems to be little or no difference between apixaban and antiplatelet therapy, and we are uncertain about the impact of edoxaban on serious bleeding.
In people who have a medical reason to take blood thinners, we found that apixaban and edoxaban may be as effective as warfarin in preventing death for any reason, death caused by diseases of the heart or blood vessels, and stroke. Apixaban may result in a similar rate of serious bleeding as warfarin, whereas edoxaban probably increases the rate of serious bleeding compared to warfarin.
We are uncertain if any one type of NOAC is better than another. More research is needed to know for sure.
We have little confidence in the evidence for apixaban and edoxaban because the included studies were small. We are only moderately confident in some of the evidence for rivaroxaban, also due to the small size of studies.

5758a78d768081000631a322,finetuned_5,Degarelix for newly diagnosed advanced prostate cancer,"Degarelix is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist that leads to medical castration used to treat men with advanced or metastatic prostate cancer, or both. It is unclear how its effects compare to standard androgen suppression therapy. We assessed the effects of degarelix compared with standard androgen suppression therapy for men with advanced hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. We searched multiple databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, LILACS until September 2020), trial registries (until October 2020), and conference proceedings (until December 2020). We identified other potentially eligible trials by reference checking, citation searching, and contacting study authors. We included randomized controlled trials comparing degarelix with standard androgen suppression therapy for men with advanced prostate cancer. Three review authors independently classified studies and abstracted data from the included studies. The primary outcomes were overall survival and serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes were quality of life, cancer-specific survival, clinical progression, other adverse events, and biochemical progression. We used a random-effects model for meta-analyses and assessed the certainty of evidence for the main outcomes according to GRADE. We included 11 studies with a follow-up of between three and 14 months. We also identified five ongoing trials. Data to evaluate overall survival were not available. Degarelix may result in little to no difference in serious adverse events compared to standard androgen suppression therapy (risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 1.05; low-certainty evidence; 2750 participants). Based on 114 serious adverse events in the standard androgen suppression group, this corresponds to 23 fewer serious adverse events per 1000 participants (43 fewer to 6 more). We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations and imprecision. Degarelix likely results in little to no difference in quality of life assessed with a variety of validated questionnaires (standardized mean difference 0.06 higher, 95% CI 0.05 lower to 0.18 higher; moderate-certainty evidence; 2887 participants), with higher scores reflecting better quality of life. We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations. Data to evaluate cancer-specific survival were not available. The effects of degarelix on cardiovascular events are very uncertain (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.61; very low-certainty evidence; 80 participants). We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations, imprecision, and indirectness as this trial was conducted in a unique group of high-risk participants with pre-existing cardiovascular morbidities. Degarelix likely results in an increase in injection site pain (RR 15.68, 95% CI 7.41 to 33.17; moderate-certainty evidence; 2670 participants). Based on 30 participants per 1000 with injection site pain with standard androgen suppression therapy, this corresponds to 440 more injection site pains per 1000 participants (192 more to 965 more). We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations. We did not identify any relevant subgroup differences for different degarelix maintenance doses. We did not find trial evidence for overall survival or cancer-specific survival comparing degarelix to standard androgen suppression, but serious adverse events and quality of life may be similar between groups. The effects of degarelix on cardiovascular events are very uncertain as the only eligible study had limitations, was small with few events, and was conducted in a high-risk population. Degarelix likely results in an increase in injection site pain compared to standard androgen suppression therapy. Maximum follow-up of included studies was 14 months, which is short. There is a need for methodologically better designed and executed studies with long-term follow-up evaluating men with metastatic prostate cancer.","How does degarelix, a newer drug that treats prostate cancer by lowering male sex hormone levels, compare to existing medications for newly diagnosed advanced prostate cancer? There is no cure if prostate cancer has spread outside of the prostate gland to lymph nodes or to the bones. In such a situation, hormonal therapy that lowers levels of the male sex hormone testosterone can slow down cancer growth. Testosterone levels are regulated by complicated mechanisms that involve a hormone known as gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which is present in men at different levels at different times of the day. It is understood that giving men with prostate cancer high levels of medications that increase GnRH levels first raises testosterone levels, and then drops them to very low levels. These medications are commonly used to treat men with prostate cancer that has spread outside the prostate. Degarelix is a newer drug known as a GnRH antagonist, which blocks receptors in the brain and thereby lowers testosterone levels immediately. We included randomized controlled trials (studies in which participants are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) comparing degarelix and standard hormonal therapy in men with newly diagnosed advanced prostate cancer. The evidence is current to September 2020 for electronic databases, to October 2020 for trial registries, and to December 2020 for conference proceedings. We found 11 studies that were eligible for inclusion in the review, but none of these studies evaluated the risk of dying from any cause or dying from prostate cancer. There may be no difference between degarelix and standard hormonal therapy in serious unwanted effects and quality of life. The effects of degarelix on cardiovascular issues such as the risk of a heart attack or stroke are uncertain; while one study suggested that the risk may be reduced with degarelix, it had major issues, in particular that it was conducted in men at high risk for such problems. We found that degarelix therapy likely results in an increase in the occurrence of pain at the injection site. The certainty of evidence for the various outcomes ranged from moderate to very low. There is a need for additional, better designed studies to further understand the effects of degarelix for newly diagnosed advanced prostate cancer.",1024,Degarelix; gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist; androgen suppression therapy; metastatic prostate cancer; hormone-sensitive prostate cancer; overall survival; serious adverse events; quality of life; cancer-specific survival; cardiovascular events,How does the evidence regarding cardiovascular events influence the current understanding of degarelix compared to standard therapy?,What could improve the reliability of outcomes related to quality of life in future studies with degarelix?,Select all of the following that are fruits,How do the study's conclusions address the balance between serious adverse events and quality of life?,Which type of prostate cancer was the focus of the study comparing degarelix with standard therapy?,The evidence suggests a reduced risk with degarelix due to lower event rates in standard therapy.; The evidence is inconclusive due to study limitations and focus on high-risk populations.; The evidence supports degarelix as a preferable treatment for all patients because of fewer cardiac events.,The evidence is inconclusive due to study limitations and focus on high-risk populations.,Using a single standardized questionnaire for all studies.; Ensuring consistent data collection methods across studies.; Focusing on quality of life outcomes only in high-risk participant trials.,Ensuring consistent data collection methods across studies.,dog; blue; grape,grape,"The study concludes that there is little difference, suggesting similar benefit-risk profiles.; The conclusions indicate that degarelix has significantly fewer adverse events but similar quality of life.; It concludes that standard therapy provides better outcomes for quality of life but with more adverse events.","The study concludes that there is little difference, suggesting similar benefit-risk profiles.",Newly diagnosed advanced prostate cancer; Localized prostate cancer; Hormone-refractory prostate cancer,Newly diagnosed advanced prostate cancer
5758a78d768081000631a322,finetuned_6,"Education, incentive, and engineering-based interventions to promotethe use of seat belts","Over 1.3 million people die each year as a result of traffic collisions and hundreds of thousands of others are permanently and seriouslyinjured. Most of these deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries, where mortality rates can be up to 10 times higher than those ofsome high-income countries. Seat belts are designed to accomplish two key functions: to prevent the occupant from being ejected fromthe vehicle by the force of impact, and to extend the time that the decelerating force is applied to a person. Seat belts also spread the area ofimpact both to larger and less vulnerable parts of the body. Since the 1950s, seat belts have been factory-fitted to most vehicles, and todayaround 90% of high-income countries have adopted seat belt legislation that makes it mandatory for some, if not all, vehicle occupants towear seat belts. However, the simple passing of laws is not sufficient to ensure seat belt use, and, while the enforcement of seat belt lawsdoes increase seat belt use, other interventions have been developed to encourage voluntary  and hence sustainable behaviour change. To evaluate the benefits of behavioural-change interventions (educational-based, incentive-based, engineering-based, or a combination,but not enforcement-based) that promote the use of seat belts, and to determine which types of interventions are most effective. On 9 August 2022, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), OvidSP Embase, OvidSP MEDLINE, 14other databases, and clinical trials registers. We also screened reference lists and conference proceedings, searched websites of relevantorganisations, and contacted road safety experts. The search was performed with no restrictions in terms of language and date ofpublication. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), both individually randomised and cluster-randomised, that evaluated education,engineering, incentive-based interventions (or combinations) that promoted seat belt use. Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of RCTs, evaluated the risk of bias, and extracted data. We performed a narrativesynthesis based on effect direction due to the heterogeneity observed between RCTs and reported the synthesis in accordance with reporting guidelines for systematic reviews without meta-analysis, as appropriate. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using theGRADE approach. We analysed data on the primary outcome, frequency of wearing a seat belt. None of the included RCTs reported theother primary outcome, crash-related injury rate or the secondary outcome, crash-related mortality rates of interest in this review. We included 15 completed RCTs (12 individual, parallel-group, and three cluster) that enroled 12,081 participants, published between1990 and 2022. Four trials were published between 2019 and 2022, and the remaining trials were published 10 or more years ago. Wealso identified four ongoing RCTs. Thirteen RCTs were conducted in the USA. Trials recruited participants from various sites (worksites,schools, emergency departments, a residential retirement community, and primary care settings) and different age groups (adults,late adolescents, early adolescents, and dyads). Thirteen trials investigated educational interventions, one of which used education inaddition to incentives (one of the intervention arms) measured through participant self-reports (12) and observation (one), and two trialsinvestigated engineering-based interventions measured through in-vehicle data monitor systems at various follow-up periods (six weeksto 36 months). We grouped RCTs according to types of education-based interventions: behavioural education-based, health risk appraisal (HRA), andother education-based interventions. The evidence suggests that behavioural education-based (four trials) interventions may promoteseat belt use and HRA interventions (one trial) likely promote seat belt use in the short term (six weeks to nine months). Four of the sixtrials that investigated behavioural education-based interventions found that the intervention compared to no or another interventionmay promote seat belt use. These effects were measured through participant self-report and at various time points (six-week to 12-monthfollow-up) (low-certainty evidence). One of the three trials investigating HRA only or with additional intervention versus no or anotherintervention showed observed effects likely to promote seat belt use (moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence suggests that engineering-based interventions using vehicle monitoring systems (with in-vehicle alerts and with or withoutnotifications/feedback) may promote the use of seat belts. One trial showed that engineering interventions (in-vehicle alerts and feedback)may promote seat belt use while the other showed unclear effects in two of the three intervention groups (low-certainty evidence). Bothtrials had small sample sizes and high baseline seat belt use. The evidence suggests that behavioural education-based interventions may promote seat belt use and HRA (including incentives) with orwithout additional interventions likely promote seat belt use. Likewise, for engineering-based interventions using in-vehicle data monitorsystems with in-vehicle alerts, with or without notifications/feedback the evidence suggests the interventions may promote the use ofseat belts. Well-designed RCTs are needed to further investigate the effectiveness of education and engineering-based interventions. High-qualitytrials that examine the potential benefits of incentives to promote seat belt use, either alone or in combination with other interventions, aswell as trials to investigate other types of interventions (such as technology, media/publicity, enforcement, insurance schemes, employerprogrammes, etc.) to promote the use of seat belts, are needed. Evidence from low- and middle-income economies is required to improvethe generalisability of the data. In addition, research focused on determining which interventions or types of interventions are mosteffective in different population groups is needed.","Why is wearing a seat belt important? Many people, mostly children and young adults, die each year as a result of road traffic injuries suggesting it to be a leading cause of death with around 75% of traffic-related deaths occurring among young males. Many others are permanently and seriously injured. Seat belts are designed to protect occupants from being thrown out of the vehicle by the force of impact, and spread the impact across less vulnerable parts of the body to lessen the damage. Passing laws mandating seat belt use is not sufficient to encourage seat belt use on its own. We investigated the effectiveness of education, incentive, or engineering-based interventions, but not law enforcement, to encourage seat belt use and determine which types of interventions are most effective. Educational-based interventions are structured programmes teaching drivers and passengers the importance of using seat belts. Engineering-based interventions are design changes to the vehicle structure that promote the wearing of seat belts, such as seat belt alarms, while incentives include rewards schemes. We searched for studies that randomly allocated people travelling in passenger or commercial vehicles to interventions aiming to improve seat belt use. We excluded people travelling in farming or agricultural vehicles since these are not deemed commercial vehicles. Two review authors independently evaluated studies to judge inclusion in the review. We recorded information about the study design, setting, participants, interventions, and outcomes. In terms of outcome, we looked at the frequency of wearing a seat belt as well as crash-related injuries and deaths. Because of the differences between the included studies, we provided a written account and assessed how much each result could be trusted using the ratings high, moderate, low, or very low quality, depending on our confidence in the reliability of the results. We summarised the findings and compared study results. We found 15 studies enrolling 12,081 participants and four ongoing studies. Thirteen studies were conducted in the USA and enrolled participants from various sites (worksites, schools, emergency departments, a residential retirement community, and primary care settings) and of different age groups (adults, late and early adolescents, and dyads of child/adolescent and parent/legal guardian). Twelve studies looked at educational interventions alone, one at education and incentives, and two at engineering-based interventions. All included studies reported on the frequency of wearing a seat belt; however, most studies (12) reported this outcome through participant self-reporting. The remaining studies reported the frequency of wearing a seat belt through in-vehicle data monitoring systems (two studies) and observation (one study). None of the included studies reported crash-related injuries and deaths. Some evidence suggests that education-based and engineering-based interventions may promote seat belt use; however, we cannot be confident in the current evidence. For education-based interventions, evidence suggests that behavioural-based (motivational interviews, behavioural change counselling, and behavioural messages) and HRA (alone or with educational information plus incentive) interventions may improve seat belt use in early adolescents, late adolescents, and adults. The evidence suggests that engineering-based interventions may promote seat belt use in early adolescents and adults. More research is needed to better understand the effectiveness of education- and engineering-based interventions on seat belt use. In addition, high-quality research is needed to investigate the benefit of incentives alone or in combination with other interventions as well as research to investigate other types of interventions, different combinations of interventions, settings (such as low- and middle-income countries), and populations. Only two studies looked at engineering-based interventions to improve seat belt use and both studies enrolled a small number of participants making it challenging to conclude that these interventions are beneficial. Trials investigating educational interventions to improve seat belt use vary in terms of the type of intervention, quality, number and types of people in the study, etc. Studies included children, adolescents, and adults; however, the most effective intervention for each population group remains unclear. Our confidence in the evidence was low or moderate, mainly due to the outcome (wearing seat belts) being measured through participant self-reporting. Self-reported outcomes are open to being influenced by participants answering in a manner they believe to be desirable or by participants' limited recollection of the event being studied.

To assess the effects of dietary interventions for adult cancer survivors on morbidity and mortality, changes in dietary behaviour, body composition, health-related quality of life, and clinical measurements.
We ran searches on 18 September 2019 and searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials (CENTRAL), in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE via Ovid; Embase via Ovid; the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED); the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL); and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE). We searched other resources including reference lists of retrieved articles, other reviews on the topic, the International Trials Registry for ongoing trials, metaRegister, Physicians Data Query, and appropriate websites for ongoing trials. We searched conference abstracts and WorldCat for dissertations.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that recruited people following a cancer diagnosis. The intervention was any dietary advice provided by any method including group sessions, telephone instruction, written materials, or a web-based approach. We included comparisons that could be usual care or written information, and outcomes measured included overall survival, morbidities, secondary malignancies, dietary changes, anthropometry, quality of life (QoL), and biochemistry.
We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Two people independently assessed titles and full-text articles, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. For analysis, we used a random-effects statistical model for all meta-analyses, and the GRADE approach to rate the certainty of evidence, considering limitations, indirectness, inconsistencies, imprecision, and bias.
We included 25 RCTs involving 7259 participants including 977 (13.5%) men and 6282 (86.5%) women. Mean age reported ranged from 52.6 to 71 years, and range of age of included participants was 23 to 85 years. The trials reported 27 comparisons and included participants who had survived breast cancer (17 trials), colorectal cancer (2 trials), gynaecological cancer (1 trial), and cancer at mixed sites (5 trials). For overall survival, dietary intervention and control groups showed little or no difference in risk of mortality (hazard ratio (HR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77 to 1.23; 1 study; 3107 participants; low-certainty evidence). For secondary malignancies, dietary interventions versus control trials reported little or no difference (risk ratio (RR) 0.99, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.15; 1 study; 3107 participants; low-certainty evidence). Co-morbidities were not measured in any included trials. Subsequent outcomes reported after 12 months found that dietary interventions versus control probably make little or no difference in energy intake at 12 months (mean difference (MD) -59.13 kcal, 95% CI -159.05 to 37.79; 5 studies; 3283 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Dietary interventions versus control probably led to slight increases in fruit and vegetable servings (MD 0.41 servings, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.71; 5 studies; 834 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); mixed results for fibre intake overall (MD 5.12 g, 95% CI 0.66 to 10.9; 2 studies; 3127 participants; very low-certainty evidence); and likely improvement in Diet Quality Index (MD 3.46, 95% CI 1.54 to 5.38; 747 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). For anthropometry, dietary intervention versus control probably led to a slightly decreased body mass index (BMI) (MD -0.79 kg/m², 95% CI -1.50 to -0.07; 4 studies; 777 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Dietary interventions versus control probably had little or no effect on waist-to-hip ratio (MD -0.01, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.02; 2 studies; 106 participants; low-certainty evidence). For QoL, there were mixed results; several different quality assessment tools were used and evidence was of low to very low-certainty. No adverse events were reported in any of the included studies.
Evidence demonstrated little effects of dietary interventions on overall mortality and secondary cancers. For comorbidities, no evidence was identified. For nutritional outcomes, there was probably little or no effect on energy intake, although probably a slight increase in fruit and vegetable intake and Diet Quality Index. Results were mixed for fibre. For anthropometry, there was probably a slight decrease in body mass index (BMI) but probably little or no effect on waist-to-hip ratio. For QoL, results were highly varied. Additional high-quality research is needed to examine the effects of dietary interventions for different cancer sites, and to evaluate important outcomes including comorbidities and body composition. Evidence on new technologies used to deliver dietary interventions was limited.","Diet has been linked to cancer, and dietary guidelines are available for cancer prevention. People after cancer have been found to have higher rates of other conditions including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and other cancers. It is therefore sensible for people after cancer to look at changing their diet. It was important to undertake this review to assess the evidence on dietary advice for people who have survived cancer. This review evaluates evidence on dietary interventions for people after cancer. The quality of evidence is generally low to very low. Most studies did not evaluate dietary interventions for key review outcomes, particularly mortality and morbidity. However, a few study outcomes with moderate-certainty evidence focused on dietary intake and physical measurements. Included studies compared dietary interventions versus control or usual care. We pooled data from similar randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to provide a summary estimate of the effects of an intervention, and we judged how confident (certain) we were of these findings by using an established method (GRADE). We identified 25 RCTs involving 27 different comparisons. For some outcomes, we found absence of evidence for dietary interventions. We found some evidence showing that dietary interventions probably did not modify energy intake; however, some evidence shows what is probably a slight increase in fruit and vegetable intake (moderate-certainty evidence). Evidence on dietary fibre was mixed for different advice on weight reducing or healthy eating. Dietary interventions compared to control probably improved the Diet Quality Index (moderate-certainty evidence). For physical measurements, we found a probable reduction in body mass index (BMI) with dietary interventions compared to controls (moderate-certainty evidence) but little evidence showing any change in waist-to-hip ratio (low-certainty evidence). For quality of life (QoL), results were mixed due to the wide variety of tools used. No adverse events were reported. Available evidence shows that dietary interventions can be helpful in modifying fruit and vegetable servings and diet quality; modification of fibre intake was variable, and some benefits were seen for anthropometric measurements, including BMI. Most of the evidence is based on women with breast cancer, so more research is needed for patients with other cancers.

The aim of this review was to assess the effects of conservative (non-surgical) interventions for treating hyperextension injuries of the PIP joints. We searched multiple databases and trial registers up to early 2012. Randomised and quasi-randomised studies comparing immobilisation, protected mobilisation, or unrestricted mobilisation in people with non-surgically managed PIP hyperextension injuries were eligible. Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data, but no pooling was possible. Three trials with 366 participants were identified; all were over 15 years old and had methodological weaknesses with unclear or high risk of bias. None reported self-assessed function. One trial compared unrestricted mobility with immobilisation, one compared protected mobilisation with immobilisation, and one compared immobilisation for one week versus three weeks. None found statistically significant differences between groups in poor outcomes, pain, or range of movement at six months, and for the unrestricted-mobility versus immobilisation comparison, no differences were found even at three years. Overall, evidence from trials is insufficient to guide decisions on whether immobilisation is needed, and if so, for how long or to what extent, when treating PIP hyperextension injuries.","Injury to the ligaments of the middle joint (proximal interphalangeal joint) of a finger may occur as a result of the finger being forced backwards. This is known as a hyperextension injury. Characteristically, this occurs in sporting accidents, such as where a football strikes an outstretched hand. These injuries are common and typically affect people of working age. Usually, these patients are treated without surgery using a combination of support (splinting/strapping to the adjacent finger) and exercise advice. Use of the hand is commonly encouraged but restricted to some degree by the severity of the injury. By examining the evidence from randomised controlled trials, this review aimed to assess which treatment for hyperextension injuries of the proximal interphalangeal joints of the fingers results in the best outcome for patients. The outcomes examined included function (including return to work), pain and joint movement.
Three small studies including a total of 366 patients met the inclusion criteria for the review. The studies, which were all over 15 years old, were prone to bias. None of the studies reported any self assessment of function by participants. One study compared unrestricted mobility with immobilisation. One trial compared protected mobilisation (using a removable support in combination with exercise) with immobilisation. The remaining study compared immobilisation for one week versus three weeks. None of these trials found important differences between their intervention groups in various measures of poor outcome, pain and range of movement at six months follow-up.

We searched CENTRAL in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, and four ongoing trial databases for relevant trials up to 14 December 2015.
Eligible studies were randomised controlled trials comparing autologous adult stem/progenitor cells with no cells in people with chronic ischaemic heart disease and congestive heart failure. We included co-interventions, such as primary angioplasty, surgery, or administration of stem cell mobilising agents, when administered to treatment and control arms equally.
Two review authors independently screened all references for eligibility, assessed trial quality, and extracted data. We undertook a quantitative evaluation of data using random-effects meta-analyses. We evaluated heterogeneity using the I2statistic and explored substantial heterogeneity (I2 greater than 50%) through subgroup analyses. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We created a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADEprofiler (GRADEpro), excluding studies with a high or unclear risk of selection bias. We focused our summary of findings on long-term follow-up of mortality, morbidity outcomes, and left ventricular ejection fraction measured by magnetic resonance imaging.
We included 38 randomised controlled trials involving 1907 participants (1114 cell therapy, 793 controls) in this review update. Twenty-three trials were at high or unclear risk of selection bias. Other sources of potential bias included lack of blinding of participants (12 trials) and full or partial commercial sponsorship (13 trials). Cell therapy reduced the incidence of long-term mortality (? 12 months) (risk ratio (RR) 0.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.21 to 0.87; participants = 491; studies = 9; I2= 0%; low-quality evidence). Periprocedural adverse events associated with the mapping or cell/placebo injection procedure were infrequent. Cell therapy was also associated with a long-term reduction in the incidence of non-fatal myocardial infarction (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.97; participants = 345; studies = 5; I2= 0%; low-quality evidence) and incidence of arrhythmias (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.99; participants = 82; studies = 1; low-quality evidence). However, we found no evidence that cell therapy affects the risk of rehospitalisation for heart failure (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.09; participants = 375; studies = 6; I2= 0%; low-quality evidence) or composite incidence of mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and/or rehospitalisation for heart failure (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.08; participants = 141; studies = 3; I2= 0%; low-quality evidence), or long-term left ventricular ejection fraction when measured by magnetic resonance imaging (mean difference -1.60, 95% CI -8.70 to 5.50; participants = 25; studies = 1; low-quality evidence).
This systematic review and meta-analysis found low-quality evidence that treatment with bone marrow-derived stem/progenitor cells reduces mortality and improves left ventricular ejection fraction over short- and long-term follow-up and may reduce the incidence of non-fatal myocardial infarction and improve New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Classification in people with chronic ischaemic heart disease and congestive heart failure. These findings should be interpreted with caution, as event rates were generally low, leading to a lack of precision.","Are adult stem/progenitor cells derived from bone marrow safe and effective as a treatment for chronic ischaemic heart disease and heart failure?
The current treatment for people suffering from heart disease and heart failure is drugs and, when possible, restoration of the blood supply in the heart (revascularisation) either by opening the arteries with a tiny balloon in a procedure called primary angioplasty (or percutaneous coronary intervention) or by heart surgery (or coronary artery bypass graft). Revascularisation has reduced the death rate associated with these conditions. In some people, heart disease and heart failure symptoms persist even after revascularisation. Recently, bone marrow stem/progenitor cells have been investigated as a new treatment for people with heart disease and heart failure, whether or not they also undergo revascularisation.
We searched electronic databases for relevant randomised controlled trials to December 2015.
We included 38 randomised controlled trials involving more than 1900 participants in this review, with 14 trials of chronic ischaemic heart disease, 17 trials of ischaemic heart failure secondary to heart disease, and seven trials of refractory or intractable angina. The mean age of participants ranged from 55 to 70 years, and the proportion of male participants ranged from 51% to 100%.
The quality of the evidence was low, as the number of included studies and participants is not currently high enough to draw robust conclusions. Thirteen studies received commercial funding, of which four were fully commercially sponsored, and 12 studies did not report that participants were blinded to the treatment they received.

5ba9873edd59150001384069,static_2,Coenzyme Q10 for heart failure,"Coenzyme Q10, or ubiquinone, is a non-prescription nutritional supplement. It is a fat-soluble molecule that acts as an electron carrier in mitochondria, and as a coenzyme for mitochondrial enzymes. Coenzyme Q10 deficiency may be associated with a multitude of diseases, including heart failure. The severity of heart failure correlates with the severity of coenzyme Q10 deficiency. Emerging data suggest that the harmful effects of reactive oxygen species are increased in people with heart failure, and coenzyme Q10 may help to reduce these toxic effects because of its antioxidant activity. Coenzyme Q10 may also have a role in stabilising myocardial calcium-dependent ion channels, and in preventing the consumption of metabolites essential for adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) synthesis. Coenzyme Q10, although not a primary recommended treatment, could be beneficial to people with heart failure. Several randomised controlled trials have compared coenzyme Q10 to other therapeutic modalities, but no systematic review of existing randomised trials was conducted prior to the original version of this Cochrane Review, in 2014. To review the safety and efficacy of coenzyme Q10 in heart failure. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL Plus, and AMED on 16 October 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov on 16 July 2020, and the ISRCTN Registry on 11 November 2019. We applied no language restrictions. We included randomised controlled trials of either parallel or cross-over design that assessed the beneficial and harmful effects of coenzyme Q10 in people with heart failure. When we identified cross-over studies, we considered data only from the first phase. We used standard Cochrane methods, assessed study risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool, and GRADE methods to assess the quality of the evidence. For dichotomous data, we calculated the risk ratio (RR); for continuous data, the mean difference (MD), both with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where appropriate data were available, we conducted meta-analysis. When meta-analysis was not possible, we wrote a narrative synthesis. We provided a PRISMA flow chart to show the flow of study selection. We included eleven studies, with 1573 participants, comparing coenzyme Q10 to placebo or conventional therapy (control). In the majority of the studies, sample size was relatively small. There were important differences among studies in daily coenzyme Q10 dose, follow-up period, and the measures of treatment effect. All studies had unclear, or high risk of bias, or both, in one or more bias domains. We were only able to conduct meta-analysis for some of the outcomes. None of the included trials considered quality of life, measured on a validated scale, exercise variables (exercise haemodynamics), or cost-effectiveness. Coenzyme Q10 probably reduces the risk of all-cause mortality more than control (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.95; 1 study, 420 participants; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 13.3; moderate-quality evidence). There was low-quality evidence of inconclusive results between the coenzyme Q10 and control groups for the risk of myocardial infarction (RR 1.62, 95% CI 0.27 to 9.59; 1 study, 420 participants), and stroke (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.48; 1 study, 420 participants). Coenzyme Q10 probably reduces hospitalisation related to heart failure (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.78; 2 studies, 1061 participants; NNTB 9.7; moderate-quality evidence). Very low-quality evidence suggests that coenzyme Q10 may improve the left ventricular ejection fraction (MD 1.77, 95% CI 0.09 to 3.44; 7 studies, 650 participants), but the results are inconclusive for exercise capacity (MD 48.23, 95% CI -24.75 to 121.20; 3 studies, 91 participants); and the risk of developing adverse events (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.10; 2 studies, 568 participants). We downgraded the quality of the evidence mainly due to high risk of bias and imprecision. The included studies provide moderate-quality evidence that coenzyme Q10 probably reduces all-cause mortality and hospitalisation for heart failure. There is low-quality evidence of inconclusive results as to whether coenzyme Q10 has an effect on the risk of myocardial infarction, or stroke. Because of very low-quality evidence, it is very uncertain whether coenzyme Q10 has an effect on either left ventricular ejection fraction or exercise capacity. There is low-quality evidence that coenzyme Q10 may increase the risk of adverse effects, or have little to no difference. There is currently no convincing evidence to support or refute the use of coenzyme Q10 for heart failure. Future trials are needed to confirm our findings.","Heart failure is a term used to describe the state that develops when the heart cannot maintain adequate cardiac output, or can do so only at the expense of overfilling the heart chambers. People with heart failure commonly experience a relapsing and remitting disease course, with periods of stability and episodes of decompensation (failure to cope with heart damage), leading to worsening symptoms that necessitate hospitalisation.
Treatment options for heart failure range from drugs to heart transplantation, with each having its own limitations. Coenzyme Q10 (or ubiquinone) has been suggested as a treatment option in some trials. Coenzyme Q10 is a non-prescription nutritional supplement. It is a fat-soluble molecule that has a role in energy production within the cells of the body. It may also have antioxidant properties.
Low levels of coenzyme Q10 may be related to the severity of heart failure. Coenzyme Q10 has been found in all tissues and organs in the body, with the highest concentrations in the heart. Emerging data have suggested that the harmful effects of reactive oxygen species (unstable molecules that contains oxygen and easily reacts with other molecules) are increased in people with heart failure. Because of its antioxidant activity, coenzyme Q10 may help to reduce these toxic effects, which damage the components of the cardiac cells, and disrupt cellular signalling. Coenzyme Q10 plays an important role in conducting signals within the heart muscle and in generating energy.The concentration of coenzyme Q10 has been inversely related to the severity of heart failure. Supplementation with coenzyme Q10 may improve heart failure. Coenzyme Q10 is sometimes used because it is thought to have an acceptable safety profile, with no significant side effects.
We conducted this review to assess the available evidence on the effects of coenzyme Q10 in people with heart failure. We included 11 randomised controlled trials, involving 1573 participants. They were relatively small, and followed up participants for a relatively short period of time. The analyses show that coenzyme Q10 probably reduces the risk of mortality from all causes, and hospitalisations due to heart failure. It may result in increased, or little or no difference in the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, or adverse events. The effect of coenzyme Q10 on cardiac function and symptom improvement is uncertain.
The evidence, current to October 2020, is of a moderate quality at best, because of the high risk of bias in some of the included studies and the absence of precise and consistent results. There is currently no convincing evidence to support or refute the use of coenzyme Q10 for heart failure.",1034,Coenzyme Q10; mitochondria; antioxidant activity; heart failure; reactive oxygen species; all-cause mortality; myocardial infarction; left ventricular ejection fraction; exercise capacity; adverse events,In what ways did the methodological differences among the studies contribute to the uncertainty in results?,"Based on the evidence provided, how would you evaluate the potential of coenzyme Q10 as a treatment for reducing all-cause mortality in heart failure patients?",Select all of the following that are colors,What does coenzyme Q10 aim to address in heart failure according to the summary?,"According to the review, what is a potential effect of coenzyme Q10 on hospitalization rates for heart failure?",Variations in study design may introduce bias; Uniformity in study designs led to precise conclusions; Differences in treatment effect measures reduce consistency,Variations in study design may introduce bias; Differences in treatment effect measures reduce consistency,Moderately promising due to reduced mortality risk; Unsupported due to lack of evidence on cardiac function; Convincing based on the quality of the evidence,Moderately promising due to reduced mortality risk,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Increase cardiac output; Reduce the harmful effects of reactive oxygen species; Stimulate heart transplantation,Reduce the harmful effects of reactive oxygen species,It probably reduces the risk; It definitely increases the risk; It has no effect,It probably reduces the risk
5ba9873edd59150001384069,interactive_3,What are the benefits and risks of cognitive rehabilitation for people with mild-to-moderate dementia?,"Cognitive impairments affect functional ability in people with dementia. Cognitive rehabilitation (CR) is a personalised, solution-focused approach that aims to enable people with mild-to-moderate dementia to manage everyday activities and maintain as much independence as possible. To evaluate the effects of CR on everyday functioning and other outcomes for people with mild-to-moderate dementia, and on outcomes for care partners. To identify and explore factors that may be associated with the efficacy of CR. We searched the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialised Register, which contains records from MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, LILACS, and other clinical trial databases, and grey literature sources. The most recent search was completed on 19 October 2022. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing CR with control conditions and reporting relevant outcomes for the person with dementia and/or the care partner. We extracted relevant data from published manuscripts and contacted trial authors if necessary. Within each of the comparisons, we pooled data for each outcome of interest and conducted inverse-variance, random-effects meta-analyses. We evaluated the certainty of the evidence using GRADEpro GDT. We identified six eligible RCTs published in English between 2010 and 2022, which together included 1702 participants. The mean age of participants ranged from 76 to 80 and the proportion of male participants was between 29.4% and 79.3%. Most participants, in the studies where the type of dementia was reported, had a diagnosis of Alzheimers disease (AD; n = 1002, 58.9% of the whole sample, 81.2% of the participants for whom the specific diagnosis was reported). Risk of bias in the individual studies was relatively low. The exception was a high risk of bias in relation to blinding of participants and practitioners, which is not usually feasible with psychosocial interventions. Our primary outcome of everyday functioning was operationalised in the included studies as goal attainment in relation to activities targeted in the intervention. For our main comparison of CR with usual care, we pooled data for goal attainment evaluated from three perspectives (self-rating of performance, informant rating of performance, and self-rating of satisfaction with performance) at end of treatment and at medium-term follow-up (3 to 12 months). We could also pool data at these time points for 20 and 19 secondary outcomes respectively. The review findings were strongly driven by one large, high-quality RCT. We found high-certainty evidence of large positive effects of CR on all three primary outcome perspectives at the end of treatment: participant self-ratings of goal attainment (standardised mean difference (SMD) 1.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.26 to 1.66; I2 = 0%; 3 RCTs, 501 participants), informant ratings of goal attainment (SMD 1.61, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.21; I2 = 41%; 3 RCTs, 476 participants), and self-ratings of satisfaction with goal attainment (SMD 1.31, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.54; I2 = 5%; 3 RCTs, 501 participants), relative to an inactive control condition. At medium-term follow-up, we found high-certainty evidence showing a large positive effect of CR on all three primary outcome perspectives: participant self-ratings of goal attainment (SMD 1.46, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.68; I2 = 0%; 2 RCTs, 432 participants), informant ratings of goal attainment (SMD 1.25, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.72; I2 = 29%; 3 RCTs, 446 participants), and self-ratings of satisfaction with goal attainment (SMD 1.19, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.66; I2 = 28%; 2 RCTs, 432 participants), relative to an inactive control condition. For participants at the end of treatment we found high-certainty evidence showing a small positive effect of CR on self-efficacy (2 RCTs, 456 participants) and immediate recall (2 RCTs, 459 participants). For participants at medium-term follow-up we found moderate-certainty evidence showing a small positive effect of CR on auditory selective attention (2 RCTs, 386 participants), and a small negative effect on general functional ability (3 RCTs, 673 participants), and we found low-certainty evidence showing a small positive effect on sustained attention (2 RCTs, 413 participants), and a small negative effect on memory (2 RCTs, 51 participants) and anxiety (3 RCTs, 455 participants). We found moderate- and low-certainty evidence indicating that at the end of treatment CR had negligible effects on participant anxiety, quality of life, sustained attention, memory, delayed recall, and general functional ability, and at medium-term follow-up on participant self-efficacy, depression, quality of life, immediate recall, and verbal fluency. For care partners at the end of treatment we found low-certainty evidence showing a small positive effect on environmental aspects of quality of life (3 RCTs, 465 care partners), and small negative effects of CR on level of depression (2 RCTs, 32 care partners) and on psychological wellbeing (2 RCTs, 388 care partners). For care partners at medium-term follow-up we found high-certainty evidence showing a small positive effect of CR on social aspects of quality of life (3 RCTs, 436 care partners) and moderate-certainty evidence showing a small positive effect on psychological aspects of quality of life (3 RCTs, 437 care partners). We found moderate- and low-certainty evidence at the end of treatment that CR had negligible effects on care partners physical health, psychological and social aspects of quality of life, and stress, and at medium-term follow-up for the physical health aspect of care partners quality of life and psychological wellbeing. CR is helpful in enabling people with mild or moderate dementia to improve their ability to manage the everyday activities targeted in the intervention. Confidence in these findings could be strengthened if more high-quality studies contributed to the observed effects. The available evidence suggests that CR can form a valuable part of a clinical toolkit to assist people with dementia in overcoming some of the everyday barriers imposed by cognitive and functional difficulties. Future research, including process evaluation studies, could help identify avenues to maximise CR effects and achieve wider impacts on functional ability and wellbeing.","Dementia is a group of symptoms caused by changes in the brain that get worse over time. People with some types of dementia have difficulties with memory, planning, concentrating, and communicating. These and other thinking difficulties are collectively described by the umbrella term, 'cognitive impairment'. Cognitive impairment makes it harder to do daily activities and stay independent for as long as possible.
Cognitive rehabilitation is a personalised intervention. People have one-to-one sessions with a practitioner, usually in their own home. People identify everyday activities and tasks that they would like to manage better or do more independently. The practitioner suggests strategies and works with them to help achieve these improvements in the activities that are important to them. Family members are often involved as well.
We explored whether cognitive rehabilitation was better than usual treatment for: doing a chosen task or activity that matters to the person; managing daily activities; feeling confident about being able to manage things; feeling depressed or anxious; having a sense of wellbeing. We also explored whether cognitive rehabilitation was better for ensuring the wellbeing of the care partner - usually a husband, wife, or other close family member.
We searched for studies that rigorously tested the effects of cognitive rehabilitation for people with mild-to-moderate dementia. In these studies, some people had their usual treatment and others had their usual treatment plus cognitive rehabilitation. This made it possible to see whether cognitive rehabilitation was more helpful than usual treatment alone. We compared and summarised the results of the studies. We rated our confidence in the evidence the studies provided, based on the methods used and the numbers of people involved. We found six studies. They involved 1702 people with mild-to-moderate dementia, who had between 8 and 14 sessions with a cognitive rehabilitation practitioner. Alzheimers disease was the most common dementia diagnosis (59% of all participants, 82% of participants with the specific diagnosis reported).
The main findings are that, compared to people who just had their usual treatment, people who had cognitive rehabilitation got better at doing their chosen tasks or activities.
This improvement was seen by the people with dementia and by their care partners. The improvement was seen straight after cognitive rehabilitation and was still noticeable 3 to 12 months later.
Straight after cognitive rehabilitation, compared to people who just had their usual treatment, people with dementia may feel more confident about how they are managing.
There might not be any differences in the wellbeing of people with dementia and their care partners. We are not sure if there are any differences for people with dementia in managing other tasks or activities or in feeling depressed. Three to 12 months after cognitive rehabilitation, compared to usual treatment, care partners may have better psychological wellbeing.
There may not be any differences in how well people with dementia manage other tasks or activities, in how confident or depressed they feel, or in their wellbeing.
Our review included six studies, but the findings are based mostly on information from one large study. We do not know if the effects of cognitive rehabilitation last more than a year.

5ba9873edd59150001384069,interactive_4,"Education, incentive, and engineering-based interventions to promotethe use of seat belts","Over 1.3 million people die each year as a result of traffic collisions and hundreds of thousands of others are permanently and seriouslyinjured. Most of these deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries, where mortality rates can be up to 10 times higher than those ofsome high-income countries. Seat belts are designed to accomplish two key functions: to prevent the occupant from being ejected fromthe vehicle by the force of impact, and to extend the time that the decelerating force is applied to a person. Seat belts also spread the area ofimpact both to larger and less vulnerable parts of the body. Since the 1950s, seat belts have been factory-fitted to most vehicles, and todayaround 90% of high-income countries have adopted seat belt legislation that makes it mandatory for some, if not all, vehicle occupants towear seat belts. However, the simple passing of laws is not sufficient to ensure seat belt use, and, while the enforcement of seat belt lawsdoes increase seat belt use, other interventions have been developed to encourage voluntary  and hence sustainable behaviour change. To evaluate the benefits of behavioural-change interventions (educational-based, incentive-based, engineering-based, or a combination,but not enforcement-based) that promote the use of seat belts, and to determine which types of interventions are most effective. On 9 August 2022, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), OvidSP Embase, OvidSP MEDLINE, 14other databases, and clinical trials registers. We also screened reference lists and conference proceedings, searched websites of relevantorganisations, and contacted road safety experts. The search was performed with no restrictions in terms of language and date ofpublication. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), both individually randomised and cluster-randomised, that evaluated education,engineering, incentive-based interventions (or combinations) that promoted seat belt use. Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of RCTs, evaluated the risk of bias, and extracted data. We performed a narrativesynthesis based on effect direction due to the heterogeneity observed between RCTs and reported the synthesis in accordance with reporting guidelines for systematic reviews without meta-analysis, as appropriate. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using theGRADE approach. We analysed data on the primary outcome, frequency of wearing a seat belt. None of the included RCTs reported theother primary outcome, crash-related injury rate or the secondary outcome, crash-related mortality rates of interest in this review. We included 15 completed RCTs (12 individual, parallel-group, and three cluster) that enroled 12,081 participants, published between1990 and 2022. Four trials were published between 2019 and 2022, and the remaining trials were published 10 or more years ago. Wealso identified four ongoing RCTs. Thirteen RCTs were conducted in the USA. Trials recruited participants from various sites (worksites,schools, emergency departments, a residential retirement community, and primary care settings) and different age groups (adults,late adolescents, early adolescents, and dyads). Thirteen trials investigated educational interventions, one of which used education inaddition to incentives (one of the intervention arms) measured through participant self-reports (12) and observation (one), and two trialsinvestigated engineering-based interventions measured through in-vehicle data monitor systems at various follow-up periods (six weeksto 36 months). We grouped RCTs according to types of education-based interventions: behavioural education-based, health risk appraisal (HRA), andother education-based interventions. The evidence suggests that behavioural education-based (four trials) interventions may promoteseat belt use and HRA interventions (one trial) likely promote seat belt use in the short term (six weeks to nine months). Four of the sixtrials that investigated behavioural education-based interventions found that the intervention compared to no or another interventionmay promote seat belt use. These effects were measured through participant self-report and at various time points (six-week to 12-monthfollow-up) (low-certainty evidence). One of the three trials investigating HRA only or with additional intervention versus no or anotherintervention showed observed effects likely to promote seat belt use (moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence suggests that engineering-based interventions using vehicle monitoring systems (with in-vehicle alerts and with or withoutnotifications/feedback) may promote the use of seat belts. One trial showed that engineering interventions (in-vehicle alerts and feedback)may promote seat belt use while the other showed unclear effects in two of the three intervention groups (low-certainty evidence). Bothtrials had small sample sizes and high baseline seat belt use. The evidence suggests that behavioural education-based interventions may promote seat belt use and HRA (including incentives) with orwithout additional interventions likely promote seat belt use. Likewise, for engineering-based interventions using in-vehicle data monitorsystems with in-vehicle alerts, with or without notifications/feedback the evidence suggests the interventions may promote the use ofseat belts. Well-designed RCTs are needed to further investigate the effectiveness of education and engineering-based interventions. High-qualitytrials that examine the potential benefits of incentives to promote seat belt use, either alone or in combination with other interventions, aswell as trials to investigate other types of interventions (such as technology, media/publicity, enforcement, insurance schemes, employerprogrammes, etc.) to promote the use of seat belts, are needed. Evidence from low- and middle-income economies is required to improvethe generalisability of the data. In addition, research focused on determining which interventions or types of interventions are mosteffective in different population groups is needed.","Why is wearing a seat belt important? Many people, mostly children and young adults, die each year as a result of road traffic injuries suggesting it to be a leading cause of death with around 75% of traffic-related deaths occurring among young males. Many others are permanently and seriously injured. Seat belts are designed to protect occupants from being thrown out of the vehicle by the force of impact, and spread the impact across less vulnerable parts of the body to lessen the damage. Passing laws mandating seat belt use is not sufficient to encourage seat belt use on its own. We investigated the effectiveness of education, incentive, or engineering-based interventions, but not law enforcement, to encourage seat belt use and determine which types of interventions are most effective. Educational-based interventions are structured programmes teaching drivers and passengers the importance of using seat belts. Engineering-based interventions are design changes to the vehicle structure that promote the wearing of seat belts, such as seat belt alarms, while incentives include rewards schemes. We searched for studies that randomly allocated people travelling in passenger or commercial vehicles to interventions aiming to improve seat belt use. We excluded people travelling in farming or agricultural vehicles since these are not deemed commercial vehicles. Two review authors independently evaluated studies to judge inclusion in the review. We recorded information about the study design, setting, participants, interventions, and outcomes. In terms of outcome, we looked at the frequency of wearing a seat belt as well as crash-related injuries and deaths. Because of the differences between the included studies, we provided a written account and assessed how much each result could be trusted using the ratings high, moderate, low, or very low quality, depending on our confidence in the reliability of the results. We summarised the findings and compared study results. We found 15 studies enrolling 12,081 participants and four ongoing studies. Thirteen studies were conducted in the USA and enrolled participants from various sites (worksites, schools, emergency departments, a residential retirement community, and primary care settings) and of different age groups (adults, late and early adolescents, and dyads of child/adolescent and parent/legal guardian). Twelve studies looked at educational interventions alone, one at education and incentives, and two at engineering-based interventions. All included studies reported on the frequency of wearing a seat belt; however, most studies (12) reported this outcome through participant self-reporting. The remaining studies reported the frequency of wearing a seat belt through in-vehicle data monitoring systems (two studies) and observation (one study). None of the included studies reported crash-related injuries and deaths. Some evidence suggests that education-based and engineering-based interventions may promote seat belt use; however, we cannot be confident in the current evidence. For education-based interventions, evidence suggests that behavioural-based (motivational interviews, behavioural change counselling, and behavioural messages) and HRA (alone or with educational information plus incentive) interventions may improve seat belt use in early adolescents, late adolescents, and adults. The evidence suggests that engineering-based interventions may promote seat belt use in early adolescents and adults. More research is needed to better understand the effectiveness of education- and engineering-based interventions on seat belt use. In addition, high-quality research is needed to investigate the benefit of incentives alone or in combination with other interventions as well as research to investigate other types of interventions, different combinations of interventions, settings (such as low- and middle-income countries), and populations. Only two studies looked at engineering-based interventions to improve seat belt use and both studies enrolled a small number of participants making it challenging to conclude that these interventions are beneficial. Trials investigating educational interventions to improve seat belt use vary in terms of the type of intervention, quality, number and types of people in the study, etc. Studies included children, adolescents, and adults; however, the most effective intervention for each population group remains unclear. Our confidence in the evidence was low or moderate, mainly due to the outcome (wearing seat belts) being measured through participant self-reporting. Self-reported outcomes are open to being influenced by participants answering in a manner they believe to be desirable or by participants' limited recollection of the event being studied.

5ba9873edd59150001384069,interactive_4,Do non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive medicines for steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome in children help prevent relapse?,"About 80% of children with steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SSNS) have relapses. Of these children, half will relapse frequently, and are at risk of adverse effects from corticosteroids. While non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive medications prolong periods of remission, they have significant potential adverse effects. Currently, there is no consensus about the most appropriate second-line agent in children with frequently relapsing SSNS. In addition, these medications could be used with corticosteroids in the initial episode of SSNS to prolong the period of remission. This is the fifth update of a review first published in 2001 and updated in 2005, 2008, 2013 and 2020. To evaluate the benefits and harms of non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive medications in SSNS in children with a relapsing course of SSNS and in children with their first episode of nephrotic syndrome.
We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to October 2024 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs were included if they involved children with SSNS and compared non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive medications with placebo, corticosteroids or no treatment; different non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive medications, or different doses, durations or routes of administration of the same non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive medication. Two authors independently assessed study eligibility, risk of bias and extracted data from the included studies. Statistical analyses were performed using a random-effects model and results expressed as risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes or mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. We identified 58 studies (122 reports) randomising 3720 children. Half were multicentre studies, and most studies were undertaken in South and East Asia (28 studies) and Europe (20 studies). The numbers of children randomised ranged from 14 to 211. Risk of bias assessment indicated that 32 and 33 studies were at low risk of bias for sequence generation and allocation concealment, respectively. Eleven studies were at low risk of performance bias and 13 were at low risk of detection bias. Forty-eight and 36 studies were at low risk of incomplete and selective reporting, respectively. Rituximab with or without prednisone compared with placebo with or without prednisone probably reduces the number of children experiencing relapse at six months (5 studies, 182 children: RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.43) and 12 months (3 studies, 108 children: RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.09) (moderate certainty), may increase the number with severe infusion reactions (4 studies, 162 children: RR 5.21, 95% CI 1.19 to 22.89; low certainty), but not severe infection or arthropathy (low certainty). Rituximab compared with tacrolimus probably reduces the risk of relapse at 12 months (4 studies, 238 children: RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.96)and may reduce the risk of relapse whencompared with low dose mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (1 study, 30 children: RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.62). Rituximab followed by MMF for 500 days reduces the risk of relapse compared with rituximab followed by placebo for 500 days (1 study, 78 children: RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.63; high certainty). Rituximab probably does not differ from ofatumumab in the riisk of relapse and 12 months (1 study, 140 children: RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.41; moderate certainty) or in adverse events. MMF and levamisole (1 study, 149 children: RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.16) may have similar effects on the number of children who relapse at 12 months (low certainty). Cyclosporin compared with MMF may reduce the risk of relapse at 12 months (3 studies, 114 children: RR 1.57, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.30) (low certainty). Levamisole compared with steroids or placebo may reduce the number of children with relapse during treatment (8 studies, 474 children: RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.82) (low certainty). Preliminary data from single studies indicate that levamisole and prednisone compared with prednisone alone may delay the onset of relapse after the initial episode of SSNS and that levamisole compared with increasing prednisone administration from alternate day to daily at the onset of infection may reduce the risk of relapse with infection (low certainty). Cyclosporin compared with prednisone may reduce the number of children who relapse (1 study, 104 children: RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.83) (low certainty). Alkylating agents compared with cyclosporin may make little or no difference to the risk of relapse during cyclosporin treatment (2 studies, 95 children: RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.48) (low certainty evidence) but may reduce the risk of relapse at 12 to 24 months (2 studies, 95 children: RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.74) (low certainty). Alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil) compared with prednisone probably reduce the number of children who experience relapse at six to 12 months (6 studies, 202 children: RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.60) and at 12 to 24 months (4 studies, 59 children: RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.46) (moderate certainty). New studies incorporated in this review update indicate that rituximab compared with prednisone, tacrolimus, or MMF is a valuable additional agent for managing children with relapsing SSNS. Comparative studies of CNIs, MMF, and levamisole suggest that CNIs may be more effective than MMF and that levamisole may be similar in efficacy to MMF. Important new studies suggest that MMF prolongs remission following rituximab, that levamisole may prevent infection-related relapse more effectively than changing from alternate-day to daily prednisone and that levamisole and prednisone compared with prednisone alone may prolong the time to first relapse. There are currently 23 ongoing studies which should improve our understanding of how to treat children with frequently relapsing SSNS.","Children with nephrotic syndrome lose large amounts of protein from their bloodstream into their urine, causing swelling, especially in the face, stomach and legs. The risk of infection also increases because important proteins used by children's immune systems are lost in the urine. Corticosteroid medication, such as prednisone, can stop protein loss, but this often happens again (relapse). Giving children further corticosteroids can lead to poor growth, cataracts, osteoporosis (a condition in which bones become weak and brittle) and high blood pressure. A wide range of medicines have been tried to treat relapses in children and to prevent further relapses in children who relapse frequently. Immunosuppressive medicines (medicines that dampen down the body's immune system) have different mechanisms of action and have been demonstrated to provide longer remission (a period of time when signs and symptoms of nephrotic syndrome disappear) compared with steroids alone. Using these may enable steroids to be withdrawn or the dose reduced. We wanted to find out the best treatment options for children who have frequent relapses of nephrotic syndrome to stop the leaking of protein from the blood into the urine and to avoid the harmful side effects of steroids. We also wanted to find out if these other treatment options were associated with any unwanted effects. We searched for all studies that compared the benefits and harms of randomly allocating non-steroid immunosuppressive medicines to children who have frequent repeated episodes of nephrotic syndrome. We compared and summarised the studies' results and rated our confidence in the information based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 58 studies randomising 3720 children looking at a wide variety of non-steroid treatment options. Half of the studies were conducted in multiple centres around the world, and most were done in South and East Asia (28 studies) and Europe (20 studies). The number of children randomised ranged from 14 to 211. Rituximab compared to a placebo (dummy medicine) probably reduces the risk of a relapse at six and 12 months, but may increase the number who have severe reactions to the infusion. Rituximab probably reduces the risk of relapse at 12 months when compared to tacrolimus, and may reduce the risk when compared to mycophenolate mofetil. We also found that mycophenolate mofetil prolongs the length of remission induced by rituximab. Tacrolimus, cyclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil, and levamisole may reduce the risk of relapse in children with frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome. Cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil compared with steroids probably reduce the number of children who experience a relapse. We are confident that mycophenolate mofetil prolongs the length of remission induced by rituximab. We are moderately confident that rituximab compared to placebo or tacrolimus reduces the risk of relapse in children who experience frequent relapses of nephrotic syndrome. We are also moderately confident that cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil compared with steroids probably reduce the number of children who experience a relapse. We are less confident about the effects of other non-steroid immunosuppressive medicines on reducing the risk of relapse. We are not confident in the evidence for adverse events, as they were rarely or poorly reported for all of our comparisons.",1088,Steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome; relapses; corticosteroids; immunosuppressive medications; rituximab; prednisone; tacrolimus; mycophenolate mofetil; cyclosporin; alkylating agents,What condition in children is associated with protein loss in the urine?,What are some possible side effects of corticosteroid use in children?,Select all of the following that are colors,How does rituximab compare to a placebo in preventing relapse?,Which medication is believed to prolong remission induced by rituximab?,Nephrotic syndrome; Osteoporosis; Cataracts,Nephrotic syndrome,High blood pressure; Improved growth; Cataracts,High blood pressure; Cataracts,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Probably reduces the risk of relapse; Has no effect on relapse risk; Increases risk of relapse,Probably reduces the risk of relapse,Mycophenolate mofetil; Levamisole; Cyclosporin,Mycophenolate mofetil
5ba9873edd59150001384069,finetuned_5,What are the benefits and harms of remote ischaemic conditioning (briefly restricting then restoring blood flow) for preventing and treating stroke?,"Remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) has been developed as a neuroprotective strategy to prevent and treat ischaemic stroke. It usually involves restricting blood flow to limbs and then releasing the ischaemic blood to promote a neuroprotective effect. Preclinical studies have suggested that RIC may have beneficial effects in ischaemic stroke patients and those at risk of ischaemic stroke. However, existing evidence is insufficient to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of RIC in preventing and treating ischaemic stroke. To evaluate the benefits and harms of remote ischaemic conditioning in preventing and treating ischaemic stroke compared to sham or standard treatments. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, three Chinese databases, five trials registers, and conference proceedings, together with reference checking and citation searching. The latest search date was 11 March 2025. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing RIC with sham RIC or medical management in people with ischaemic stroke or at risk of ischaemic stroke. Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed trial quality and risk of bias, and extracted data. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence. We included seven trials, involving 735 participants, in this review. We analysed the effects of RIC on preventing and treating ischaemic stroke respectively. We evaluated risk of bias and judged it to be low for generation of allocation sequence in six studies and unclear in one study; unclear for allocation concealment in four studies and low in three studies; high for incomplete outcome data (attrition bias) in five studies and low in two studies; high for blinding in three studies and low in four studies; low for selective reporting; and high for other sources of bias in six studies and low in one study. We included three trials (involving 371 participants) in the analysis of the effects of RIC on ischaemic stroke prevention. In people with symptomatic intracerebral artery stenosis, recurrent stroke was significantly reduced by RIC (risk ratio (RR) 0.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12 to 0.83; 2 trials, 182 participants, low-quality evidence). In people with carotid stenosis undergoing carotid stenting, there was no significant difference in the incidence of ischaemic stroke between participants treated with RIC and non-RIC (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.03; 1 trial, 189 participants, low-quality evidence); however the stroke severity (assessed by infarct volume) was significantly lower in participants treated with RIC (mean difference (MD) -0.17 mL, 95% CI -0.23 to -0.11; 1 trial, 189 participants, low-quality evidence). Adverse events associated with RIC were significantly higher in participants treated with RIC (RR 10.91; 95% CI 2.01 to 59.28; 3 trials, 371 participants, low-quality evidence), but no severe adverse event was attributable to RIC treatment. No participants experienced death or cardiovascular events during the period of the studies; and no trial reported haemorrhagic stroke or improvement in neurological, phycological or cognitive impairment. We included four trials (involving 364 participants) in the analysis of the effects of RIC on ischaemic stroke treatment. In acute ischaemic stroke, for people receiving intravenous thrombolysis, the rate of death or dependency was significantly increased by RIC treatment compared with non-RIC treatment (RR 2.34; 95% 1.19 to 4.61; 1 trial, 285 participants, low-quality evidence). In people with acute ischaemic stroke, there was no significant difference between RIC and non-RIC for reducing stroke severity as assessed by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score and the final infarct volume (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.24 mL, 95% CI -1.02 to 0.54; 2 trials, 175 participants, very low quality evidence). There was no significant difference between RIC and non-RIC for improving the psychological impairment (SMD -0.37 points, 95% CI -1.15 to 0.41; 1 trial, 26 participants, very low quality evidence) and the cognitive impairment (SMD -0.26 points; 95% CI -0.72 to 0.21; 3 trials, 79 participants, low-quality evidence) in people with acute ischaemic stroke and cerebral small vessel disease. No trial reported ischaemic stroke, recurrent ischaemic stroke, improvement in neurological impairment, hemorrhagic stroke, cardiovascular events, and RIC associated adverse events. There is moderate-certainty evidence that RIC compared to non-RIC probably reduces recurrence of ischaemic stroke slightly, and low-certainty evidence that RIC may result in a slight increase in excellent functional outcome (mRS 0 to 1). Evidence for improvement in NIHSS scores is very uncertain due to risk of bias and imprecision. RIC demonstrated an acceptable harm profile with no increase in intracerebral haemorrhage or mortality; however, treatment-related adverse events were more common. The certainty of evidence was limited by high risk of bias for blinding in most studies, incomplete outcome data in some studies, and imprecision in several outcomes. However, the generalisability of these findings may be limited because 79.3% of participants were from China, highlighting the need for further studies in diverse populations to confirm the results. The optimal timing, duration, and method of RIC administration require further investigation through large, high-quality randomised trials with standardised protocols to establish definitive evidence for clinical practice. This updated analysis includes 16 new RCTs, and these findings highlight the need for ongoing research and careful consideration of study design and methodology in future investigations.","Ischaemic stroke is the most common type of stroke. It occurs when a blood clot blocks an artery that supplies blood to the brain. This blockage cuts off the supply of oxygen and nutrients to a part of the brain. Without this blood supply, brain cells in that area are damaged and begin to die. Remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) involves briefly and repeatedly restricting and then restoring blood flow in a limb (an arm or leg) with a blood pressure cuff. The goal is to ""condition"" the limb and trigger the body's natural defences to protect other organs. Studies have found that for people who have had a stroke and are receiving standard medical care, adding RIC can reduce the amount of brain tissue damaged by the stroke, improve recovery of everyday functions, help prevent another stroke from happening, and reduce problems with memory and thinking.
We wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of RIC in people who have had an ischaemic stroke and are undergoing various treatments, including standard medical therapy, intravenous thrombolysis (a clot-dissolving treatment), or mechanical thrombectomy (a procedure to remove clots). Specifically, we wanted to know if RIC was better than sham or standard treatment for improving:
- the risk of dying;
- the risk of having another stroke;
- the likelihood of an excellent recovery (a score on the Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) of 0 to 1);
- the likelihood of being able to live independently (mRS score of 0 to 2);
- the risk of a brain bleed;
- brain function issues;
- the risk of major heart problems.
We also wanted to know if RIC has unwanted effects.
We searched for studies that compared the benefits and harms of remote ischaemic conditioning in people with ischaemic stroke. We then compared and summarised the study results and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and sample sizes.
We found 21 studies with 7687 people. The studies took place in China, Denmark, France, the UK, and Romania, and were published between 2012 and 2025.
Sixteen studies including 6828 participants suggested that RIC compared to sham or no treatment probably leads to a slight reduction in the risk of having another stroke. About half the studies measured participants' level of independence using the mRS and measured change in brain function issues using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). RIC might lead to a slight increase in the number of people achieving an excellent recovery, but may have little or no effect on the number of people being able to live independently. In addition, RIC might result in a slight improvement in brain function issues, but the evidence is very uncertain. There may be little or no difference between RIC and sham or standard treatment in the risk of a brain bleed and major heart problems, and RIC probably does not increase the risk of death. However, RIC may have unwanted effects such as arm pain, redness, or swelling.
We also identified 21 ongoing studies that we plan to add to the next version of our review.
Our confidence in the evidence is moderate to very low for several reasons. Most studies had few participants, and more than half of studies were done in China, which means the results of our review may not apply to people in other parts of the world. Some studies included people who received clot-dissolving treatment (thrombolysis) and people who did not, and we could not separate the results for these two groups. This mix of patients may have affected our overall analysis. Finally, we did not separate the results in our analysis based on the type of comparison group used (sham or standard treatment). This means it is difficult to know if the treatment effect we found was influenced by the type of comparison.",1069,Ischaemic stroke; Remote ischaemic conditioning; Neuroprotective effect; Symptomatic intracerebral artery stenosis; Carotid stenosis; Intravenous thrombolysis; Infarct volume; National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale; Carotid stenting,What is the primary goal of remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) mentioned in the summary?,What effects of RIC on brain function issues were summarized?,Select the items that are animals,How does RIC compare to sham or standard treatment in terms of stroke recurrence risk?,What was evaluated alongside the benefits of RIC in the summary?,To dissolve existing blood clots in the brain.; To trigger the body's natural defenses to protect other organs.; To permanently restrict blood flow to limbs.,To trigger the body's natural defenses to protect other organs.,RIC might result in a slight improvement in brain function issues.; RIC causes significant decline in cognitive function.; RIC has no impact on brain function issues.,RIC might result in a slight improvement in brain function issues.,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,RIC probably leads to a slight reduction in the risk of having another stroke.; RIC significantly increases the risk of recurrent stroke.; RIC has no effect on stroke recurrence risk.,RIC probably leads to a slight reduction in the risk of having another stroke.,The harms of RIC were also evaluated.; Only the economic cost of RIC was evaluated.; RIC's compatibility with other conditions was evaluated.,The harms of RIC were also evaluated.
5ba9873edd59150001384069,finetuned_6,Methotrexate for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis,"Methotrexate has been used to treat patients with primary biliary cirrhosis because it possesses immunosuppressive properties, and a previous 2005 review showed that methotrexate seemed to significantly increase mortality in these patients; since then, follow-up data from the included trials have been published. This review assessed the beneficial and harmful effects of methotrexate for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. Randomised clinical trials were identified through searches of The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE (from inception to September 2009), reference list screening, and by contacting trial authors. Trials comparing methotrexate with placebo, no intervention, or another drug were included regardless of blinding, language, year, or publication status. Primary outcomes were mortality and mortality combined with liver transplantation; dichotomous outcomes were reported as relative risks (RR) and hazard ratios (HR), and continuous outcomes as mean differences (MD). Five trials were included. Four trials with 370 patients compared methotrexate with placebo or no intervention (three trials also added ursodeoxycholic acid to both groups); these trials had high risk of bias. There were no statistically significant effects of methotrexate on mortality (RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.66 to 2.64), mortality or liver transplantation combined, pruritus, fatigue, liver complications, liver biochemistry, liver histology, or adverse events. The pruritus score (MD -0.17, 95% CI -0.25 to -0.09) was significantly lower with methotrexate, while prothrombin time significantly worsened (MD 1.60 s, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.02). One trial with 85 patients compared methotrexate with colchicine and had low risk of bias; methotrexate did not significantly affect mortality, fatigue, liver biopsy findings, or adverse events, but significantly improved pruritus (MD -0.68, 95% CI -1.11 to -0.25), serum alkaline phosphatase (MD -0.41 U/L, 95% CI -0.70 to -0.12), and plasma immunoglobulin M (MD -0.47 mg/dL, 95% CI -0.74 to -0.20) compared with colchicine, while other outcomes showed no significant differences. Overall, methotrexate had no statistically significant effect on mortality or the need for liver transplantation in primary biliary cirrhosis, and although it may improve some laboratory and symptom outcomes, there is insufficient evidence to support its use for this condition.","Primary biliary cirrhosis is an uncommon chronic liver disease of unknown aetiology, affecting mostly women. It is characterised by progressive inflammation and destruction of the liver tissue, eventually progressing to liver cirrhosis and the need for liver transplantation. Methotrexate, a folic acid antagonist with immunosuppressive properties, has been used to treat patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. However, the evidence did not show a clear benefit of methotrexate on mortality or the need for liver transplantation in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. This review is based on five randomised trials; four comparing methotrexate with placebo, and one comparing methotrexate with colchicine. Methotrexate, compared with placebo, has no significant beneficial effect on mortality and the need for liver transplantation is not significantly reduced. The effects of methotrexate on pruritus, fatigue, clinical complications, liver biochemistry levels, liver histology, and adverse events were not significantly different from placebo. There may be some beneficial effect on pruritus score (ie, an objective measure of subjective feeling of pruritus), but we cannot recommend methotrexate for this indication only, taken into account possible adverse events. In the small trial comparing methotrexate versus colchicine, methotrexate seemed to work superior to colchicine, but it is not clear if this stems from the fact that methotrexate exerts beneficial effects as colchicine exerts harmful effects. In comparison with both placebo and colchicine, methotrexate was associated with large risks of mortality and adverse events, but the increase did not reach statistical significance.",1095,Methotrexate; primary biliary cirrhosis; immunosuppressive properties; liver transplantation; liver complications; liver biochemistry; liver histology; serum alkaline phosphatase; plasma immunoglobulin M; colchicine,Critically evaluate the claim that methotrexate improves pruritus scores in the context of primary biliary cirrhosis treatment.,"Design a follow-up study to address gaps identified in the methotrexate trials, considering biases and sample size.",Select all of the following that are fruits,What was the main aim of the study?,Summarize the overall conclusion about methotrexateâs efficacy from the document.,Pruritus improvement is one of the few significant outcomes and supports methotrexate use.; Improvements in pruritus are not sufficient to recommend methotrexate given possible adverse events.; Pruritus improvement could potentially mask more significant treatment failures.,Improvements in pruritus are not sufficient to recommend methotrexate given possible adverse events.; Pruritus improvement could potentially mask more significant treatment failures.,Increase sample size and ensure proper randomization to reduce potential biases.; Focus exclusively on male patients to evaluate gender-specific effects.; Include additional outcomes like quality of life and long-term survival.,Increase sample size and ensure proper randomization to reduce potential biases.; Include additional outcomes like quality of life and long-term survival.,dog; blue; grape,grape,To assess the effects of methotrexate compared to other treatments.; To explore new methods for treating liver diseases.; To compare the cost of different liver treatments.,To assess the effects of methotrexate compared to other treatments.,There is insufficient evidence to support its use for primary biliary cirrhosis.; It is recommended as a first-line treatment.; It has been proven as the most effective treatment.,There is insufficient evidence to support its use for primary biliary cirrhosis.
5ba9873edd59150001384069,finetuned_6,Biosimilar monoclonal antibodies for cancer treatment in adults,"Biosimilars are products that contain an approved biological medicine and are similar, but not identical, to the original version (the originator). In cancer, biosimilars have been developed from the monoclonal antibodies bevacizumab, rituximab, and trastuzumab, and they are now available for treating lung, colorectal, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and breast cancers. Because biological products cannot be made identically, it is important to evaluate the clinical effects of biosimilars compared with their originators to understand their benefits and harms. We evaluated the benefits and harms of biosimilar monoclonal antibodies versus their originators in adults with cancer. We searched major medical and clinical trial databases up to February 2024 for randomized controlled trials comparing biosimilars to originators. Standard Cochrane methods were used. The primary outcomes were progression-free survival, duration of response, overall survival, pathological complete response in breast cancer, serious adverse events, and health-related quality of life. We included 55 studies with 22,046 adults: 23 studies of bevacizumab involving 10,639 participants with colorectal or lung cancer, 17 studies of rituximab involving 4412 participants with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 15 studies of trastuzumab involving 6995 participants with breast cancer. Studies took place worldwide, were mostly multicentre, and all were funded by manufacturers. Participants ranged in age from 47 to 62 years, and the percentage of women ranged from 18% to 100%. Fifteen studies used non-inferiority designs and 40 used equivalence designs. Overall risk of bias was low, with most concerns related to incomplete outcome data and selective reporting. For bevacizumab in lung or colorectal cancer, progression-free survival was likely similar between biosimilars and originators, with equal numbers per 1000 at 12 months and a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.00. Duration of response and overall survival were also likely similar, and serious adverse events showed no important differences. Health-related quality of life was evaluated in only one colorectal cancer study and results were similar. Objective response and mortality were likely similar as well. For rituximab in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, biosimilars were likely similar to originators for progression-free survival, duration of response, overall survival, serious adverse events, objective response, and mortality. No studies reported quality of life. For trastuzumab in breast cancer, biosimilars were likely similar to originators for progression-free survival, duration of response, overall survival, serious adverse events, and objective response, and may be similar for pathological complete response. No studies reported quality of life. Across bevacizumab, rituximab, and trastuzumab, biosimilars were generally similar to their originators in progression-free survival, duration of response, overall survival, serious adverse events, objective response, and mortality. Evidence for pathological complete response (trastuzumab) and quality of life (bevacizumab) was limited. Overall, evidence certainty was moderate, with imprecision being the main reason for downgrading confidence.","Biological medicines used in cancer treatment are made from living organisms and work by killing cancer cells. Biosimilars are medicines that are similar to the original biological medicine, known as the originator. Although biosimilars have slightly different structures, they target cancer cells in the same way. Originator medicines, sometimes called reference or innovator medicines, receive approval before biosimilars. Unlike generic medicines, which are chemically derived and easier to replicate, originators and biosimilars are biological medicines, making it more difficult to create identical copies. However, biosimilars are often cheaper and could improve access to effective cancer treatment if they provide similar benefits and harms. We wanted to compare the benefits and harms of bevacizumab, rituximab, and trastuzumab biosimilars with their originators. Based on the input from five people with cancer, we considered several outcomes critical for clinical decisions: the length of time cancer does not grow or spread after treatment, the length of time people remain cancer-free, overall survival, the number of people whose breast cancer disappears in tissue removed during surgery, severe unwanted effects, and well-being. We also identified outcomes important for decision-making: the number of people whose cancer shrinks or disappears, death, and the time until cancer grows or spreads or until death. We searched for studies comparing biosimilars of bevacizumab, rituximab, or trastuzumab with the originators in people with lung, colorectal, non-Hodkin's lymphoma, and breast cancers, summarized the results, and rated our confidence in the evidence. We found 55 studies with 22,046 participants, including 10,639 receiving bevacizumab for advanced or metastatic lung cancer, 4412 receiving rituximab mainly for non-Hodkin's lymphoma, and 6995 receiving trastuzumab for advanced or metastatic breast cancer.

Receiving biosimilars or originator medicines led to similar results overall, and we are moderately confident that biosimilars are as effective as the originators in treating cancer.

66293cc1dcfaa310dd0f711b,static_1,Does yoga relieve cancer-related fatigue in people with cancer?,"Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is one of the most prevalent symptoms in individuals with cancer. Various types of exercise have shown beneficial effects. While previous systematic reviews suggest exercise may improve CRF and quality of life, evidence specifically about yoga's impact, as well as evidence on long-term effects, is limited. Previous syntheses offer promising but inconclusive findings on yoga's effectiveness. This review is one of a suite of five reviews exploring exercise for cancer-related fatigue.
To assess the effects of yoga versus no yoga on cancer-related fatigue in people with cancer: before, during, and after anticancer treatment; in the short, medium, and long term; and effects on quality of life (QoL), adverse events, depression, and anxiety.
We used CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, five other databases and two trials registers, together with reference checking, citation searching and contact with study authors to identify studies that are included in the review. The latest search date was October 2023.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing yoga to no yoga. We included studies in adults (aged 18 and older) with any type of cancer and anticancer therapy who received yoga before, during, or after anticancer therapy. We included trials evaluating at least one of the main outcomes (CRF or QoL). Yoga had to last for at least five sessions, and involve face-to-face instruction. We excluded trials with fewer than 20 participants randomised per group.
The outcomes of interest in this review are cancer-related fatigue (CRF), quality of life (QoL), adverse events, depression, and anxiety. We used standard methods expected by Cochrane. For analyses, we pooled results within the same period of outcome assessment (i.e. short, medium, and long term), and employed a random-effects model. We assessed risk of bias with the Cochrane risk of bias (RoB) 1 tool, and used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence.
We included 21 RCTs with 2041 people with cancer who received yoga during (13 studies) or after (eight studies) anticancer therapy; none examined yoga initiated before therapy. Here we present results on CRF and QoL; findings on adverse events, depression, and anxiety are in the full review. Yoga during anticancer therapy The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of yoga compared to no yoga on: short-term CRF (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.18 to 0.32; mean difference (MD) on Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI; lower values mean better outcome) of 0.16, 95% CI -0.41 to 0.71; 3 studies, 253 participants); medium-term CRF (MD on Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI; lower values mean better outcome) of -1.30, 95% CI -3.50 to 0.90; 1 study, 67 participants); and long-term CRF (MD 0.09 on BFI, 95% CI 1.16 to 0.98; 2 studies, 155 participants) (all very low-certainty evidence). Yoga may have a small beneficial effect or no effect compared to no yoga on short-term QoL (SMD 0.25, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.45; MD on Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30 (QLQ-C30; higher values mean better outcome) of 5.28, 95% CI 0.84 to 9.56; 4 studies, 374 participants) and medium-term QoL (MD on QLQ-C30 of 7.63, 95% CI 6.71 to 21.97; 2 studies, 151 participants), but the evidence is very uncertain (all very low-certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported long-term QoL. Yoga after anticancer therapy Yoga probably has a beneficial effect compared to no yoga on short-term CRF (SMD -0.26, 95% CI -0.42 to -0.09; MD 2.55, 95% CI 0.88 to 4.12; higher values mean better outcome; 5 studies, 602 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Yoga might have a beneficial effect or no effect compared to no yoga on medium-term CRF, but the evidence is very uncertain (MD 3.02, 95% CI -1.48 to 7.52; 1 study, 54 participants (higher values mean better outcome; very low-certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported long-term CRF. Yoga may have a small beneficial effect or no effect compared to no yoga on short-term QoL (SMD 0.19, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.47; MD -3.27, 95% CI -8.08 to 1.55; higher values mean better outcome; 4 studies, 275 participants) and medium term QoL (MD 7.06, 95% CI -1.38 to 15.50; 1 study, 54 participants; higher values mean better outcome), but the evidence is very uncertain (all very low-certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported long-term QoL. A key limitation of the review was the included studies' methodological constraints: participants' awareness of treatment assignments (yoga or control) potentially introduced bias. Additionally, sample sizes were too small to determine medium- and long-term effects conclusively. Further research is needed to evaluate the sustainability of yoga's impact on cancer-related fatigue, quality of life, and adverse events.
Our review provides uncertain evidence of the beneficial effects of yoga initiated during or after anticancer therapy compared to no yoga for people with cancer. Although there are indications supporting the use of yoga to address CRF, the uncertainty of the evidence underscores the need for caution in its implementation. Future RCTs should employ rigorous methodologies, enroll sufficient participants, and use appropriate controls.","Cancer-related fatigue is a feeling of extreme tiredness that lasts for a long time. It can be caused by cancer, cancer therapy, or both. Cancer-related fatigue affects the body and mood and makes it hard to perform regular activities. It is stronger than just being tired and does not go away by resting. Clinical guidelines recommend physical exercise to improve cancer-related fatigue. Physical exercise affects cancer-related fatigue by influencing biological and psychological processes, but it is unclear what types of exercise may be most beneficial. Yoga may reduce cancer-related fatigue and improve quality of life because it combines physical movement with breath control, mental focus, and body awareness. This review explored whether yoga improves cancer-related fatigue and quality of life in adults. We also examined whether any adverse events occurred in the studies. We investigated short-term (up to 12 weeks), medium-term (12 weeks to 6 months), and long-term (more than 6 months) effects. We searched for studies comparing yoga with no yoga in adults with any cancer, including yoga done before, during, or after anticancer therapy. Multiple types of yoga were included, such as Hatha and Dru yoga. We compared and summarised the results, assessed study quality, and considered differences based on type of yoga, cancer type, format of exercise (group vs individual; supervised vs unsupervised), and participant age. We found 21 studies involving 2041 participants with various cancers, mostly women with breast cancer. Yoga was initiated during anticancer therapy in 13 studies and after therapy in eight studies; no studies examined yoga before treatment. It is unclear whether yoga during anticancer therapy improves short, medium, or long-term cancer-related fatigue. Yoga during therapy may increase short- and medium-term quality of life, but the evidence is very uncertain, and no studies measured long-term quality of life. Only one study reported adverse events, so it is unclear whether yoga affects safety outcomes. No meaningful differences were found between different yoga types, training formats, supervision levels, or cancer types. Yoga after anticancer therapy probably reduces short-term cancer-related fatigue, but its effects on medium-term fatigue are unclear, and long-term fatigue was not measured. Yoga after therapy may slightly increase short and medium-term quality of life, but evidence is very uncertain, and long-term outcomes were not assessed. It is also unclear whether yoga after therapy leads to adverse events, and no differences were found between yoga types, cancer types, or age groups. Limitations include lack of blinding, which may influence results, and small or insufficiently long studies for several outcomes.

66293cc1dcfaa310dd0f711b,static_2,Degarelix for newly diagnosed advanced prostate cancer,"Degarelix is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist that leads to medical castration used to treat men with advanced or metastatic prostate cancer, or both. It is unclear how its effects compare to standard androgen suppression therapy. We assessed the effects of degarelix compared with standard androgen suppression therapy for men with advanced hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. We searched multiple databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, LILACS until September 2020), trial registries (until October 2020), and conference proceedings (until December 2020). We identified other potentially eligible trials by reference checking, citation searching, and contacting study authors. We included randomized controlled trials comparing degarelix with standard androgen suppression therapy for men with advanced prostate cancer. Three review authors independently classified studies and abstracted data from the included studies. The primary outcomes were overall survival and serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes were quality of life, cancer-specific survival, clinical progression, other adverse events, and biochemical progression. We used a random-effects model for meta-analyses and assessed the certainty of evidence for the main outcomes according to GRADE. We included 11 studies with a follow-up of between three and 14 months. We also identified five ongoing trials. Data to evaluate overall survival were not available. Degarelix may result in little to no difference in serious adverse events compared to standard androgen suppression therapy (risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 1.05; low-certainty evidence; 2750 participants). Based on 114 serious adverse events in the standard androgen suppression group, this corresponds to 23 fewer serious adverse events per 1000 participants (43 fewer to 6 more). We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations and imprecision. Degarelix likely results in little to no difference in quality of life assessed with a variety of validated questionnaires (standardized mean difference 0.06 higher, 95% CI 0.05 lower to 0.18 higher; moderate-certainty evidence; 2887 participants), with higher scores reflecting better quality of life. We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations. Data to evaluate cancer-specific survival were not available. The effects of degarelix on cardiovascular events are very uncertain (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.61; very low-certainty evidence; 80 participants). We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations, imprecision, and indirectness as this trial was conducted in a unique group of high-risk participants with pre-existing cardiovascular morbidities. Degarelix likely results in an increase in injection site pain (RR 15.68, 95% CI 7.41 to 33.17; moderate-certainty evidence; 2670 participants). Based on 30 participants per 1000 with injection site pain with standard androgen suppression therapy, this corresponds to 440 more injection site pains per 1000 participants (192 more to 965 more). We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations. We did not identify any relevant subgroup differences for different degarelix maintenance doses. We did not find trial evidence for overall survival or cancer-specific survival comparing degarelix to standard androgen suppression, but serious adverse events and quality of life may be similar between groups. The effects of degarelix on cardiovascular events are very uncertain as the only eligible study had limitations, was small with few events, and was conducted in a high-risk population. Degarelix likely results in an increase in injection site pain compared to standard androgen suppression therapy. Maximum follow-up of included studies was 14 months, which is short. There is a need for methodologically better designed and executed studies with long-term follow-up evaluating men with metastatic prostate cancer.","How does degarelix, a newer drug that treats prostate cancer by lowering male sex hormone levels, compare to existing medications for newly diagnosed advanced prostate cancer? There is no cure if prostate cancer has spread outside of the prostate gland to lymph nodes or to the bones. In such a situation, hormonal therapy that lowers levels of the male sex hormone testosterone can slow down cancer growth. Testosterone levels are regulated by complicated mechanisms that involve a hormone known as gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which is present in men at different levels at different times of the day. It is understood that giving men with prostate cancer high levels of medications that increase GnRH levels first raises testosterone levels, and then drops them to very low levels. These medications are commonly used to treat men with prostate cancer that has spread outside the prostate. Degarelix is a newer drug known as a GnRH antagonist, which blocks receptors in the brain and thereby lowers testosterone levels immediately. We included randomized controlled trials (studies in which participants are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) comparing degarelix and standard hormonal therapy in men with newly diagnosed advanced prostate cancer. The evidence is current to September 2020 for electronic databases, to October 2020 for trial registries, and to December 2020 for conference proceedings. We found 11 studies that were eligible for inclusion in the review, but none of these studies evaluated the risk of dying from any cause or dying from prostate cancer. There may be no difference between degarelix and standard hormonal therapy in serious unwanted effects and quality of life. The effects of degarelix on cardiovascular issues such as the risk of a heart attack or stroke are uncertain; while one study suggested that the risk may be reduced with degarelix, it had major issues, in particular that it was conducted in men at high risk for such problems. We found that degarelix therapy likely results in an increase in the occurrence of pain at the injection site. The certainty of evidence for the various outcomes ranged from moderate to very low. There is a need for additional, better designed studies to further understand the effects of degarelix for newly diagnosed advanced prostate cancer.",1024,Degarelix; gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist; androgen suppression therapy; metastatic prostate cancer; hormone-sensitive prostate cancer; overall survival; serious adverse events; quality of life; cancer-specific survival; cardiovascular events,How does the evidence regarding cardiovascular events influence the current understanding of degarelix compared to standard therapy?,What could improve the reliability of outcomes related to quality of life in future studies with degarelix?,Select all of the following that are fruits,How do the study's conclusions address the balance between serious adverse events and quality of life?,Which type of prostate cancer was the focus of the study comparing degarelix with standard therapy?,The evidence suggests a reduced risk with degarelix due to lower event rates in standard therapy.; The evidence is inconclusive due to study limitations and focus on high-risk populations.; The evidence supports degarelix as a preferable treatment for all patients because of fewer cardiac events.,The evidence is inconclusive due to study limitations and focus on high-risk populations.,Using a single standardized questionnaire for all studies.; Ensuring consistent data collection methods across studies.; Focusing on quality of life outcomes only in high-risk participant trials.,Ensuring consistent data collection methods across studies.,dog; blue; grape,grape,"The study concludes that there is little difference, suggesting similar benefit-risk profiles.; The conclusions indicate that degarelix has significantly fewer adverse events but similar quality of life.; It concludes that standard therapy provides better outcomes for quality of life but with more adverse events.","The study concludes that there is little difference, suggesting similar benefit-risk profiles.",Newly diagnosed advanced prostate cancer; Localized prostate cancer; Hormone-refractory prostate cancer,Newly diagnosed advanced prostate cancer
66293cc1dcfaa310dd0f711b,static_2,First-line treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer identified as being EGFR mutation positive,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation positive (M+) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is an important subtype of lung cancer comprising 10% to 15% of non-squamous tumours. This subtype is more common in women than men, is less associated with smoking, but occurs at a younger age than sporadic tumours.
To assess the clinical effectiveness of single-agent or combination EGFR therapies used in the first-line treatment of people with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR M+ NSCLC compared with other cytotoxic chemotherapy (CTX) agents used alone or in combination, or best supportive care (BSC). The primary outcomes were overall survival and progression-free survival. Secondary outcomes included response rate, symptom palliation, toxicity, and health-related quality of life.
We conducted electronic searches of the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2020, Issue 7), MEDLINE (1946 to 27th July 2020), Embase (1980 to 27th July 2020), and ISI Web of Science (1899 to 27th July 2020). We also searched the conference abstracts of the American Society for Clinical Oncology and the European Society for Medical Oncology (July 2020); Evidence Review Group submissions to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence; and the reference lists of retrieved articles.
Parallel-group randomised controlled trials comparing EGFR-targeted agents (alone or in combination with cytotoxic agents or BSC) with cytotoxic chemotherapy (single or doublet) or BSC in chemotherapy-naive patients with locally advanced or metastatic (stage IIIB or IV) EGFR M+ NSCLC unsuitable for treatment with curative intent.
Two review authors independently identified articles, extracted data, and carried out the 'Risk of bias' assessment. We conducted meta-analyses using a fixed-effect model unless there was substantial heterogeneity, in which case we also performed a random-effects analysis as a sensitivity analysis.
Twenty-two trials met the inclusion criteria. Ten of these exclusively recruited people with EGFR M+ NSCLC; the remainder recruited a mixed population and reported results for people with EGFR M+ NSCLC as subgroup analyses. The number of participants with EGFR M+ tumours totalled 3023, of whom approximately 2563 were of Asian origin. Overall survival (OS) data showed inconsistent results between the included trials that compared EGFR-targeted treatments against cytotoxic chemotherapy or placebo. Erlotinib was used in eight trials, gefitinib in nine trials, afatinib in two trials, cetuximab in two trials, and icotinib in one trial. The findings of FASTACT 2 suggested a clinical benefit for OS for participants treated with erlotinib plus cytotoxic chemotherapy when compared to cytotoxic chemotherapy alone, as did the Han 2017 trial for gefitinib plus cytotoxic chemotherapy, but both results were based on a small number of participants (n = 97 and 122, respectively). For progression-free survival (PFS), a pooled analysis of four trials showed evidence of clinical benefit for erlotinib compared with cytotoxic chemotherapy (hazard ratio (HR) 0.31; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25 to 0.39 ; 583 participants ; high-certainty evidence). A pooled analysis of two trials of gefitinib versus paclitaxel plus carboplatin showed evidence of clinical benefit for PFS for gefitinib (HR 0.39; 95% CI 0.32 to 0.48 ; 491 participants high-certainty evidence), and a pooled analysis of two trials of gefitinib versus pemetrexed plus carboplatin with pemetrexed maintenance also showed evidence of clinical benefit for PFS for gefitinib (HR 0.59; 95% CI 0.46 to 0.74, 371 participants ; moderate-certainty evidence). Afatinib showed evidence of clinical benefit for PFS when compared with chemotherapy in a pooled analysis of two trials (HR 0.42; 95% CI 0.34 to 0.53, 709 participants high-certainty evidence). All but one small trial showed a corresponding improvement in response rate with tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) compared to chemotherapy. Commonly reported grade 3/4 adverse events associated with afatinib, erlotinib, gefitinib and icotinib monotherapy were rash and diarrhoea. Myelosuppression was consistently worse in the chemotherapy arms; fatigue and anorexia were also associated with some chemotherapies. Seven trials reported on health-related quality of life and symptom improvement using different methodologies. For each of erlotinib, gefitinib, and afatinib, two trials showed improvement in one or more indices for the TKI compared to chemotherapy. The quality of evidence was high for the comparisons of erlotinib and gefitinib with cytotoxic chemotherapy and for the comparison of afatinib with cytotoxic chemotherapy.
Erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib and icotinib are all active agents in EGFR M+ NSCLC patients, and demonstrate an increased tumour response rate and prolonged PFS compared to cytotoxic chemotherapy. We found a beneficial effect of the TKI compared to cytotoxic chemotherapy in adverse effect and health-related quality of life. We found limited evidence for increased OS for the TKI when compared with standard chemotherapy, but the majority of the included trials allowed participants to switch treatments on disease progression, which will have a confounding effect on any OS analysis. Single agent-TKI remains the standard of care and the benefit of combining a TKI and chemotherapy remains uncertain as the evidence is based on small patient numbers. Cytotoxic chemotherapy is less effective in EGFR M+ NSCLC than erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib or icotinib and is associated with greater toxicity. There are no data supporting the use of monoclonal antibody therapy. Icotinib is not available outside China.","Lung cancer is the most common cancer in the world. It has often spread by the time it is diagnosed. Therefore, surgery is usually not possible and drug treatment, typically chemotherapy, is needed. The commonest type of lung cancer is non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Around 10% to 15% of people with NSCLC will have a specific kind of cancer known as epidermal growth factor receptor positive (EGFR M+), in which there are changes in the cancer cells to the genes controlling tumour growth. In this review, we looked at new treatments that can target EGFR M+ NSCLC to find out how well they work.
The purpose of this review was to find out whether people given treatments targeted at EGFR M+ NSCLC live longer and have a better health-related quality of life than people having standard chemotherapy.
We found 22 trials that looked at five different EGFR-targeted drugs and compared them with standard chemotherapy treatment: erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib, icotinib and the antibody cetuximab. We included trials reporting results up to 27 July 2020.
Our results showed that people given erlotinib, gefitinib,afatinib or icotinib have a longer time before the cancer progresses and experience fewer side effects than those people given standard chemotherapy. However, we could not be sure whether people given erlotinib, afatinib or icotinib live any longer than those given standard chemotherapy.

66293cc1dcfaa310dd0f711b,interactive_3,Bisphosphonates and denosumab for breast cancer,"Bone is the most common site of metastatic disease associated with breast cancer (BC). Bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, and novel targeted therapies such as denosumab inhibit other key bone metabolism pathways. We have studied these agents in both early breast cancer and advanced breast cancer settings. This is an update of the review originally published in 2002 and subsequently updated in 2005 and 2012.
To assess the effects of bisphosphonates and other bone agents in addition to anti-cancer treatment: (i) in women with early breast cancer (EBC); (ii) in women with advanced breast cancer without bone metastases (ABC); and (iii) in women with metastatic breast cancer and bone metastases (BCBM).
In this review update, we searched Cochrane Breast Cancer's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov on 19 September 2016.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing: (a) one treatment with a bisphosphonate/bone-acting agent with the same treatment without a bisphosphonate/bone-acting agent; (b) treatment with one bisphosphonate versus treatment with a different bisphosphonate; (c) treatment with a bisphosphonate versus another bone-acting agent of a different mechanism of action (e.g. denosumab); and (d) immediate treatment with a bisphosphonate/bone-acting agent versus delayed treatment of the same bisphosphonate/bone-acting agent.
Two review authors independently extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and quality of the evidence. The primary outcome measure was bone metastases for EBC and ABC, and a skeletal-related event (SRE) for BCBM. We derived risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and the meta-analyses used random-effects models. Secondary outcomes included overall survival and disease-free survival for EBC; we derived hazard ratios (HRs) for these time-to-event outcomes where possible. We collected toxicity and quality-of-life information. GRADE was used to assess the quality of evidence for the most important outcomes in each treatment setting.
We included 44 RCTs involving 37,302 women. In women with EBC, bisphosphonates were associated with a reduced risk of bone metastases compared to placebo/no bisphosphonate (RR 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75 to 0.99; P = 0.03, 11 studies; 15,005 women; moderate-quality evidence with no significant heterogeneity). Bisphosphonates provided an overall survival benefit with time-to-event data (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.99; P = 0.04; 9 studies; 13,949 women; high-quality evidence with evidence of heterogeneity). Subgroup analysis by menopausal status showed a survival benefit from bisphosphonates in postmenopausal women (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.90; P = 0.001; 4 studies; 6048 women; high-quality evidence with no evidence of heterogeneity) but no survival benefit for premenopausal women (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.22; P = 0.78; 2 studies; 3501 women; high-quality evidence with no heterogeneity). There was evidence of no effect of bisphosphonates on disease-free survival (HR 0.94, 95% 0.87 to 1.02; P = 0.13; 7 studies; 12,578 women; high-quality evidence with significant heterogeneity present) however subgroup analyses showed a disease-free survival benefit from bisphosphonates in postmenopausal women only (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.91; P < 0.001; 7 studies; 8314 women; high-quality evidence with no heterogeneity). Bisphosphonates did not significantly reduce the incidence of fractures when compared to placebo/no bisphosphonates (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.08, P = 0.13, 6 studies, 7602 women; moderate-quality evidence due to wide confidence intervals). We await mature overall survival and disease-free survival results for denosumab trials. In women with ABC without clinically evident bone metastases, there was no evidence of an effect of bisphosphonates on bone metastases (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.43; P = 0.86; 3 studies; 330 women; moderate-quality evidence with no heterogeneity) or overall survival (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.09; P = 0.28; 3 studies; 330 women; high-quality evidence with no heterogeneity) compared to placebo/no bisphosphonates however the confidence intervals were wide. One study reported a trend towards an extended period of time without a SRE with bisphosphonate compared to placebo (low-quality evidence). One study reported quality of life and there was no apparent difference in scores between bisphosphonate and placebo (moderate-quality evidence). In women with BCBM, bisphosphonates reduced the SRE risk by 14% (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.95; P = 0.003; 9 studies; 2810 women; high-quality evidence with evidence of heterogeneity) compared with placebo/no bisphosphonates. This benefit persisted when administering either intravenous or oral bisphosphonates versus placebo. Bisphosphonates delayed the median time to a SRE with a median ratio of 1.43 (95% CI 1.29 to 1.58; P < 0.00001; 9 studies; 2891 women; high-quality evidence with no heterogeneity) and reduced bone pain (in 6 out of 11 studies; moderate-quality evidence) compared to placebo/no bisphosphonate. Treatment with bisphosphonates did not appear to affect overall survival (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.11; P = 0.85; 7 studies; 1935 women; moderate-quality evidence with significant heterogeneity). Quality-of-life scores were slightly better with bisphosphonates than placebo at comparable time points (in three out of five studies; moderate-quality evidence) however scores decreased during the course of the studies. Denosumab reduced the risk of developing a SRE compared with bisphosphonates by 22% (RR 0.78, 0.72 to 0.85; P < 0.001; 3 studies, 2345 women). One study reported data on overall survival and observed no difference in survival between denosumab and bisphosphonate. Reported toxicities across all settings were generally mild. Osteonecrosis of the jaw was rare, occurring less than 0.5% in the adjuvant setting (high-quality evidence).
For women with EBC, bisphosphonates reduce the risk of bone metastases and provide an overall survival benefit compared to placebo or no bisphosphonates. There is preliminary evidence suggestive that bisphosphonates provide an overall survival and disease-free survival benefit in postmenopausal women only when compared to placebo or no bisphosphonate. This was not a planned subgroup for these early trials, and we await the completion of new large clinical trials assessing benefit for postmenopausal women. For women with BCBM, bisphosphonates reduce the risk of developing SREs, delay the median time to an SRE, and appear to reduce bone pain compared to placebo or no bisphosphonate.","Breast cancer may spread and recur in the bones. This may cause fractures, pain and high calcium in the bloodstream (known as complications).
Medicines for osteoporosis may prevent these complications and may help cure cancer by reducing cancer growth in the bone. These medicines are called 'bisphosphonates'. A newer type is called  denosumab. Bisphosphonates or denosumab are given in addition to other cancer treatment medications. These may be given along with chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, or radiotherapy.
The goal of bisphosphonates and denosumab differs based on the women's breast cancer status.
We asked three main questions:
1. For women with early breast cancer (EBC) , can bisphosphonates or denosumab reduce the risk of the cancer spreading to the bone? Will adding this medicine to anticancer treatments allow women to live longer (improve survival)?
2. For women with advanced breast cancer which does not appear to involve the bone (ABC) , can bisphosphonates reduce the risk of the cancer spreading to the bone and improve survival? Will bisphosphonates reduce complications and improve quality of life?
3. For women with metastatic breast cancer that has spread to the bone (BCBM), can bisphosphonates or denosumab reduce the risk of complication, and improve quality of life and survival?
We found 44 studies involving 37,302 participants. We included studies published by September 2016.
For women with EBC, we included 17 studies with 26,129 participants. The women's health was monitored for at least 12 months from the start of the study. Some studies monitored women for 10 years.
The studies tested different types of bisphosphonate drugs and denosumab, and different doses of these drugs. Some studies compared the drugs to no treatment. Some studies used oral medications. Other studies gave the medicine as an injection into a vein or under the skin.
Bisphosphonates probably lowered the risk of cancer spreading to the bone.
Bisphosphonates were found to improve survival, but the benefit in the whole group of women was small. Postmenopausal women had a benefit from bisphosphonates with improved survival and reduced risk of cancer returning. Premenopausal women did not have improved survival or reduced risk of the cancer returning. New studies that test bisphosphonates by the women's menopausal status are awaited.
We await the reporting of data on survival and other important outcomes from denosumab trials.
For women with ABC that had not spread to the bone, we included three studies enrolling 330 participants. All three studies compared oral bisphosphonates to no treatment.
Bisphosphonates did not reduce the risk of cancer spreading to the bone or improve survival. Very little information was available on complications and quality of life from only one study.
For women with BCBM, we included 24 studies enrolling 10,853 participants. Their health was monitored for at least 12 months. Some women were followed for 24 months. Most studies compared bisphosphonates to receiving no medication.
Bisphosphonates reduced complications (fractures and bone pain). Bisphosphonates did not appear to increase the length of time women survived. Quality of life scores were slightly better for women receiving bisphosphonates compared to similar women having no bisphosphonates.
Denosumab reduced the risk of complications compared to bisphosphonates in the three studies that collected these data. There was no benefit in survival from denosumab in the one study that collected data.
Side effects were uncommon and mild. There was a rare risk of damage to the jaw bone (osteonecrosis of the jaw).

66293cc1dcfaa310dd0f711b,interactive_4,Disease management programmes for heart failure,"Despite advances in treatment, the increasing and ageing population makes heart failure an important cause of morbidity and death worldwide. It is associated with high healthcare costs, partly driven by frequent hospital readmissions. Disease management interventions may help to manage people with heart failure in a more proactive, preventative way than drug therapy alone. This is the second update of a review published in 2005 and updated in 2012.
To compare the effects of different disease management interventions for heart failure (which are not purely educational in focus), with usual care, in terms of death, hospital readmissions, quality of life and cost-related outcomes.
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL for this review update on 9 January 2018 and two clinical trials registries on 4 July 2018. We applied no language restrictions.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with at least six months' follow-up, comparing disease management interventions to usual care for adults who had been admitted to hospital at least once with a diagnosis of heart failure. There were three main types of intervention: case management; clinic-based interventions; multidisciplinary interventions.
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Outcomes of interest were mortality due to heart failure, mortality due to any cause, hospital readmission for heart failure, hospital readmission for any cause, adverse effects, quality of life, costs and cost-effectiveness.
We found 22 new RCTs, so now include 47 RCTs (10,869 participants). Twenty-eight were case management interventions, seven were clinic-based models, nine were multidisciplinary interventions, and three could not be categorised as any of these. The included studies were predominantly in an older population, with most studies reporting a mean age of between 67 and 80 years. Seven RCTs were in upper-middle-income countries, the rest were in high-income countries. Only two multidisciplinary-intervention RCTs reported mortality due to heart failure. Pooled analysis gave a risk ratio (RR) of 0.46 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23 to 0.95), but the very low-quality evidence means we are uncertain of the effect on mortality due to heart failure. Based on this limited evidence, the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) is 12 (95% CI 9 to 126). Twenty-six case management RCTs reported all-cause mortality, with low-quality evidence indicating that these may reduce all-cause mortality (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.90; NNTB 25, 95% CI 17 to 54). We pooled all seven clinic-based studies, with low-quality evidence suggesting they may make little to no difference to all-cause mortality. Pooled analysis of eight multidisciplinary studies gave moderate-quality evidence that these probably reduce all-cause mortality (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.83; NNTB 17, 95% CI 12 to 32). We pooled data on heart failure readmissions from 12 case management studies. Moderate-quality evidence suggests that they probably reduce heart failure readmissions (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.78; NNTB 8, 95% CI 6 to 13). We were able to pool only two clinic-based studies, and the moderate-quality evidence suggested that there is probably little or no difference in heart failure readmissions between clinic-based interventions and usual care (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.18). Pooled analysis of five multidisciplinary interventions gave low-quality evidence that these may reduce the risk of heart failure readmissions (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.92; NNTB 11, 95% CI 7 to 44). Meta-analysis of 14 RCTs gave moderate-quality evidence that case management probably slightly reduces all-cause readmissions (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.01); a decrease from 491 to 451 in 1000 people (95% CI 407 to 495). Pooling four clinic-based RCTs gave low-quality and somewhat heterogeneous evidence that these may result in little or no difference in all-cause readmissions (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.12). Low-quality evidence from five RCTs indicated that multidisciplinary interventions may slightly reduce all-cause readmissions (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.01); a decrease from 450 to 383 in 1000 people (95% CI 320 to 455). Neither case management nor clinic-based intervention RCTs reported adverse effects. Two multidisciplinary interventions reported that no adverse events occurred. GRADE assessment of moderate quality suggested that there may be little or no difference in adverse effects between multidisciplinary interventions and usual care. Quality of life was generally poorly reported, with high attrition. Low-quality evidence means we are uncertain about the effect of case management and multidisciplinary interventions on quality of life. Four clinic-based studies reported quality of life but we could not pool them due to differences in reporting. Low-quality evidence indicates that clinic-based interventions may result in little or no difference in quality of life. Four case management programmes had cost-effectiveness analyses, and seven reported cost data. Low-quality evidence indicates that these may reduce costs and may be cost-effective. Two clinic-based studies reported cost savings. Low-quality evidence indicates that clinic-based interventions may reduce costs slightly. Low-quality data from one multidisciplinary intervention suggested this may be cost-effective from a societal perspective but less so from a health-services perspective.
We found limited evidence for the effect of disease management programmes on mortality due to heart failure, with few studies reporting this outcome. Case management may reduce all-cause mortality, and multidisciplinary interventions probably also reduce all-cause mortality, but clinic-based interventions had little or no effect on all-cause mortality. Readmissions due to heart failure or any cause were probably reduced by case-management interventions. Clinic-based interventions probably make little or no difference to heart failure readmissions and may result in little or no difference in readmissions for any cause. Multidisciplinary interventions may reduce the risk of readmission for heart failure or for any cause. There was a lack of evidence for adverse effects, and conclusions on quality of life remain uncertain due to poor-quality data. Variations in study location and time of occurrence hamper attempts to review costs and cost-effectiveness. The potential to improve quality of life is an important consideration but remains poorly reported. Improved reporting in future trials would strengthen the evidence for this patient-relevant outcome.","We investigated the effects of disease management programmes on death from heart failure or from any cause, hospital readmissions for heart failure or for any cause, adverse effects, quality of life and cost-effectiveness, in adults who had been admitted to hospital at least once for heart failure. Heart failure affects a person's quality of life, is a frequent cause of hospital admission and has a high risk of death. Traditional drug therapy is the main treatment, but people may benefit from additional support from disease management programmes that aim to provide ongoing support rather than crisis management. Such programmes may be run by specialist nurses, as clinic-based interventions, or by multidisciplinary teams. Community-based support of this kind could help to keep people out of hospital by improving day-to-day symptom management and providing an early warning system for changes requiring medical attention. We conducted a comprehensive search for all studies investigating heart failure-specific disease management interventions for adults who had been admitted to hospital at least once for heart failure (evidence current to 9 January 2018). We included 47 studies, with a total of 10,869 participants. Twenty-eight studies were case management interventions, seven were clinic-based models, nine were multidisciplinary interventions and three could not be categorised as any of these. The average age of the people in most of the studies was between 67 and 80 years old, although 10 studies had younger participants on average, and one included mostly very elderly people. Most trials were in Europe and North America, but others took place in China, Taiwan, Iran and Japan. We found limited evidence for an effect on mortality due to heart failure, as few studies reported this outcome. There was some evidence that case management may reduce all-cause mortality, and multidisciplinary interventions probably do, but clinic-based studies appeared to have little or no effect on this. Readmissions due to heart failure and due to any cause were probably reduced by case management interventions. Clinic-based interventions probably make little or no difference to heart failure readmissions and may result in little or no difference in readmissions for any cause. Multidisciplinary interventions may reduce the risk of readmission for heart failure or any cause. Only two studies mentioned adverse events, both stating that none occurred. Many studies measured quality of life, but it is difficult to draw conclusions for any effect because they tended to report this in different ways and did not report it for all their participants. Data on costs and cost-effectiveness were limited, but indicated a slight benefit of disease management programmes, mostly due to reduced hospital readmission costs. The quality of evidence was very low for mortality due to heart failure, low to moderate for all-cause mortality, low to moderate for heart failure readmissions, and all-cause readmissions, moderate for adverse events (where available), low to very low for quality of life and low to moderate for costs. The quality of evidence is important as it impacts on how certain we can be in the effect of the intervention on the outcomes we are interested in. For example, if the evidence is of very low quality, we cannot be certain of the intervention's effect.",1033,Disease management interventions; Heart failure; Hospital readmissions; All-cause mortality; Case management interventions; Multidisciplinary interventions; Clinic-based interventions; Quality of life; Adverse effects; Mortality due to heart failure,How do case management interventions compare with clinic-based interventions in terms of reducing all-cause mortality?,What were the primary motivations for exploring disease management programs for heart failure?,Select all of the following that are colors,How does the study describe the effect of multidisciplinary interventions on all-cause mortality?,Identify the populations studied in the trials included in the research.,Case management may reduce all-cause mortality.; Clinic-based interventions showed significant reductions in all-cause mortality.; Both interventions had the same effect on all-cause mortality.,Case management may reduce all-cause mortality.,To provide ongoing support rather than crisis management; To replace traditional drug therapy entirely; To reduce hospital readmissions and improve quality of life,To provide ongoing support rather than crisis management; To reduce hospital readmissions and improve quality of life,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,They probably reduce all-cause mortality; They have no impact on all-cause mortality; They increase all-cause mortality,They probably reduce all-cause mortality,Adults admitted to hospital at least once for heart failure; Children with congenital heart conditions; Elderly patients in nursing homes,Adults admitted to hospital at least once for heart failure
66293cc1dcfaa310dd0f711b,interactive_4,Treatment options for people with recurrent and progressive glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly malignant brain tumour that almost always progresses or recurs after standard first-line treatment, and there is no consensus on the most effective therapy once the disease returns. This review evaluated available treatments for first and later recurrence in people previously treated with the standard Stupp protocol and included a brief economic commentary. Searches of major medical databases up to December 2019 identified 42 eligible studies (34 randomised trials and 8 non-randomised studies) involving 5236 participants. Most randomised trials had low risk of bias, while non-randomised studies had high risk of bias. Treatments included chemotherapy, re-operation, re-irradiation, and novel therapies used alone or in combination. For first recurrence, 11 treatments contributed to the overall survival network analysis and eight to the progression-free survival analysis, with lomustine (LOM/CCNU) used as the reference treatment. No included studies in the network meta-analysis evaluated surgery, re-irradiation, PCV, temozolomide (TMZ) rechallenge, or best supportive care, and quality-of-life data were sparse. Median overall survival ranged from 5.5 to 12.6 months and median progression-free survival from 1.5 to 4.2 months. No high-certainty evidence showed any treatment improved survival compared with lomustine. Bevacizumab plus lomustine probably resulted in little or no difference in survival compared with lomustine alone, though it may improve progression-free survival. Bevacizumab alone may offer little or no survival benefit, and evidence remains uncertain. Regorafenib may improve overall survival compared with lomustine but evidence certainty was low. Temozolomide plus Depatux-M (ABT414) may improve survival compared with lomustine or bevacizumab, possibly driven by the temozolomide component, but additional evidence is needed. Fotemustine may have similar effects to lomustine. Evidence for bevacizumab plus irinotecan was very uncertain, and it likely offers little benefit over bevacizumab alone. Ranking analyses placed fotemustine first, followed by bevacizumab plus lomustine, lomustine alone, bevacizumab plus irinotecan, and bevacizumab alone, though ranking does not reflect evidence certainty. Three studies examining re-operation suggested it may extend survival in carefully selected patients. One early-phase study suggested a potential role for a cannabinoid plus temozolomide. Evidence for treatment of second or later recurrence was limited; some heterogeneous studies suggested radiotherapy with or without bevacizumab may improve survival, while tumour-treating fields showed little difference compared with physician's choice. No reliable evidence was found for best supportive care. Severe adverse events were significantly more common with bevacizumab plus lomustine than with lomustine alone and were similarly high with cediranib plus lomustine. Lomustine alone had the lowest rate of severe adverse events, followed by regorafenib. Combinations that added novel agents to bevacizumab generally increased toxicity. Overall, combination treatments for first recurrence did not improve survival compared with lomustine monotherapy and were often associated with more severe adverse events. Re-operation and re-irradiation may benefit selected individuals. Evidence for later recurrences remains sparse, and more high-quality research is needed.","Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a very aggressive brain tumour that often continues to grow even after surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, and almost always comes back. Many different treatments have been tested for tumour progression or recurrence, but there is no agreement on which option is best. This review evaluated treatments for people whose GBM progressed or recurred after receiving standard initial care. A total of 42 studies involving 5236 people were included. Treatments examined included chemotherapy, re-operation, re-irradiation, and newer therapies used alone or in combination. For first recurrence, none of the treatments showed clear evidence of being better than lomustine (CCNU). Adding bevacizumab to lomustine did not improve overall survival, and most other agents either had uncertain benefits or did not improve outcomes. Several commonly used treatments such as PCV and temozolomide re-challenge were not represented in the available evidence. Limited evidence suggested that a second surgery, with or without additional therapies, may offer some survival benefit in selected individuals. For second or later recurrence, evidence was too limited for statistical analysis, but radiotherapy with or without bevacizumab might offer some benefit, though this is uncertain. Serious side effects occurred with many treatments, and combining bevacizumab with lomustine resulted in more severe adverse events than lomustine alone. Overall, lomustine appears to be the most effective chemotherapy option for first recurrence, and other combination therapies generally carried higher risks without clear benefits. A second surgery or radiotherapy may be helpful for some individuals. For later recurrences, evidence is sparse and uncertain. More research is needed, especially for commonly used treatments not evaluated in the included studies.",1022,Glioblastoma; Stupp protocol; lomustine; progression-free survival; overall survival; bevacizumab; temozolomide; Fotemustine; re-irradiation; severe adverse events,In what ways do the reviewed treatments reflect the challenges in managing GBM recurrences?,What was the main purpose of the study?,Select all of the following that are colors,Which treatment appeared most effective for first recurrence of GBM?,Describe how combination therapies for GBM first recurrence impacted outcomes.,Lack of treatments with clear survival benefits; Abundance of high-certainty evidence; Uniformity in patient response to treatments,Lack of treatments with clear survival benefits,To establish a new treatment protocol for GBM.; To evaluate treatments for GBM recurrence.; To prove the effectiveness of surgery for GBM.,To evaluate treatments for GBM recurrence.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Bevacizumab plus lomustine.; Lomustine alone.; Regorafenib.,Lomustine alone.,Combination therapies improved overall survival.; Combination therapies often increased severe adverse events.; Combination therapies provided clear benefits over lomustine.,Combination therapies often increased severe adverse events.
66293cc1dcfaa310dd0f711b,finetuned_5,Coenzyme Q10 for heart failure,"Coenzyme Q10, or ubiquinone, is a non-prescription nutritional supplement. It is a fat-soluble molecule that acts as an electron carrier in mitochondria, and as a coenzyme for mitochondrial enzymes. Coenzyme Q10 deficiency may be associated with a multitude of diseases, including heart failure. The severity of heart failure correlates with the severity of coenzyme Q10 deficiency. Emerging data suggest that the harmful effects of reactive oxygen species are increased in people with heart failure, and coenzyme Q10 may help to reduce these toxic effects because of its antioxidant activity. Coenzyme Q10 may also have a role in stabilising myocardial calcium-dependent ion channels, and in preventing the consumption of metabolites essential for adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) synthesis. Coenzyme Q10, although not a primary recommended treatment, could be beneficial to people with heart failure. Several randomised controlled trials have compared coenzyme Q10 to other therapeutic modalities, but no systematic review of existing randomised trials was conducted prior to the original version of this Cochrane Review, in 2014. To review the safety and efficacy of coenzyme Q10 in heart failure. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL Plus, and AMED on 16 October 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov on 16 July 2020, and the ISRCTN Registry on 11 November 2019. We applied no language restrictions. We included randomised controlled trials of either parallel or cross-over design that assessed the beneficial and harmful effects of coenzyme Q10 in people with heart failure. When we identified cross-over studies, we considered data only from the first phase. We used standard Cochrane methods, assessed study risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool, and GRADE methods to assess the quality of the evidence. For dichotomous data, we calculated the risk ratio (RR); for continuous data, the mean difference (MD), both with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where appropriate data were available, we conducted meta-analysis. When meta-analysis was not possible, we wrote a narrative synthesis. We provided a PRISMA flow chart to show the flow of study selection. We included eleven studies, with 1573 participants, comparing coenzyme Q10 to placebo or conventional therapy (control). In the majority of the studies, sample size was relatively small. There were important differences among studies in daily coenzyme Q10 dose, follow-up period, and the measures of treatment effect. All studies had unclear, or high risk of bias, or both, in one or more bias domains. We were only able to conduct meta-analysis for some of the outcomes. None of the included trials considered quality of life, measured on a validated scale, exercise variables (exercise haemodynamics), or cost-effectiveness. Coenzyme Q10 probably reduces the risk of all-cause mortality more than control (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.95; 1 study, 420 participants; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 13.3; moderate-quality evidence). There was low-quality evidence of inconclusive results between the coenzyme Q10 and control groups for the risk of myocardial infarction (RR 1.62, 95% CI 0.27 to 9.59; 1 study, 420 participants), and stroke (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.48; 1 study, 420 participants). Coenzyme Q10 probably reduces hospitalisation related to heart failure (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.78; 2 studies, 1061 participants; NNTB 9.7; moderate-quality evidence). Very low-quality evidence suggests that coenzyme Q10 may improve the left ventricular ejection fraction (MD 1.77, 95% CI 0.09 to 3.44; 7 studies, 650 participants), but the results are inconclusive for exercise capacity (MD 48.23, 95% CI -24.75 to 121.20; 3 studies, 91 participants); and the risk of developing adverse events (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.10; 2 studies, 568 participants). We downgraded the quality of the evidence mainly due to high risk of bias and imprecision. The included studies provide moderate-quality evidence that coenzyme Q10 probably reduces all-cause mortality and hospitalisation for heart failure. There is low-quality evidence of inconclusive results as to whether coenzyme Q10 has an effect on the risk of myocardial infarction, or stroke. Because of very low-quality evidence, it is very uncertain whether coenzyme Q10 has an effect on either left ventricular ejection fraction or exercise capacity. There is low-quality evidence that coenzyme Q10 may increase the risk of adverse effects, or have little to no difference. There is currently no convincing evidence to support or refute the use of coenzyme Q10 for heart failure. Future trials are needed to confirm our findings.","Heart failure is a term used to describe the state that develops when the heart cannot maintain adequate cardiac output, or can do so only at the expense of overfilling the heart chambers. People with heart failure commonly experience a relapsing and remitting disease course, with periods of stability and episodes of decompensation (failure to cope with heart damage), leading to worsening symptoms that necessitate hospitalisation.
Treatment options for heart failure range from drugs to heart transplantation, with each having its own limitations. Coenzyme Q10 (or ubiquinone) has been suggested as a treatment option in some trials. Coenzyme Q10 is a non-prescription nutritional supplement. It is a fat-soluble molecule that has a role in energy production within the cells of the body. It may also have antioxidant properties.
Low levels of coenzyme Q10 may be related to the severity of heart failure. Coenzyme Q10 has been found in all tissues and organs in the body, with the highest concentrations in the heart. Emerging data have suggested that the harmful effects of reactive oxygen species (unstable molecules that contains oxygen and easily reacts with other molecules) are increased in people with heart failure. Because of its antioxidant activity, coenzyme Q10 may help to reduce these toxic effects, which damage the components of the cardiac cells, and disrupt cellular signalling. Coenzyme Q10 plays an important role in conducting signals within the heart muscle and in generating energy.The concentration of coenzyme Q10 has been inversely related to the severity of heart failure. Supplementation with coenzyme Q10 may improve heart failure. Coenzyme Q10 is sometimes used because it is thought to have an acceptable safety profile, with no significant side effects.
We conducted this review to assess the available evidence on the effects of coenzyme Q10 in people with heart failure. We included 11 randomised controlled trials, involving 1573 participants. They were relatively small, and followed up participants for a relatively short period of time. The analyses show that coenzyme Q10 probably reduces the risk of mortality from all causes, and hospitalisations due to heart failure. It may result in increased, or little or no difference in the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, or adverse events. The effect of coenzyme Q10 on cardiac function and symptom improvement is uncertain.
The evidence, current to October 2020, is of a moderate quality at best, because of the high risk of bias in some of the included studies and the absence of precise and consistent results.

66293cc1dcfaa310dd0f711b,finetuned_6,"Thymic peptides for treatment of cancer patients in addition to chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or both","Purified thymus extracts (pTE) and synthetic thymic peptides (sTP) are thought to enhance the immune system of cancer patients to help fight tumour growth and reduce infections caused by disease-related or treatment-related immunosuppression. This review evaluated the effectiveness of pTE and sTP for cancer management. Researchers searched major medical databases up to February 2010 for randomized trials in adult cancer patients where pTE or sTP were added to chemotherapy or radiotherapy and compared with the same regimen alone or with placebo. Data were independently extracted by two authors, and odds ratios were calculated for overall survival, disease-free survival, tumour response, and adverse effects. A random-effects model was used. Twenty-six trials involving 2736 patients were identified: 20 trials investigated pTE (thymostimulin or thymosin fraction 5) and six investigated sTP (thymopentin or thymosin ?1). Twenty-one trials reported overall survival, six reported disease-free survival, 14 reported tumour response, nine reported adverse effects, and 10 reported safety. Adding pTE showed no benefit for overall survival (RR 1.00), disease-free survival (RR 0.97), or tumour response (RR 1.07), with moderate to high heterogeneity. For thymosin ?1, the pooled RR for overall survival was 1.21 and for disease-free survival was 3.37, though neither result reached statistical significance. pTE reduced the risk of severe infectious complications (RR 0.54), and thymostimulin showed a non-significant trend toward reduced severe neutropenia. Both pTE and sTP were generally well tolerated. Many trials had at least moderate risk of bias. Overall, there is no clear evidence that adding pTE to cancer treatment improves survival or tumour response, although thymosin ?1 showed a possible trend toward benefit. There is preliminary evidence that pTE may reduce severe infectious complications during chemotherapy or radiotherapy.","The immune system plays a key role in the body's own defences against cancer cells. The thymus gland plays a central part in this and modifies T-cells, a subset of lymphocytes. Studies with thymic peptides have shown a variety of effects on the immune system. There are two groups of thymic peptides available for use in treatment: purified extracts from animal (mostly calf) thymus glands and synthetically produced thymus gland peptides.
This review aims to answer the question whether having thymic peptides can improve the response to and tolerability of standard chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or combined treatment. Further questions are whether the peptides inhibit or reduce the progression and recurrence of disease, whether they prolong the life of cancer patients and whether quality of life is improved. This review looked at the evidence from 26 clinical trials with a total of 2736 adult cancer patients. Many of the trials were small and of moderate quality. Only three studies were less than 10 years old. Thymosin ?1 is a synthetic peptide that shows some promise as a treatment option for patients with metastatic melanoma when used in addition to chemotherapy. Severe problems occur during chemotherapy and radiotherapy due to low white blood cell counts and infections. These were reduced by using purified thymus extracts. However, the use of purified thymus extracts should be investigated more thoroughly before the extracts are used routinely in patients. The findings were not conclusive and caution is advised.

66293cc1dcfaa310dd0f711b,finetuned_6,Selenium for preventing cancer,"This review is the third update of the Cochrane review ""Selenium for preventing cancer"". Selenium is a naturally occurring element with both nutritional and toxicological properties. Higher selenium exposure and selenium supplements have been suggested to protect against several types of cancer.
To gather and present evidence needed to address two research questions: 1. What is the aetiological relationship between selenium exposure and cancer risk in humans? 2. Describe the efficacy of selenium supplementation for cancer prevention in humans.
We updated electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 2), MEDLINE (Ovid, 2013 to January 2017, week 4), and Embase (2013 to 2017, week 6), as well as searches of clinical trial registries.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and longitudinal observational studies that enrolled adult participants.
We performed random-effects (RE) meta-analyses when two or more RCTs were available for a specific outcome. We conducted RE meta-analyses when five or more observational studies were available for a specific outcome. We assessed risk of bias in RCTs and in observational studies using Cochrane's risk assessment tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, respectively. We considered in the primary analysis data pooled from RCTs with low risk of bias. We assessed the certainty of evidence by using the GRADE approach.
We included 83 studies in this updated review: two additional RCTs (10 in total) and a few additional trial reports for previously included studies. RCTs involved 27,232 participants allocated to either selenium supplements or placebo. For analyses of RCTs with low risk of bias, the summary risk ratio (RR) for any cancer incidence was 1.01 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.10; 3 studies, 19,475 participants; high-certainty evidence). The RR for estimated cancer mortality was 1.02 (95% CI 0.80 to 1.30; 1 study, 17,448 participants). For the most frequently investigated site-specific cancers, investigators provided little evidence of any effect of selenium supplementation. Two RCTs with 19,009 participants indicated that colorectal cancer was unaffected by selenium administration (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.43), as were non-melanoma skin cancer (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.30 to 4.42; 2 studies, 2027 participants), lung cancer (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.50; 2 studies, 19,009 participants), breast cancer (RR 2.04, 95% CI 0.44 to 9.55; 1 study, 802 participants), bladder cancer (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.52; 2 studies, 19,009 participants), and prostate cancer (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.14; 4 studies, 18,942 participants). Certainty of the evidence was high for all of these cancer sites, except for breast cancer, which was of moderate certainty owing to imprecision, and non-melanoma skin cancer, which we judged as moderate certainty owing to high heterogeneity. RCTs with low risk of bias suggested increased melanoma risk. Results for most outcomes were similar when we included all RCTs in the meta-analysis, regardless of risk of bias. Selenium supplementation did not reduce overall cancer incidence (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.14; 5 studies, 21,860 participants) nor mortality (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.32; 2 studies, 18,698 participants). Summary RRs for site-specific cancers showed limited changes compared with estimates from high-quality studies alone, except for liver cancer, for which results were reversed. In the largest trial, the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Trial, selenium supplementation increased risks of alopecia and dermatitis, and for participants with highest background selenium status, supplementation also increased risk of high-grade prostate cancer. RCTs showed a slightly increased risk of type 2 diabetes associated with supplementation. A hypothesis generated by the Nutritional Prevention of Cancer Trial - that individuals with low blood selenium levels could reduce their risk of cancer (particularly prostate cancer) by increasing selenium intake - has not been confirmed. As RCT participants have been overwhelmingly male (88%), we could not assess the potential influence of sex or gender. We included 15 additional observational cohort studies (70 in total; over 2,360,000 participants). We found that lower cancer incidence (summary odds ratio (OR) 0.72, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.93; 7 studies, 76,239 participants) and lower cancer mortality (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.97; 7 studies, 183,863 participants) were associated with the highest category of selenium exposure compared with the lowest. Cancer incidence was lower in men (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.14, 4 studies, 29,365 men) than in women (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.77, 2 studies, 18,244 women). Data show a decrease in risk of site-specific cancers for stomach, colorectal, lung, breast, bladder, and prostate cancers. However, these studies have major weaknesses due to study design, exposure misclassification, and potential unmeasured confounding due to lifestyle or nutritional factors covarying with selenium exposure beyond those taken into account in multi-variable analyses. In addition, no evidence of a dose-response relation between selenium status and cancer risk emerged. Certainty of evidence was very low for each outcome. Some studies suggested that genetic factors might modify the relation between selenium and cancer risk - an issue that merits further investigation.
Well-designed and well-conducted RCTs have shown no beneficial effect of selenium supplements in reducing cancer risk (high certainty of evidence). Some RCTs have raised concerns by reporting a higher incidence of high-grade prostate cancer and type 2 diabetes in participants with selenium supplementation. No clear evidence of an influence of baseline participant selenium status on outcomes has emerged in these studies. Observational longitudinal studies have shown an inverse association between selenium exposure and risk of some cancer types, but null and direct relations have also been reported, and no systematic pattern suggesting dose-response relations has emerged. These studies suffer from limitations inherent to the observational design, including exposure misclassification and unmeasured confounding. Overall, there is no evidence to suggest that increasing selenium intake through diet or supplementation prevents cancer in humans. However, more research is needed to assess whether selenium may modify the risk of cancer in individuals with a specific genetic background or nutritional status, and to investigate possible differential effects of various forms of selenium.","We reviewed the evidence investigating the relation between selenium intake and cancer prevention. This review updates the most recent Cochrane review on this topic (Vinceti 2014, which was an update of Dennert 2011.
Selenium is a naturally occurring element that individuals are exposed to mainly through food consumption, although exposure can also occur through air, drinking water, and dietary supplements. Small amounts of selenium are essential for certain biological functions in humans, but slightly higher amounts can pose a toxicity risk, making selenium an element with a narrow, but as yet not well-defined, safe range of exposure. Selenium occurs in many different chemical forms with different biological activity. From the late 1960s, a few observational studies reported that people with high levels of selenium in their diet or in their body tissues had lower risk of cancer, and some laboratory studies showed that selenium could inhibit the growth of cancer cells. This led to widespread interest in selenium supplements and claims that taking such supplements could prevent cancer. Since that time, many more observational studies have been conducted to compare cancer rates among individuals with high and low selenium exposure. More recently, several randomised controlled trials designed to assess whether selenium supplementation can prevent cancer have been carried out. These trials played a major role in enhancing our understanding of the relation between selenium and cancer risk as a result of their stronger study design as compared with observational studies. The most recent trials in particular have shown high methodological quality and statistical power. Several trials focused on whether selenium could prevent prostate cancer.
This review includes 10 trials in which adults were randomly assigned to receive selenium supplements or placebo, and 70 observational studies in which adults were followed over time to determine whether their baseline selenium status was associated with their risk of cancer. The evidence is current to January 2017.
All of the high-quality randomised trials reported no effect of selenium on reducing overall risk of cancer or risk of particular cancers, including the most investigated outcome - prostate cancer. Some trials unexpectedly suggested that selenium may increase risks of high-grade prostate cancer, type 2 diabetes, and dermatological abnormalities.
Observational studies have yielded inconsistent evidence of a possible effect of selenium exposure on cancer risk, with no evidence of a dose-response relation. When we pooled results of these studies, overall they suggested an inverse relation between cancer exposure and subsequent incidence of any cancer or some specific cancers, such as colon and prostate cancer. However, observational studies have major weaknesses. The selenium exposure status of participants could have been misclassified owing to limitations of the indicators of selenium exposure used, as well as to uncertainty regarding the particular selenium species contributing to overall exposure. In addition, unmeasured confounding from lifestyle or nutritional factors - a major and well-known source of bias in nutritional epidemiology studies of observational design - could have been present. Therefore, the internal validity of these studies is limited.
Currently, the hypothesis that increasing selenium intake may reduce cancer risk is not supported by epidemiological evidence. Additional research is needed to assess whether selenium may affect the risk of cancer in individuals with specific genetic backgrounds or nutritional status, and to determine how the various chemical forms of selenium compounds may have different effects on cancer risk.",1025,Selenium; cancer incidence; cancer mortality; site-specific cancers; melanoma; high-grade prostate cancer; type 2 diabetes; genetic factors,How do observational studies and randomised trials differ in their findings on selenium exposure and cancer?,Critically judge the hypothesis that increasing selenium intake reduces cancer risk.,Select all of the following that are colors,What was the primary aim of the reviewed study?,What inference about selenium supplementation and prostate cancer was made in the trials?,"Observational studies suggest an inverse relationship, while randomised trials show no effect.; Both observational studies and randomised trials suggest selenium reduces cancer risk.; Observational studies show a direct relationship, but randomised trials confirm no effect.","Observational studies suggest an inverse relationship, while randomised trials show no effect.",The hypothesis is supported by high-quality randomised trials.; The hypothesis is not supported by epidemiological evidence.; The hypothesis remains untested due to lack of trials.,The hypothesis is not supported by epidemiological evidence.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,To determine the nutritional benefits of selenium for cancer prevention.; To investigate the relationship between selenium intake and cancer prevention.; To compare selenium with other nutritional supplements.,To investigate the relationship between selenium intake and cancer prevention.,Selenium supplementation might increase the risk of high-grade prostate cancer.; Selenium supplementation definitely prevents prostate cancer.; Selenium has no impact on prostate cancer risk.,Selenium supplementation might increase the risk of high-grade prostate cancer.
63d84be2c9a21026d442e728,static_1,Degarelix for newly diagnosed advanced prostate cancer,"Degarelix is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist that leads to medical castration used to treat men with advanced or metastatic prostate cancer, or both. It is unclear how its effects compare to standard androgen suppression therapy. We assessed the effects of degarelix compared with standard androgen suppression therapy for men with advanced hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. We searched multiple databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, LILACS until September 2020), trial registries (until October 2020), and conference proceedings (until December 2020). We identified other potentially eligible trials by reference checking, citation searching, and contacting study authors. We included randomized controlled trials comparing degarelix with standard androgen suppression therapy for men with advanced prostate cancer. Three review authors independently classified studies and abstracted data from the included studies. The primary outcomes were overall survival and serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes were quality of life, cancer-specific survival, clinical progression, other adverse events, and biochemical progression. We used a random-effects model for meta-analyses and assessed the certainty of evidence for the main outcomes according to GRADE. We included 11 studies with a follow-up of between three and 14 months. We also identified five ongoing trials. Data to evaluate overall survival were not available. Degarelix may result in little to no difference in serious adverse events compared to standard androgen suppression therapy (risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 1.05; low-certainty evidence; 2750 participants). Based on 114 serious adverse events in the standard androgen suppression group, this corresponds to 23 fewer serious adverse events per 1000 participants (43 fewer to 6 more). We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations and imprecision. Degarelix likely results in little to no difference in quality of life assessed with a variety of validated questionnaires (standardized mean difference 0.06 higher, 95% CI 0.05 lower to 0.18 higher; moderate-certainty evidence; 2887 participants), with higher scores reflecting better quality of life. We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations. Data to evaluate cancer-specific survival were not available. The effects of degarelix on cardiovascular events are very uncertain (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.61; very low-certainty evidence; 80 participants). We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations, imprecision, and indirectness as this trial was conducted in a unique group of high-risk participants with pre-existing cardiovascular morbidities. Degarelix likely results in an increase in injection site pain (RR 15.68, 95% CI 7.41 to 33.17; moderate-certainty evidence; 2670 participants). Based on 30 participants per 1000 with injection site pain with standard androgen suppression therapy, this corresponds to 440 more injection site pains per 1000 participants (192 more to 965 more). We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations. We did not identify any relevant subgroup differences for different degarelix maintenance doses. We did not find trial evidence for overall survival or cancer-specific survival comparing degarelix to standard androgen suppression, but serious adverse events and quality of life may be similar between groups. The effects of degarelix on cardiovascular events are very uncertain as the only eligible study had limitations, was small with few events, and was conducted in a high-risk population. Degarelix likely results in an increase in injection site pain compared to standard androgen suppression therapy. Maximum follow-up of included studies was 14 months, which is short. There is a need for methodologically better designed and executed studies with long-term follow-up evaluating men with metastatic prostate cancer.","How does degarelix, a newer drug that treats prostate cancer by lowering male sex hormone levels, compare to existing medications for newly diagnosed advanced prostate cancer? There is no cure if prostate cancer has spread outside of the prostate gland to lymph nodes or to the bones. In such a situation, hormonal therapy that lowers levels of the male sex hormone testosterone can slow down cancer growth. Testosterone levels are regulated by complicated mechanisms that involve a hormone known as gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which is present in men at different levels at different times of the day. It is understood that giving men with prostate cancer high levels of medications that increase GnRH levels first raises testosterone levels, and then drops them to very low levels. These medications are commonly used to treat men with prostate cancer that has spread outside the prostate. Degarelix is a newer drug known as a GnRH antagonist, which blocks receptors in the brain and thereby lowers testosterone levels immediately. We included randomized controlled trials (studies in which participants are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) comparing degarelix and standard hormonal therapy in men with newly diagnosed advanced prostate cancer. The evidence is current to September 2020 for electronic databases, to October 2020 for trial registries, and to December 2020 for conference proceedings. We found 11 studies that were eligible for inclusion in the review, but none of these studies evaluated the risk of dying from any cause or dying from prostate cancer. There may be no difference between degarelix and standard hormonal therapy in serious unwanted effects and quality of life. The effects of degarelix on cardiovascular issues such as the risk of a heart attack or stroke are uncertain; while one study suggested that the risk may be reduced with degarelix, it had major issues, in particular that it was conducted in men at high risk for such problems. We found that degarelix therapy likely results in an increase in the occurrence of pain at the injection site. The certainty of evidence for the various outcomes ranged from moderate to very low.

63d84be2c9a21026d442e728,static_2,"Education, incentive, and engineering-based interventions to promotethe use of seat belts","Over 1.3 million people die each year as a result of traffic collisions and hundreds of thousands of others are permanently and seriouslyinjured. Most of these deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries, where mortality rates can be up to 10 times higher than those ofsome high-income countries. Seat belts are designed to accomplish two key functions: to prevent the occupant from being ejected fromthe vehicle by the force of impact, and to extend the time that the decelerating force is applied to a person. Seat belts also spread the area ofimpact both to larger and less vulnerable parts of the body. Since the 1950s, seat belts have been factory-fitted to most vehicles, and todayaround 90% of high-income countries have adopted seat belt legislation that makes it mandatory for some, if not all, vehicle occupants towear seat belts. However, the simple passing of laws is not sufficient to ensure seat belt use, and, while the enforcement of seat belt lawsdoes increase seat belt use, other interventions have been developed to encourage voluntary  and hence sustainable behaviour change. To evaluate the benefits of behavioural-change interventions (educational-based, incentive-based, engineering-based, or a combination,but not enforcement-based) that promote the use of seat belts, and to determine which types of interventions are most effective. On 9 August 2022, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), OvidSP Embase, OvidSP MEDLINE, 14other databases, and clinical trials registers. We also screened reference lists and conference proceedings, searched websites of relevantorganisations, and contacted road safety experts. The search was performed with no restrictions in terms of language and date ofpublication. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), both individually randomised and cluster-randomised, that evaluated education,engineering, incentive-based interventions (or combinations) that promoted seat belt use. Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of RCTs, evaluated the risk of bias, and extracted data. We performed a narrativesynthesis based on effect direction due to the heterogeneity observed between RCTs and reported the synthesis in accordance with reporting guidelines for systematic reviews without meta-analysis, as appropriate. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using theGRADE approach. We analysed data on the primary outcome, frequency of wearing a seat belt. None of the included RCTs reported theother primary outcome, crash-related injury rate or the secondary outcome, crash-related mortality rates of interest in this review. We included 15 completed RCTs (12 individual, parallel-group, and three cluster) that enroled 12,081 participants, published between1990 and 2022. Four trials were published between 2019 and 2022, and the remaining trials were published 10 or more years ago. Wealso identified four ongoing RCTs. Thirteen RCTs were conducted in the USA. Trials recruited participants from various sites (worksites,schools, emergency departments, a residential retirement community, and primary care settings) and different age groups (adults,late adolescents, early adolescents, and dyads). Thirteen trials investigated educational interventions, one of which used education inaddition to incentives (one of the intervention arms) measured through participant self-reports (12) and observation (one), and two trialsinvestigated engineering-based interventions measured through in-vehicle data monitor systems at various follow-up periods (six weeksto 36 months). We grouped RCTs according to types of education-based interventions: behavioural education-based, health risk appraisal (HRA), andother education-based interventions. The evidence suggests that behavioural education-based (four trials) interventions may promoteseat belt use and HRA interventions (one trial) likely promote seat belt use in the short term (six weeks to nine months). Four of the sixtrials that investigated behavioural education-based interventions found that the intervention compared to no or another interventionmay promote seat belt use. These effects were measured through participant self-report and at various time points (six-week to 12-monthfollow-up) (low-certainty evidence). One of the three trials investigating HRA only or with additional intervention versus no or anotherintervention showed observed effects likely to promote seat belt use (moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence suggests that engineering-based interventions using vehicle monitoring systems (with in-vehicle alerts and with or withoutnotifications/feedback) may promote the use of seat belts. One trial showed that engineering interventions (in-vehicle alerts and feedback)may promote seat belt use while the other showed unclear effects in two of the three intervention groups (low-certainty evidence). Bothtrials had small sample sizes and high baseline seat belt use. The evidence suggests that behavioural education-based interventions may promote seat belt use and HRA (including incentives) with orwithout additional interventions likely promote seat belt use. Likewise, for engineering-based interventions using in-vehicle data monitorsystems with in-vehicle alerts, with or without notifications/feedback the evidence suggests the interventions may promote the use ofseat belts. Well-designed RCTs are needed to further investigate the effectiveness of education and engineering-based interventions. High-qualitytrials that examine the potential benefits of incentives to promote seat belt use, either alone or in combination with other interventions, aswell as trials to investigate other types of interventions (such as technology, media/publicity, enforcement, insurance schemes, employerprogrammes, etc.) to promote the use of seat belts, are needed. Evidence from low- and middle-income economies is required to improvethe generalisability of the data. In addition, research focused on determining which interventions or types of interventions are mosteffective in different population groups is needed.","Why is wearing a seat belt important? Many people, mostly children and young adults, die each year as a result of road traffic injuries suggesting it to be a leading cause of death with around 75% of traffic-related deaths occurring among young males. Many others are permanently and seriously injured. Seat belts are designed to protect occupants from being thrown out of the vehicle by the force of impact, and spread the impact across less vulnerable parts of the body to lessen the damage. Passing laws mandating seat belt use is not sufficient to encourage seat belt use on its own. We investigated the effectiveness of education, incentive, or engineering-based interventions, but not law enforcement, to encourage seat belt use and determine which types of interventions are most effective. Educational-based interventions are structured programmes teaching drivers and passengers the importance of using seat belts. Engineering-based interventions are design changes to the vehicle structure that promote the wearing of seat belts, such as seat belt alarms, while incentives include rewards schemes. We searched for studies that randomly allocated people travelling in passenger or commercial vehicles to interventions aiming to improve seat belt use. We excluded people travelling in farming or agricultural vehicles since these are not deemed commercial vehicles. Two review authors independently evaluated studies to judge inclusion in the review. We recorded information about the study design, setting, participants, interventions, and outcomes. In terms of outcome, we looked at the frequency of wearing a seat belt as well as crash-related injuries and deaths. Because of the differences between the included studies, we provided a written account and assessed how much each result could be trusted using the ratings high, moderate, low, or very low quality, depending on our confidence in the reliability of the results. We summarised the findings and compared study results. We found 15 studies enrolling 12,081 participants and four ongoing studies. Thirteen studies were conducted in the USA and enrolled participants from various sites (worksites, schools, emergency departments, a residential retirement community, and primary care settings) and of different age groups (adults, late and early adolescents, and dyads of child/adolescent and parent/legal guardian). Twelve studies looked at educational interventions alone, one at education and incentives, and two at engineering-based interventions. All included studies reported on the frequency of wearing a seat belt; however, most studies (12) reported this outcome through participant self-reporting. The remaining studies reported the frequency of wearing a seat belt through in-vehicle data monitoring systems (two studies) and observation (one study). None of the included studies reported crash-related injuries and deaths. Some evidence suggests that education-based and engineering-based interventions may promote seat belt use; however, we cannot be confident in the current evidence. For education-based interventions, evidence suggests that behavioural-based (motivational interviews, behavioural change counselling, and behavioural messages) and HRA (alone or with educational information plus incentive) interventions may improve seat belt use in early adolescents, late adolescents, and adults. The evidence suggests that engineering-based interventions may promote seat belt use in early adolescents and adults. More research is needed to better understand the effectiveness of education- and engineering-based interventions on seat belt use. In addition, high-quality research is needed to investigate the benefit of incentives alone or in combination with other interventions as well as research to investigate other types of interventions, different combinations of interventions, settings (such as low- and middle-income countries), and populations. Only two studies looked at engineering-based interventions to improve seat belt use and both studies enrolled a small number of participants making it challenging to conclude that these interventions are beneficial. Trials investigating educational interventions to improve seat belt use vary in terms of the type of intervention, quality, number and types of people in the study, etc. Studies included children, adolescents, and adults; however, the most effective intervention for each population group remains unclear. Our confidence in the evidence was low or moderate, mainly due to the outcome (wearing seat belts) being measured through participant self-reporting. Self-reported outcomes are open to being influenced by participants answering in a manner they believe to be desirable or by participants' limited recollection of the event being studied. None of the included studies was conducted in countries where deaths and injuries related to road traffic accidents are the highest.",1059,mortality rates; decelerating force; behavioural-change interventions; crash-related injury rate; engineering-based interventions; health risk appraisal,What factors might have contributed to the low certainty of evidence in the current study?,Identify the main goal of the study discussed in the summary.,Select all of the following that are colors,Summarize why seat belt laws alone are insufficient according to the summary.,Recognize the types of interventions evaluated in the study.,Inconsistencies in definitions of seat belt use.; Differences in intervention effectiveness across studies.; Inclusion of outdated intervention methods.,Differences in intervention effectiveness across studies.,To determine the most effective seat belt laws.; To evaluate interventions that promote seat belt use.; To analyze the decrease in car accidents.,To evaluate interventions that promote seat belt use.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Laws alone do not guarantee behavior change.; People do not understand the fines involved.; Drivers forget to read laws regularly.,Laws alone do not guarantee behavior change.,"Educational, incentive, and engineering-based.; Law enforcement and punishment-based.; Technological and media-based.","Educational, incentive, and engineering-based."
63d84be2c9a21026d442e728,static_2,Revascularisation of the left subclavian artery for thoracic endovascular aortic repair,"Controversy exists as to whether revascularisation of the left subclavian artery (LSA) confers improved outcomes in patients undergoing thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR). Even though preemptive revascularisation of the LSA has theoretical advantages, including a reduced risk of ischaemic damage to vital organs, such as the brain and the spinal cord, it is not without risks. Current practice guidelines recommend routine revascularisation of the LSA in patients undergoing elective TEVAR where achievement of a proximal seal necessitates coverage of the LSA, and in patients who have an anatomy that compromises perfusion to critical organs. However, this recommendation was based on very low-quality evidence. To assess the comparative efficacy of routine LSA revascularisation versus either selective or no revascularisation in patients with descending thoracic aortic disease undergoing TEVAR with coverage of the LSA origin. The Cochrane Vascular Trials Search Co-ordinator (TSC) searched the Specialised Register (June 2015). In addition, the TSC searched the Cochrane Register of Studies (CENTRAL (2015, Issue 5)).Trials databases were also searched (June 2015). We had planned to consider all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared routine revascularisation of the LSA with selective or no revascularisation, in patients undergoing TEVAR. Two review authors independently assessed the title and abstract of articles identified through literature searches. An independent third review author was consulted in the event of disagreement. We had planned for two review authors to independently extract data and assess the risk of bias of identified trials using the criteria recommended in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We did not identify any RCTs relevant to our review topic. Therefore, no quantitative analysis was conducted. High quality RCT evidence for or against routine or selective revascularisation of the LSA in TEVAR is not currently available. It is not possible to draw conclusions with regard to the optimal management of LSA coverage in TEVAR, and whether routine revascularisation, which was defined as the intervention of interest in our review, confers beneficial effects, as indicated by reduced mortality, cerebrovascular events, and spinal cord ischaemia. This review highlights the need for continued research to provide RCT evidence and define the role of LSA revascularisation in the context of TEVAR with coverage of the LSA.","The thoracic aorta is the largest blood vessel in the chest. It originates from the heart and supplies blood to the whole body. It can be affected by several diseases, including an aneurysm, which is an enlargement of a weakened section of the aorta, and dissection, which occurs when a tear in the aortic lining causes blood to flow between the layers of the wall of the aorta, forcing the layers apart. The traditional treatment of these conditions is open surgical repair. Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) has evolved as an alternative treatment for a wide variety of aortic diseases. It is less invasive than open surgery, and involves inserting an artificial graft (a tube composed of fabric) into the thoracic aorta through an artery in the groin (the femoral artery), to help reinforce the aortic wall. A significant proportion of patients with thoracic aortic disease have abnormalities close to, or involving the origin of the left subclavian artery (LSA; one of the branches of the thoracic aorta). In these situations, the aortic stent graft needs to be placed close to the LSA, thereby blocking the blood vessel opening. This can potentially result in reduced blood supply to the brain and spinal cord, causing stroke and spinal cord ischaemia (spinal cord stroke). This review aimed to look at the value of a surgical bypass, which can provide an alternative route for blood supply (revascularisation) to the brain and spinal cord in cases of TEVAR, where the LSA is covered. Controversy exists as to whether routine revascularisation of the LSA, with a surgical bypass, results in improved outcomes in patients undergoing TEVAR, as measured by a reduced risk of stroke and paraplegia (paralysis of the legs). Even though preemptive LSA revascularisation has theoretical advantages, it is not without risks, including nerve damage, bleeding, and graft infection. The Society for Vascular Surgery Practice Guidelines recommend routine revascularisation of the LSA in non-emergency TEVAR, where the LSA origin is covered. However, this recommendation was based on very low-quality evidence. We undertook a comprehensive, systematic search of the pertinent literature to identify the best available evidence and had planned to synthesise outcome data from randomised controlled trials (RCTs), in order to assist clinicians and patients to make evidence-based decisions. We did not identify any RCTs investigating our study question (evidence current until June 2015). The best available evidence comes from non-randomised comparative studies. There is a need for high quality RCTs providing more robust evidence. It was not possible to evaluate the quality of evidence in the absence of studies eligible for the review.",1067,revascularisation; thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR); left subclavian artery (LSA); proximal seal; ischaemic damage; vital organs; descending thoracic aortic disease; cerebrovascular events; spinal cord ischaemia; perfusion,How could the absence of RCTs affect the evaluation of LSA revascularisation in TEVAR?,What implications does the current evidence level have for the validity of the Society for Vascular Surgery's guidelines on LSA revascularisation?,Select all of the following that are colors,What is the primary goal of the review regarding the LSA in TEVAR?,Describe the main issue with the current evidence for LSA revascularisation.,It limits the ability to draw conclusions about best practices.; It enhances the reliability of existing guidelines based on non-RCT evidence.; It necessitates reliance on anecdotal evidence.,It limits the ability to draw conclusions about best practices.,The guidelines are based on low-quality evidence and may be challenged.; The guidelines are definitive and should not be questioned.; The guidelines are irrelevant due to the lack of RCTs.,The guidelines are based on low-quality evidence and may be challenged.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,To determine the efficacy of surgical bypass for LSA; To compare surgical and non-surgical treatments for aortic aneurysms; To study the causes of thoracic aortic disease,To determine the efficacy of surgical bypass for LSA,Low-quality evidence; Overwhelming evidence of risks; Complete lack of studies,Low-quality evidence
63d84be2c9a21026d442e728,interactive_3,Drug or psychological interventions for preventing depression in people with long-term physical conditions,"Major depression is one of the world's leading causes of disability in adults with long-term physical conditions compared to those without physical illness. This co-morbidity is associated with a negative prognosis in terms of increased morbidity and mortality rates, increased healthcare costs, decreased adherence to treatment regimens, and a substantial decline in quality of life. Therefore, preventing the onset of depressive episodes in adults with long-term physical conditions should be a global healthcare aim. In this review, primary or tertiary (in cases of preventing recurrences in those with a history of depression) prevention are the focus. While primary prevention aims at preventing the onset of depression, tertiary prevention comprises both preventing recurrences and prohibiting relapses. Tertiary prevention aims to address a depressive episode that might still be present, is about to subside, or has recently resolved. We included tertiary prevention in the case where the focus was preventing the onset of depression in those with a history of depression (preventing recurrences) but excluded it if it specifically focused on maintaining an condition or implementing rehabilitation services (relapse prevention). Secondary prevention of depression seeks to prevent the progression of depressive symptoms by early detection and treatment and may therefore be considered a 'treatment,' rather than prevention. We therefore exclude the whole spectrum of secondary prevention. To assess the effectiveness, acceptability and tolerability of psychological or pharmacological interventions, in comparison to control conditions, in preventing depression in adults with long-term physical conditions; either before first ever onset of depressive symptoms (i.e. primary prevention) or before first onset of depressive symptoms in patients with a history of depression (i.e. tertiary prevention). We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and two trials registries, up to 6 February 2020. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of preventive psychological or pharmacological interventions, specifically targeting incidence of depression in comparison to treatment as usual (TAU), waiting list, attention/psychological placebo, or placebo. Participants had to be age 18 years or older, with at least one long-term physical condition, and no diagnosis of major depression at baseline (primary prevention). In addition, we included studies comprising mixed samples of patients with and without a history of depression, which explored tertiary prevention of recurrent depression. We excluded other tertiary prevention studies. We also excluded secondary preventive interventions. Primary outcomes included incidence of depression, tolerability, and acceptability. Secondary outcomes included severity of depression, cost-effectiveness and cost-utility. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We included 11 RCTs, with one trial on psychological interventions, and 10 trials on pharmacological interventions. Data analyses on the psychological intervention (problem-solving therapy compared to TAU) included 194 participants with age-related macular degeneration. Data analyses on pharmacological interventions included 837 participants comparing citalopram (one trial), escitalopram (three trials), a mixed sample of fluoxetine/nortriptyline (one trial), melatonin (one trial), milnacipran (one trial), and sertraline (three trials), each to placebo. Included types of long-term physical conditions were acute coronary syndrome (one trial), breast cancer (one trial), head and neck cancer (two trials), stroke (five trials), and traumatic brain injury (one trial). Very low-certainty evidence of one study suggests that problem solving therapy may be slightly more effective than TAU in preventing the incidence of depression, immediately post-intervention (odds ratio (OR) 0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.20 to 0.95; 194 participants). However, there may be little to no difference between groups at six months follow-up (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.38; 190 participants; one study; very low-certainty evidence). No data were available regarding incidence of depression after six months. Regarding acceptability (drop-outs due to any cause), slightly fewer drop-outs occurred in the TAU group immediately post-intervention (OR 5.21, 95% CI 1.11 to 24.40; 206 participants; low-certainty evidence). After six months, however, the groups did not differ (OR 1.67, 95% CI 0.58 to 4.77; 206 participants; low-certainty evidence). This study did not measure tolerability. Post-intervention, compared to placebo, antidepressants may be beneficial in preventing depression in adults with different types of long-term physical conditions, but the evidence is very uncertain (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.49; 814 participants; nine studies; I2 = 0%; very low-certainty evidence). There may be little to no difference between groups both immediately and at six months follow-up (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.08 to 2.46; 23 participants; one study; very low-certainty evidence) as well as at six to 12 months follow-up (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.23 to 2.82; 233 participants; three studies; I2 = 49%; very low-certainty evidence). There was very low-certainty evidence from five studies regarding the tolerability of the pharmacological intervention. A total of 669 adverse events were observed in 316 participants from the pharmacological intervention group, and 610 adverse events from 311 participants in the placebo group. There was very low-certainty evidence that drop-outs due to adverse events may be less frequent in the placebo group (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.07 to 3.89; 561 participants; five studies; I2 = 0%). There was also very low-certainty evidence that drop-outs due to any cause may not differ between groups either post-intervention (OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.73; 962 participants; nine studies; I2 = 28%), or at six to 12 months (OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.86; 327 participants; three studies; I2 = 0%). Based on evidence of very low certainty, our results may indicate the benefit of pharmacological interventions, during or directly after preventive treatment. Few trials examined short-term outcomes up to six months, nor the follow-up effects at six to 12 months, with studies suffering from great numbers of drop-outs and inconclusive results. Generalisation of results is limited as study populations and treatment regimes were very heterogeneous. Based on the results of this review, we conclude that for adults with long-term physical conditions, there is only very uncertain evidence regarding the implementation of any primary preventive interventions (psychological/pharmacological) for depression.","People with long-term illness or other physical health conditions have a higher risk than other people of developing depression. This can reduce their quality of life. Depression is characterised by symptoms such as low mood, feelings of hopelessness, loss of interest in things that once gave pleasure, and other symptoms, as well as sleep disturbances. People with long-term physical conditions who develop depression are more likely to worsen in their illnesses and are more likely to die. Therefore, preventing depression in people with long-term physical conditions should be an important goal in healthcare. We wanted to know whether standard interventions for treating depression (i.e. psychological treatments and antidepressant drugs) can also safely be used to prevent the onset of an depressive episode in those adults at high risk for depression due to their long-term physical condition, but who do not yet show depressive symptoms. We also wanted to know whether these interventions worked in preventing recurrent depression, in those patients with long-term physical conditions who had a history of depression. First, we searched the medical literature for randomised controlled studies (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups). This type of study provides the most robust evidence about the effects of a treatment. We then compared the results, and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we assessed how certain the evidence was. To do this, we considered factors such as the way studies were conducted, study sizes, and consistency of findings across studies. Based on our assessments, we categorised the evidence as being of very low, low, moderate or high certainty. Medical and mental health care providers (including physicians and psychologists) and pharmacists, as well as adults with long-term physical conditions, their relatives and care-givers. This review includes 11 trials comparing a psychological intervention (problem-solving therapy) to treatment as usual; or comparing pharmacological antidepressant interventions (citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline, fluoxetine/nortriptyline, milnacipran, or melatonin) to placebo. For the psychological intervention, we found only one trial, including 194 people with age-related macular degeneration (an eye disease). For pharmacological interventions, we included 10 trials comprising 1009 people. Due to some participants not completing the studies, we could only analyse data for 837 participants. Our analyses show that people with long-term physical conditions may be less likely to develop depression during treatment with problem solving therapy, or with different types of antidepressants. However, these interventions appear to be beneficial only during treatment. Three to 12 months after treatment, there was no significant difference in onset of depression between the groups that had the interventions and those that did not. Therefore, preventive interventions might be effective in preventing depression onset only for the duration of the intervention. Our conclusions are based on evidence of very low certainty. In addition, there is not enough adequate information on the tolerability (unpleasant but generally medically less important adverse events due to the intervention, e.g. dry mouth) and acceptability (willingness to go through with the intervention even in the presence of adverse events) of these treatments. The interventions may be unsafe, irrespective of their potential to prevent depression.",1119,major depression; disability; co-morbidity; primary prevention; tertiary prevention; depressive episodes; psychological interventions; pharmacological interventions; antidepressants; very low-certainty evidence,"Based on the summary, how valid is it to generalize the study findings to all adults with long-term physical conditions?",What are the main reasons for attempting to prevent depression in people with long-term physical conditions?,Select the items that are animals,How might the onset of depression affect people with long-term physical conditions?,Which interventions were assessed for preventing depression in the study?,"Highly valid, as the study included a large diverse cohort.; Limited validity due to varied physical conditions represented.; Invalid, as the study focused solely on specific conditions like cancer and stroke.",Limited validity due to varied physical conditions represented.,To reduce the risk of developing depression; To increase healthcare costs; To prevent worsening of physical illnesses,To reduce the risk of developing depression; To prevent worsening of physical illnesses,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,It may improve their quality of life; It may increase the risk of mortality; It may decrease adherence to their treatment,It may increase the risk of mortality; It may decrease adherence to their treatment,Psychological interventions; Dietary supplements; Pharmacological interventions,Psychological interventions; Pharmacological interventions
63d84be2c9a21026d442e728,interactive_4,Glucagon-like peptide analogues for type 2 diabetes,"Glucagon-like peptide analogues are a new class of drugs used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes that mimic the endogenous hormone glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1). GLP-1 is an incretin, a gastrointestinal hormone that is released into the circulation in response to ingested nutrients. GLP-1 regulates glucose levels by stimulating glucose-dependent insulin secretion and biosynthesis, and by suppressing glucagon secretion, delayed gastric emptying and promoting satiety.
To assess the effects of glucagon-like peptide analogues in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Studies were obtained from electronic searches of The Cochrane Library (last search issue 1, 2011), MEDLINE (last search March 2011), EMBASE (last search March 2011), Web of Science (last search March 2011) and databases of ongoing trials.
Studies were included if they were randomised controlled trials of a minimum duration of eight weeks comparing a GLP-1 analogue with placebo, insulin, an oral anti-diabetic agent, or another GLP-1 analogue in people with type 2 diabetes.
Data extraction and quality assessment of studies were done by one reviewer and checked by a second. Data were analysed by type of GLP-1 agonist and comparison treatment. Where appropriate, data were summarised in a meta-analysis (mean differences and risk ratios summarised using a random-effects model).
Seventeen randomised controlled trials including relevant analyses for 6899 participants were included in the analysis. Studies were mostly of short duration, usually 26 weeks. In comparison with placebo, all GLP-1 agonists reduced glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels by about 1%. Exenatide 2 mg once weekly and liraglutide 1.8 mg reduced it by 0.20% and 0.24% respectively more than insulin glargine. Exenatide 2 mg once weekly reduced HbA1c more than exenatide 10 ?g twice daily, sitagliptin and pioglitazone. Liraglutide 1.8 mg reduced HbA1c by 0.33% more than exenatide 10 ?g twice daily. Liraglutide led to similar improvements in HbA1c compared to sulphonylureas but reduced it more than sitagliptin and rosiglitazone. Both exenatide and liraglutide led to greater weight loss than most active comparators, including in participants not experiencing nausea. Hypoglycaemia occurred more frequently in participants taking concomitant sulphonylurea. GLP-1 agonists caused gastrointestinal adverse effects, mainly nausea. These adverse events were strongest at the beginning and then subsided. Beta-cell function was improved with GLP-1 agonists but the effect did not persist after cessation of treatment. None of the studies was long enough to assess long-term positive or negative effects.
GLP-1 agonists are effective in improving glycaemic control.","Glucagon-like peptide analogues or agonists are a new kind of drug in the treatment of type 2 diabetes that are given by injection under the skin. They regulate glucose levels by stimulating glucose-dependent insulin secretion and biosynthesis, and by suppressing glucagon secretion, delaying gastric emptying and promoting satiety. Various glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists are in use or in the licensing process, including exenatide, liraglutide, albiglutide, taspoglutide, lixisenatide and LY2189265.
Seventeen randomised controlled trials of mostly moderate to high quality randomised approximately 6899 people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Studies were mostly of short duration, usually 26 weeks. The longest duration study was 30 weeks. Of the seventeen studies, one compared albiglutide with placebo, two compared exenatide 10µg twice daily against exenatide 2 mg once weekly, one compared exenatide 2 mg once weekly against insulin glargine, one compared exenatide 2 mg once weekly against pioglitazone and sitagliptin, five compared liraglutide with placebo, two compared liraglutide with sulphonylurea, one each compared exenatide twice daily with liraglutide, liraglutide with sitagliptin, liraglutide with rosiglitazone and liraglutide with insulin glargine, two compared taspoglutide with placebo and one each compared lixisenatide with placebo and LY2189265 with placebo. In people already treated with oral anti-diabetes drugs, addition of glucagon-like peptide analogues improved blood sugar control in comparison to placebo, rosiglitazone, pioglitazone or sitagliptin, but not always in comparison to insulin (for exenatide) or glimepiride (a sulphonylurea). Glucagon-like peptide analogous caused more weight loss than any of the comparison treatments. However, more nausea and other gastrointestinal effects such as diarrhoea or vomiting were seen, though these tended to wear off and were not seen in all participants. There was slightly more hypoglycaemia with glucagon-like analogous than with placebo, but generally less than with other anti-diabetic treatments. The incidence of hypoglycaemia occurred more frequently in participants taking concomitant sulphonylurea. The studies were not long enough to assess long-term side effects.

63d84be2c9a21026d442e728,interactive_4,Thienopyridine derivatives versus aspirin for preventing stroke and other serious vascular events in high vascular risk patients,"Aspirin is the most widely studied and prescribed antiplatelet agent for preventing serious vascular events, reducing the odds of such events among high vascular risk patients by about a quarter. Thienopyridine derivatives inhibit platelet activation by a different mechanism and so may be more effective. To determine the effectiveness and safety of thienopyridine derivatives (ticlopidine and clopidogrel) versus aspirin for preventing serious vascular events (stroke, myocardial infarction (MI) or vascular death) in patients at high risk, and specifically in patients with a previous TIA or ischaemic stroke. We searched the trials registers of the Stroke, Heart and Peripheral Vascular Diseases Cochrane Review Groups (last searched July 2008), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2008), MEDLINE (1966 to August 2008) and EMBASE (1980 to August 2008). We also searched reference lists of relevant papers, and contacted other researchers and the pharmaceutical company Sanofi-BMS (December 2008). All unconfounded, double blind, randomised trials directly comparing a thienopyridine derivative with aspirin in high vascular risk patients. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. We sought additional data from the principal investigators of the largest trials. We included 10 trials involving 26,865 high vascular risk patients. The trials were generally of high quality. Aspirin was compared with ticlopidine in nine trials (7633 patients) and with clopidogrel in one trial (19,185 patients). Compared with aspirin, allocation to a thienopyridine produced a modest, just statistically significant, reduction in the odds of a serious vascular event (11.6% versus 12.5%; odds ratio (OR) 0.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85 to 0.99), corresponding to the avoidance of 10 (95% CI 0 to 20) serious vascular events per 1000 patients treated for about two years. However, the wide confidence interval includes the possibility of negligible additional benefit. Compared with aspirin, thienopyridines significantly reduced gastrointestinal adverse effects. However, thienopyridines increased the odds of skin rash and diarrhoea, ticlopidine more than clopidogrel. Allocation to ticlopidine, but not clopidogrel, significantly increased the odds of neutropenia. In patients with TIA/ischaemic stroke, the results were similar to those for all patients combined. The thienopyridine derivatives are at least as effective as aspirin in preventing serious vascular events in patients at high risk, and possibly somewhat more so. However, the size of any additional benefit is uncertain and could be negligible. Clopidogrel has a more favourable adverse effects profile than ticlopidine and so is the thienopyridine of choice. It should be used as an alternative to aspirin in patients genuinely intolerant of or allergic to aspirin.","Most strokes and heart attacks are caused by a blood clot blocking the blood supply to part of the brain (to cause stroke) or to the heart (to cause a heart attack). Aspirin prevents blood clots forming, and it can reduce the risk of a further heart attack or stroke in people who have had a stroke or heart attack or other symptoms of vascular disease. Clopidogrel and ticlopidine are two similar drugs called thienopyridines which prevent clots in a different way to aspirin. This review of 10 trials comparing either clopidogrel or ticlopidine with aspirin in about 27,000 people found that clopidogrel and ticlopidine were at least as effective as aspirin for the prevention of stroke and heart attacks, and might be slightly more effective. In terms of adverse effects, compared with aspirin, clopidogrel and ticlopidine caused less stomach upset and less bleeding from the gut, but more diarrhoea and skin rash. Ticlopidine produced more of these last two adverse effects than clopidogrel when compared with aspirin. Ticlopidine can also cause suppression of the bone marrow production of blood cells, which can be a serious complication. Clopidogrel is therefore the thienopyridine of choice since it is safer and better tolerated. However, since it is substantially more expensive than aspirin and not clearly more effective, it should generally only be used instead of aspirin in patients who are unable to take aspirin.",1071,Antiplatelet agent; Thienopyridine derivatives; Platelet activation; Vascular events; Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA); Ticlopidine; Clopidogrel; Gastrointestinal adverse effects; Neutropenia; Adverse effects profile,What is the primary purpose of aspirin in patients with previous stroke or heart attack?,Which of the following describes the main comparison in the study?,Select all of the following that are colors,"According to the summary, what were the two main adverse effects more common with thienopyridines?",Which thienopyridine is recommended as an alternative to aspirin based on its safety profile?,To prevent blood clots from forming; To cure strokes and heart attacks; To increase bone marrow production,To prevent blood clots from forming,Comparing thienopyridines with aspirin; Comparing aspirin with placebos; Comparing ticlopidine with clopidogrel,Comparing thienopyridines with aspirin,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Diarrhoea and skin rash; Heart attack and stroke; Neutropenia and bone pain,Diarrhoea and skin rash,Clopidogrel; Ticlopidine; Aspirin,Clopidogrel
63d84be2c9a21026d442e728,finetuned_5,Does treatment with GLP-1 receptor agonists prevent complications for people with chronic kidney disease and diabetes?,"Approximately 40% of people with diabetes develop kidney failure and experience an accelerated risk of cardiovascular complications. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are glucose-lowering agents that manage glucose and weight control.
We assessed the benefits and harms of GLP-1 receptor agonists in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes.
The Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies was searched to 10 September 2024 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.
Randomised controlled studies were eligible if participants with diabetes and CKD were randomly allocated to a GLP-1 receptor agonist, placebo, standard care or a second glucose-lowering agent. CKD included all stages (from 1 to 5).
Three authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias using the risk of bias assessment tool 2. Pooled analyses using summary estimates of effects were obtained using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and/or hazard ratio (HR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. The primary outcomes included death (all-cause and cardiovascular), 3- and 4-point major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), kidney failure, composite kidney outcome, and severe hypoglycaemia. The secondary outcomes included non-fatal or fatal myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke, non-fatal peripheral arterial events, heart failure, hospitalisation due to heart failure, estimated glomerular filtration rate or creatinine clearance, doubling of serum creatinine, urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio, albuminuria progression, vascular access outcomes, body weight, body mass index, fatigue, life participation, peritoneal dialysis infection, peritoneal dialysis failure, adverse events, serious adverse events, withdrawal due to adverse events, HbA1c, sudden death, acute MI, ischaemic stroke, and coronary revascularisation. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.
Forty-two studies involving 48,148 participants were included. All studies were conducted on people with type 2 diabetes, and no studies were carried out on children. The median study age was 66 years. The median study follow-up was 26 weeks. Six studies were conducted in people with CKD stages 1-2, 11 studies in people with CKD stages 3-5, one study in people on dialysis, and the remaining studies included people with both CKD stages 1-2 and 3-5. Risks of bias in the included studies for all the primary outcomes in studies that compared GLP-1 receptor agonists to placebo were low in most methodological domains, except one study that was assessed at high risk of bias due to missing outcome data for death (all-cause and cardiovascular). The overall risk of bias for all-cause and cardiovascular death in studies that reported the treatment effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists compared to standard care, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors or sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors were assessed as unclear or at high risk of bias due to deviations from intended interventions or missing data. For GLP-1 receptor agonists compared to insulin or another GLP-1 receptor agonist, the risk of bias for all-cause and cardiovascular death was low or unclear. Compared to placebo, GLP-1 receptor agonists probably reduced the risk of all-cause death (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.98; I²= 23%; 8 studies, 17,861 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), but may have little or no effect on cardiovascular death (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.05; I²= 42%; 7 studies, 17,801 participants; low-certainty evidence). Compared to placebo, GLP-1 receptor agonists probably decreased 3-point MACE (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.98; I² = 65%; 4 studies, 19,825 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and 4-point MACE compared to placebo (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.89; 1 study, 2,158 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Based on absolute risks of clinical outcomes, it is likely that GLP-1 receptor agonists prevent all-cause death in 52 people with CKD stages 1-2 and 116 in CKD stages 3-5, cardiovascular death in 34 people with CKD stages 1-2 and 71 in CKD stages 3-5, while 95 CKD stages 1-2 and 153 in CKD stages 3-5 might experience a major cardiovascular event for every 1000 people treated over 1 year. Compared to placebo, GLP-1 receptor agonists probably had little or no effect on kidney failure, defined as starting dialysis or kidney transplant (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.13; I²= 0%; 3 studies, 4,134 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), or on composite kidney outcomes (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.02; I²= 0%; 2 studies, 16,849 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Compared to placebo, GLP-1 receptor agonists may have little or no effect on the risk of severe hypoglycaemia (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.25; I² = 44%; 4 studies, 6,292 participants; low-certainty evidence). The effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists compared to standard care or other hypoglycaemic agents were uncertain. No studies evaluated treatment on risks of fatigue, life participation, amputation or fracture.
GLP-1 receptor agonists probably reduced all-cause death but may have little or no effect on cardiovascular death in people with CKD and diabetes. GLP-1 receptor agonists probably lower major cardiovascular events, probably have little or no effect on kidney failure and composite kidney outcomes, and may have little or no effect on the risk of severe hypoglycaemia in people with CKD and diabetes.","Chronic kidney disease (CKD) (a long-term condition where the kidneys do not work effectively) and diabetes (a lifelong condition that causes a person's blood sugar level to become too high) are chronic conditions that bring on many challenges for people, particularly when they have to manage both at the same time. Diabetes can accelerate the development of kidney disease and is the leading cause of kidney failure (a condition where the kidneys no longer function well enough to keep a person alive). GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1) are medicines that lower blood glucose levels and may also have beneficial effects on high blood pressure and obesity, and decrease the chances of death, heart attack, stroke and kidney failure (a condition where the kidneys no longer function well enough to keep a person alive).
We wanted to find out if GLP-1 improves diabetes control and kidney function, decreases heart-related complications such as heart attacks and stroke, and decreases the risk of kidney failure in people with both CKD and diabetes.
We searched for all trials that assessed the benefits and harms of GLP-1 for treating people with both CKD and diabetes. We compared GLP-1 with placebo (dummy medicine), usual care, and other glucose-lowering medicines (for example, insulin).
We included 42 studies that randomised 48,148 adults (18 years or older) with CKD and diabetes. None of the studies included children. The number of people ranged from 7 to 14,691, and the age ranged from 51 to 71 years. On average, the duration of the studies was six months. Twenty-one studies compared GLP-1 to placebo, 16 compared GLP-1 to a variety of glucose-lowering medicines, and five compared GLP-1 to standard care. Twenty-eight studies were multinational.
Compared to placebo, GLP-1 probably reduces the overall risk of dying due to any cause but may have little or no effect on the chances of dying from a heart-related problem. When major heart-related events were investigated together (death due to a heart attack, nonfatal heart attack and nonfatal stroke), GLP-1 probably reduces the risk of these combined events occurring. GLP-1 probably makes little or no difference to kidney failure and may make little or no difference to abnormally low blood glucose levels.
The effect of GLP-1 compared to usual care and other glucose-lowering medicines is unclear.
We are moderately confident that GLP-1 reduces the risk of dying due to any cause, reduces major heart-related events, and makes little or no difference to kidney failure. We are less confident in its effect on death from a heart-related problem or abnormally low blood sugar levels.

63d84be2c9a21026d442e728,finetuned_6,Does yoga relieve cancer-related fatigue in people with cancer?,"Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is one of the most prevalent symptoms in individuals with cancer. Various types of exercise have shown beneficial effects. While previous systematic reviews suggest exercise may improve CRF and quality of life, evidence specifically about yoga's impact, as well as evidence on long-term effects, is limited. Previous syntheses offer promising but inconclusive findings on yoga's effectiveness. This review is one of a suite of five reviews exploring exercise for cancer-related fatigue.
To assess the effects of yoga versus no yoga on cancer-related fatigue in people with cancer: before, during, and after anticancer treatment; in the short, medium, and long term; and effects on quality of life (QoL), adverse events, depression, and anxiety.
We used CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, five other databases and two trials registers, together with reference checking, citation searching and contact with study authors to identify studies that are included in the review. The latest search date was October 2023.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing yoga to no yoga. We included studies in adults (aged 18 and older) with any type of cancer and anticancer therapy who received yoga before, during, or after anticancer therapy. We included trials evaluating at least one of the main outcomes (CRF or QoL). Yoga had to last for at least five sessions, and involve face-to-face instruction. We excluded trials with fewer than 20 participants randomised per group.
The outcomes of interest in this review are cancer-related fatigue (CRF), quality of life (QoL), adverse events, depression, and anxiety. We used standard methods expected by Cochrane. For analyses, we pooled results within the same period of outcome assessment (i.e. short, medium, and long term), and employed a random-effects model. We assessed risk of bias with the Cochrane risk of bias (RoB) 1 tool, and used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence.
We included 21 RCTs with 2041 people with cancer who received yoga during (13 studies) or after (eight studies) anticancer therapy; none examined yoga initiated before therapy. Here we present results on CRF and QoL; findings on adverse events, depression, and anxiety are in the full review. Yoga during anticancer therapy The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of yoga compared to no yoga on: short-term CRF (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.18 to 0.32; mean difference (MD) on Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI; lower values mean better outcome) of 0.16, 95% CI -0.41 to 0.71; 3 studies, 253 participants); medium-term CRF (MD on Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI; lower values mean better outcome) of -1.30, 95% CI -3.50 to 0.90; 1 study, 67 participants); and long-term CRF (MD 0.09 on BFI, 95% CI 1.16 to 0.98; 2 studies, 155 participants) (all very low-certainty evidence). Yoga may have a small beneficial effect or no effect compared to no yoga on short-term QoL (SMD 0.25, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.45; MD on Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30 (QLQ-C30; higher values mean better outcome) of 5.28, 95% CI 0.84 to 9.56; 4 studies, 374 participants) and medium-term QoL (MD on QLQ-C30 of 7.63, 95% CI 6.71 to 21.97; 2 studies, 151 participants), but the evidence is very uncertain (all very low-certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported long-term QoL. Yoga after anticancer therapy Yoga probably has a beneficial effect compared to no yoga on short-term CRF (SMD -0.26, 95% CI -0.42 to -0.09; MD 2.55, 95% CI 0.88 to 4.12; higher values mean better outcome; 5 studies, 602 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Yoga might have a beneficial effect or no effect compared to no yoga on medium-term CRF, but the evidence is very uncertain (MD 3.02, 95% CI -1.48 to 7.52; 1 study, 54 participants (higher values mean better outcome; very low-certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported long-term CRF. Yoga may have a small beneficial effect or no effect compared to no yoga on short-term QoL (SMD 0.19, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.47; MD -3.27, 95% CI -8.08 to 1.55; higher values mean better outcome; 4 studies, 275 participants) and medium term QoL (MD 7.06, 95% CI -1.38 to 15.50; 1 study, 54 participants; higher values mean better outcome), but the evidence is very uncertain (all very low-certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported long-term QoL. A key limitation of the review was the included studies' methodological constraints: participants' awareness of treatment assignments (yoga or control) potentially introduced bias. Additionally, sample sizes were too small to determine medium- and long-term effects conclusively. Further research is needed to evaluate the sustainability of yoga's impact on cancer-related fatigue, quality of life, and adverse events.
Our review provides uncertain evidence of the beneficial effects of yoga initiated during or after anticancer therapy compared to no yoga for people with cancer. Although there are indications supporting the use of yoga to address CRF, the uncertainty of the evidence underscores the need for caution in its implementation. Future RCTs should employ rigorous methodologies, enroll sufficient participants, and use appropriate controls.","Cancer-related fatigue is a feeling of extreme tiredness that lasts for a long time. It can be caused by cancer, cancer therapy, or both. Cancer-related fatigue affects the body and mood and makes it hard to perform regular activities. It is stronger than just being tired and does not go away by resting. Clinical guidelines recommend physical exercise to improve cancer-related fatigue. Physical exercise affects cancer-related fatigue by influencing biological and psychological processes, but it is unclear what types of exercise may be most beneficial. Yoga may reduce cancer-related fatigue and improve quality of life because it combines physical movement with breath control, mental focus, and body awareness. This review explored whether yoga improves cancer-related fatigue and quality of life in adults. We also examined whether any adverse events occurred in the studies. We investigated short-term (up to 12 weeks), medium-term (12 weeks to 6 months), and long-term (more than 6 months) effects. We searched for studies comparing yoga with no yoga in adults with any cancer, including yoga done before, during, or after anticancer therapy. Multiple types of yoga were included, such as Hatha and Dru yoga. We compared and summarised the results, assessed study quality, and considered differences based on type of yoga, cancer type, format of exercise (group vs individual; supervised vs unsupervised), and participant age. We found 21 studies involving 2041 participants with various cancers, mostly women with breast cancer. Yoga was initiated during anticancer therapy in 13 studies and after therapy in eight studies; no studies examined yoga before treatment. It is unclear whether yoga during anticancer therapy improves short, medium, or long-term cancer-related fatigue. Yoga during therapy may increase short- and medium-term quality of life, but the evidence is very uncertain, and no studies measured long-term quality of life. Only one study reported adverse events, so it is unclear whether yoga affects safety outcomes. No meaningful differences were found between different yoga types, training formats, supervision levels, or cancer types. Yoga after anticancer therapy probably reduces short-term cancer-related fatigue, but its effects on medium-term fatigue are unclear, and long-term fatigue was not measured. Yoga after therapy may slightly increase short and medium-term quality of life, but evidence is very uncertain, and long-term outcomes were not assessed. It is also unclear whether yoga after therapy leads to adverse events, and no differences were found between yoga types, cancer types, or age groups. Limitations include lack of blinding, which may influence results, and small or insufficiently long studies for several outcomes. More research is needed to determine how sustainable the effects of yoga are on cancer-related fatigue, quality of life, and adverse events.",1014,Cancer-related fatigue; anticancer therapy; quality of life; adverse events; Brief Fatigue Inventory; Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory; Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30,What factors were examined to assess study quality and differences in yoga's effects?,What is the potential impact of yoga on medium-term quality of life for cancer patients?,Select the items that are animals,What was the primary focus of the study reviewed in the plain-language summary?,What uncertainty is highlighted in the evidence regarding yoga's effect on quality of life during anticancer therapy?,"Type of yoga, format of exercise, and participant age; Geographic location of studies; Financial support of participants","Type of yoga, format of exercise, and participant age",The impact is unclear due to very uncertain evidence; There is a definite significant improvement; It consistently decreases quality of life,The impact is unclear due to very uncertain evidence,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,To compare the effects of different types of yoga on weight loss; To assess the impact of yoga on cancer-related fatigue and quality of life; To examine dietary interventions for cancer patients,To assess the impact of yoga on cancer-related fatigue and quality of life,No studies assessed long-term quality of life; Yoga significantly decreases quality of life; Certainty of increased short- and medium-term quality of life,No studies assessed long-term quality of life
63d84be2c9a21026d442e728,finetuned_6,Insulin detemir versus insulin glargine for type 2 diabetes mellitus,"Chronically elevated blood glucose levels are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Many diabetes patients will eventually require insulin treatment to maintain good glycaemic control. There are still uncertainties about the optimal insulin treatment regimens for type 2 diabetes, but the long-acting insulin analogues seem beneficial. Several reviews have compared either insulin detemir or insulin glargine to NPH insulin, but research directly comparing both insulin analogues is limited.
To assess the effects of insulin detemir and insulin glargine compared with each other in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, online registries of ongoing trials and abstract books. Date of last search was January 2011.
All randomised controlled trials comparing insulin detemir with insulin glargine with a duration of 12 weeks or longer were included.
Two authors independently selected the studies and extracted the data. Pooling of studies by means of random-effects meta-analysis was performed.
This review examined four trials lasting 24 to 52 weeks involving 2250 people randomised to either insulin detemir or glargine. Overall, risk of bias of the evaluated studies was high. Insulin glargine was dosed once-daily in the evening. Insulin detemir was initiated once-daily in the evening with the option of an additional dose in the morning in three studies and initiated twice-daily in one study. Of randomised patients 13.6% to 57.2% were injecting insulin detemir twice-daily at the end of trial. Glycaemic control, measured by glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and HbA1c equal to or less than 7% with or without hypoglycaemia, did not differ statistically significantly between treatment groups. The results showed no significant differences in overall, nocturnal and severe hypoglycaemia between treatment groups. Insulin detemir was associated with less weight gain. Treatment with insulin glargine resulted in a lower daily basal insulin dose and a lower number of injection site reactions. There was no significant difference in the variability of FPG or glucose values in 24-hour profiles between treatment groups. It was not possible to draw conclusions on quality of life, costs or mortality. Only one trial reported results on health-related quality of life and showed no significant differences between treatment groups.
Our analyses suggest that there is no clinically relevant difference in efficacy or safety between insulin detemir and insulin glargine for targeting hyperglycaemia. However, to achieve the same glycaemic control insulin detemir was often injected twice-daily in a higher dose but with less weight gain, while insulin glargine was injected once-daily, with somewhat fewer injection site reactions.","The two long-acting insulin analogues (artificial insulins), insulin detemir or insulin glargine differ in their mechanism of attaining protracted action, leading to possible differences in glycaemic control and safety outcomes. Several studies have compared either insulin detemir or insulin glargine to NPH (Neutral Protamin Hagedorn) insulin. Research directly comparing both long-acting insulin analogues is limited.
Our aim was to systematically review the efficacy and safety of insulin detemir and insulin glargine in head-to-head studies in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Four studies investigated a total of 2250 people. Trials lasted between 24 and 52 weeks. Overall, risk of bias of the evaluated studies was high. Our analysis of these intermediate term trials comparing insulin detemir with insulin glargine showed that these two insulins were equally effective in achieving and maintaining glycaemic control (glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)). There were no differences in overall, nocturnal and severe hypoglycaemia when comparing insulin detemir to insulin glargine. Insulin detemir was associated with significantly less weight gain (one study showing a difference of 0.9 kg). Treatment with insulin glargine resulted in a lower daily basal insulin dose and a lower number of injection site reactions (1.8% of patients treated with insulin detemir compared to 0.4% of patients treated with insulin glargine had injection side reactions).
There was no difference in the variability of fasting glucose levels or the variability of glucose values of 24-hour profiles between the two treatment groups.
From the retrieved trials it was not possible to draw conclusions on the effects of these two insulins on quality of life, their costs or on the number of fatalities. Only one trial reported results on health-related quality of life and showed no significant differences between treatment groups.
Our analyses suggest that there is no clinically relevant difference in the efficacy or the safety between the use of insulin detemir and insulin glargine for treating type 2 diabetes mellitus.

5e0a2f6377f8652c6fc3f887,static_1,Collaborative care for people with depression and anxiety,"Common mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety, are estimated to affect up to 15% of the UK population at any one time, and health care systems worldwide need to implement interventions to reduce the impact and burden of these conditions; collaborative care is a complex intervention based on chronic disease management models that may be effective in the management of these common mental health problems. To assess the effectiveness of collaborative care for patients with depression or anxiety, we searched databases to February 2012, including The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group (CCDAN) trials registers (CCDANCTR-References and CCDANCTR-Studies) which include relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from MEDLINE (1950 to present), EMBASE (1974 to present), PsycINFO (1967 to present) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, all years), as well as the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal (ICTRP), ClinicalTrials.gov, and CINAHL (to November 2010 only), and we screened the reference lists of reports of all included studies and published systematic reviews for reports of additional studies. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of collaborative care for participants of all ages with depression or anxiety were included; two independent researchers extracted data using a standardised data extraction sheet, made 'Risk of bias' assessments using criteria from The Cochrane Collaboration, combined continuous measures of outcome using standardised mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), combined dichotomous measures using risk ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs, and conducted sensitivity analyses to test robustness. We included seventy-nine RCTs (including 90 relevant comparisons) involving 24,308 participants in the review, and studies varied in terms of risk of bias. The results of primary analyses demonstrated significantly greater improvement in depression outcomes for adults with depression treated with the collaborative care model in the short-term (SMD -0.34, 95% CI -0.41 to -0.27; RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.43), medium-term (SMD -0.28, 95% CI -0.41 to -0.15; RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.48), and long-term (SMD -0.35, 95% CI -0.46 to -0.24; RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.41); however, these significant benefits were not demonstrated into the very long-term (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.27). The results also demonstrated significantly greater improvement in anxiety outcomes for adults with anxiety treated with the collaborative care model in the short-term (SMD -0.30, 95% CI -0.44 to -0.17; RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.87), medium-term (SMD -0.33, 95% CI -0.47 to -0.19; RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.69), and long-term (SMD -0.20, 95% CI -0.34 to -0.06; RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.42); no comparisons examined the effects of the intervention on anxiety outcomes in the very long-term. There was evidence of benefit in secondary outcomes including medication use, mental health quality of life, and patient satisfaction, although there was less evidence of benefit in physical quality of life. Collaborative care is associated with significant improvement in depression and anxiety outcomes compared with usual care, and represents a useful addition to clinical pathways for adult patients with depression and anxiety.","Many people suffer from depression and anxiety, and these problems can make people feel sad, scared and even suicidal, and can affect their work, their relationships and their quality of life; depression and anxiety can occur because of personal, financial, social or health problems. Collaborative care is an innovative way of treating depression and anxiety and involves a number of health professionals working with a patient to help them overcome their problems; it often involves a medical doctor, a case manager (with training in depression and anxiety), and a mental health specialist such as a psychiatrist, with the case manager having regular contact with the person and organising care together with the medical doctor and specialist, and offering help with medication or access to a talking therapy to help the patient get better. Collaborative care has been tested with patients in a number of countries and health care systems, but it is not clear whether it should be recommended for people with depression or anxiety. In this review we found 79 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (90 comparisons) including 24,308 patients worldwide, comparing collaborative care with routine care or alternative treatments (such as consultation-liaison) for depression and anxiety; there were problems with the methods in some of the studies, for example, the methods used to allocate patients to collaborative care or routine care were not always free from bias, and many patients did not complete follow-up or provide information about their outcomes. Most of the studies focused on depression and the evidence suggests that collaborative care is better than routine care in improving depression for up to two years; a smaller number of studies examined the effect of collaborative care on anxiety and the evidence suggests that collaborative care is also better than usual care in improving anxiety for up to two years. Collaborative care increases the number of patients using medication in line with current guidance, and can improve mental health related quality of life, and patients with depression and anxiety treated with collaborative care are also more satisfied with their treatment.",1114,collaborative care; chronic disease management models; mental health problems; depression outcomes; anxiety outcomes; medication use; mental health quality of life; patient satisfaction; physical quality of life; clinical pathways,Why is there uncertainty about recommending collaborative care for depression and anxiety?,In what ways can collaborative care enhance the treatment of depression and anxiety?,Select the items that are animals,What are the common issues targeted by collaborative care?,How does collaborative care compare with routine care in managing depression?,The impact on very long-term outcomes is unclear.; The intervention is clearly less effective than routine care.; The number of health professionals involved makes it impractical.,The impact on very long-term outcomes is unclear.,By increasing the use of medication in line with guidelines.; By improving long-term physical quality of life.; By reducing the need for professional involvement.,By increasing the use of medication in line with guidelines.,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,Depression and anxiety; Cardiovascular diseases; Infectious diseases,Depression and anxiety,Collaborative care is better at improving depression outcomes; Routine care is more effective; Both have similar effects,Collaborative care is better at improving depression outcomes
5e0a2f6377f8652c6fc3f887,static_2,Exercise training for bronchiectasis,"Bronchiectasis is characterised by excessive sputum production, chronic cough, and acute exacerbations and is associated with symptoms of dyspnoea and fatigue, which reduce exercise tolerance and impair quality of life. Exercise training in isolation or in conjunction with other interventions is beneficial for people with other respiratory diseases, but its effects in bronchiectasis have not been well established.
To determine effects of exercise training compared to usual care on exercise tolerance (primary outcome), quality of life (primary outcome), incidence of acute exacerbation and hospitalisation, respiratory and mental health symptoms, physical function, mortality, and adverse events in people with stable or acute exacerbation of bronchiectasis.
We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Specialised Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization trials portal, from their inception to October 2020. We reviewed respiratory conference abstracts and reference lists of all primary studies and review articles for additional references.
We included randomised controlled trials in which exercise training of at least four weeks' duration (or eight sessions) was compared to usual care for people with stable bronchiectasis or experiencing an acute exacerbation. Co-interventions with exercise training including education, respiratory muscle training, and airway clearance therapy were permitted if also applied as part of usual care.
Two review authors independently screened and selected trials for inclusion, extracted outcome data, and assessed risk of bias. We contacted study authors for missing data. We calculated mean differences (MDs) using a random-effects model. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence.
We included six studies, two of which were published as abstracts, with a total of 275 participants. Five studies were undertaken with people with clinically stable bronchiectasis, and one pilot study was undertaken post acute exacerbation. All studies included co-interventions such as instructions for airway clearance therapy and/or breathing strategies, provision of an educational booklet, and delivery of educational sessions. The duration of training ranged from six to eight weeks, with a mix of supervised and unsupervised sessions conducted in the outpatient or home setting. No studies of children were included in the review; however we identified two studies as currently ongoing. No data were available regarding physical activity levels or adverse events. For people with stable bronchiectasis, evidence suggests that exercise training compared to usual care improves functional exercise tolerance as measured by the incremental shuttle walk distance, with a mean difference (MD) between groups of 87 metres (95% confidence interval (CI) 43 to 132 metres; 4 studies, 161 participants; low-certainty evidence). Evidence also suggests that exercise training improves six-minute walk distance (6MWD) (MD between groups of 42 metres, 95% CI 22 to 62; 1 study, 76 participants; low-certainty evidence). The magnitude of these observed mean changes appears clinically relevant as they exceed minimal clinically important difference (MCID) thresholds for people with chronic lung disease. Evidence suggests that quality of life improves following exercise training according to St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score (MD -9.62 points, 95% CI -15.67 to -3.56 points; 3 studies, 160 participants; low-certainty evidence), which exceeds the MCID of 4 points for this outcome. A reduction in dyspnoea (MD 1.0 points, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.53; 1 study, 76 participants) and fatigue (MD 1.51 points, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.22 points; 1 study, 76 participants) was observed following exercise training according to these domains of the Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire. However, there was no change in cough-related quality of life as measured by the Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ) (MD -0.09 points, 95% CI -0.98 to 0.80 points; 2 studies, 103 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), nor in anxiety or depression. Two studies reported longer-term outcomes up to 12 months after intervention completion; however exercise training did not appear to improve exercise capacity or quality of life more than usual care. Exercise training reduced the number of acute exacerbations of bronchiectasis over 12 months in people with stable bronchiectasis (odds ratio 0.26, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.81; 1 study, 55 participants). After an acute exacerbation of bronchiectasis, data from a single study (N = 27) suggest that exercise training compared to usual care confers little to no effect on exercise capacity (MD 11 metres, 95% CI -27 to 49 metres; low-certainty evidence), SGRQ total score (MD 6.34 points, 95%CI -17.08 to 29.76 points), or LCQ score (MD -0.08 points, 95% CI -0.94 to 0.78 points; low-certainty evidence) and does not reduce the time to first exacerbation (hazard ratio 0.83, 95% CI 0.31 to 2.22).
This review provides low-certainty evidence suggesting improvement in functional exercise capacity and quality of life immediately following exercise training in people with stable bronchiectasis; however the effects of exercise training on cough-related quality of life and psychological symptoms appear to be minimal. Due to inadequate reporting of methods, small study numbers, and variation between study findings, evidence is of very low to moderate certainty. Limited evidence is available to show longer-term effects of exercise training on these outcomes.","We wanted to know whether exercise training improves exercise tolerance, quality of life, or symptoms, and whether it reduces the number of future flare-ups (exacerbations) in people with bronchiectasis compared to those who did not participate in exercise training. We examined studies involving people with stable disease as well as those recovering from a recent flare-up, aiming to include evidence for both children and adults, although no studies involving children were found. Bronchiectasis causes chronic cough and sputum production, and people with this condition have an increased risk of exacerbations that worsen exercise tolerance and quality of life. While exercise training benefits people with other chronic lung conditions, its effects in bronchiectasis are less well understood. The evidence is current up to October 2020 and includes six studies with 275 participants, five of which involved people with stable disease. Exercise training was delivered alongside other treatments such as airway clearance therapy, respiratory muscle training, and education. Participants were randomly assigned to either exercise training or no exercise training. Training lasted at least six weeks and took place either in group settings or at home. None of the studies were funded by commercial companies. After completing exercise training, participants in a stable condition walked farther than those who did not train, with an average increase of 87 meters, although certainty of evidence is low. Participants also reported improved quality of life, less shortness of breath, and reduced fatigue. Moderate-certainty evidence showed that exercise training might not specifically improve cough-related symptoms, but the incidence of acute exacerbations was lower. Evidence was insufficient to determine whether the benefits lasted beyond the training period or whether exercise training increased overall physical activity.

5e0a2f6377f8652c6fc3f887,static_2,Cannabis-based medicines for cancer pain,"Pain is a common symptom in people with cancer; 30% to 50% of people with cancer will experience moderate-to-severe pain. This can have a major negative impact on their quality of life. Opioid (morphine-like) medications are commonly used to treat moderate or severe cancer pain, and are recommended for this purpose in the World Health Organization (WHO) pain treatment ladder. Pain is not sufficiently relieved by opioid medications in 10% to 15% of people with cancer. In people with insufficient relief of cancer pain, new analgesics are needed to effectively and safely supplement or replace opioids. To evaluate the benefits and harms of cannabis-based medicines, including medical cannabis, for treating pain and other symptoms in adults with cancer compared to placebo or any other established analgesic for cancer pain. We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 26 January 2023. We selected double-blind randomised, controlled trials (RCT) of medical cannabis, plant-derived and synthetic cannabis-based medicines against placebo or any other active treatment for cancer pain in adults, with any treatment duration and at least 10 participants per treatment arm. We used standard Cochrane methods. The primary outcomes were 1. proportions of participants reporting no worse than mild pain; 2. Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) of much improved or very much improved and 3. withdrawals due to adverse events. Secondary outcomes were 4. number of participants who reported pain relief of 30% or greater and overall opioid use reduced or stable; 5. number of participants who reported pain relief of 30% or greater, or 50% or greater; 6. pain intensity; 7. sleep problems; 8. depression and anxiety; 9. daily maintenance and breakthrough opioid dosage; 10. dropouts due to lack of efficacy; 11. all central nervous system adverse events. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence for each outcome. We identified 14 studies involving 1823 participants. No study assessed the proportions of participants reporting no worse than mild pain on treatment by 14 days after start of treatment. We found five RCTs assessing oromucosal nabiximols (tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD)) or THC alone involving 1539 participants with moderate or severe pain despite opioid therapy. The double-blind periods of the RCTs ranged between two and five weeks. Four studies with a parallel design and 1333 participants were available for meta-analysis. There was moderate-certainty evidence that there was no clinically relevant benefit for proportions of PGIC much or very much improved (risk difference (RD) 0.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 0.12; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 16, 95% CI 8 to 100). There was moderate-certainty evidence for no clinically relevant difference in the proportion of withdrawals due to adverse events (RD 0.04, 95% CI 0 to 0.08; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 25, 95% CI 16 to endless). There was moderate-certainty evidence for no difference between nabiximols or THC and placebo in the frequency of serious adverse events (RD 0.02, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.07). There was moderate-certainty evidence that nabiximols and THC used as add-on treatment for opioid-refractory cancer pain did not differ from placebo in reducing mean pain intensity (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.19, 95% CI -0.40 to 0.02). There was low-certainty evidence that a synthetic THC analogue (nabilone) delivered over eight weeks was not superior to placebo in reducing pain associated with chemotherapy or radiochemotherapy in people with head and neck cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (2 studies, 89 participants, qualitative analysis). Analyses of tolerability and safety were not possible for these studies. There was low-certainty evidence that synthetic THC analogues were superior to placebo (SMD -0.98, 95% CI -1.36 to -0.60), but not superior to low-dose codeine (SMD 0.03, 95% CI -0.25 to 0.32; 5 single-dose trials; 126 participants) in reducing moderate-to-severe cancer pain after cessation of previous analgesic treatment for three to four and a half hours (2 single-dose trials; 66 participants). Analyses of tolerability and safety were not possible for these studies. There was low-certainty evidence that CBD oil did not add value to specialist palliative care alone in the reduction of pain intensity in people with advanced cancer. There was no difference in the number of dropouts due to adverse events and serious adverse events (1 study, 144 participants, qualitative analysis). We found no studies using herbal cannabis. There is moderate-certainty evidence that oromucosal nabiximols and THC are ineffective in relieving moderate-to-severe opioid-refractory cancer pain. There is low-certainty evidence that nabilone is ineffective in reducing pain associated with (radio-) chemotherapy in people with head and neck cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. There is low-certainty evidence that a single dose of synthetic THC analogues is not superior to a single low-dose morphine equivalent in reducing moderate-to-severe cancer pain. There is low-certainty evidence that CBD does not add value to specialist palliative care alone in the reduction of pain in people with advanced cancer.","One person in two or three who gets cancer will have pain that becomes moderate or severe in intensity. The pain tends to get worse as the cancer progresses.
The WHO recommends taking morphine-like medicines for moderate-to-severe pain from cancer, but 1 in 6 to 10 people with cancer pain do not experience sufficient pain relief from morphine-like medicines. Several products based on the cannabis plant have been suggested as treatment for cancer pain. These products include inhaled or orally ingested herbal cannabis, and various oils, sprays or tablets containing active cannabis ingredients obtained from the plant, or made synthetically. Some people with cancer pain have reported that CbMs are effective for them, and that is often highlighted in the media.
If CbMs relieved cancer pain in people living with cancer.
If CbMs were associated with any unwanted or harmful effects.
We searched for clinical trials that examined CbMs compared to other medications to treat cancer pain in adults.
We summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as the methods and size of studies.
We found 14 studies involving 1823 people. The biggest study included 399 people and the smallest study included 10 people.
Studies were conducted in countries around the world; most (six) were based in North America.
Five studies used one dose of CbM and lasted less than one day. Other studies lasted between two and eight weeks.
Pharmaceutical companies funded seven studies.
Six studies compared a mouth spray with a plant-derived combination of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the principal psychoactive constituent of cannabis, and cannabidiol (CBD), an anti-inflammatory ingredient of cannabis, against a fake medication (placebo). Seven studies compared an artificial cannabinoid mimicking the effects of THC against placebo. Of these seven studies, two studies compared against a morphine-like medication (codeine), too. One study compared CBD against placebo.
We did not find studies with herbal cannabis.
Mouth spray with a plant-derived combination of THC and CBD was probably not better than placebo in reducing pain in people with moderate-to-severe cancer pain despite opioid treatment. Thirty-two out of 100 people reported to be much or very much improved by cannabis-based mouth spray and 23 out of 100 people with mouth spray with placebo. A total of 19 out of 100 people withdrew early because of side effects by cannabis-based mouth spray and 16 out of 100 people by mouth spray with placebo. There was no difference in serious side effects between the cannabis-based mouth spray and a placebo mouth spray.
Artificial cannabinoid mimicking the effects of THC may not be better than a fake medication in reducing pain associated with chemotherapy or radiochemotherapy in people with head and neck cancer and a certain type of lung cancer.
A single dose of an artificial cannabinoid mimicking the effects of THC may be better than a single dose of placebo, but may not differ from a single small dose of a morphine-like medication in reducing moderate-to-severe cancer pain after cessation of previous analgesic treatment for three to four and a half hours.
CBD may not add value to specialist palliative care alone in the reduction of pain in people with advanced cancer.
We found no studies with medical cannabis.
We are moderately confident in the evidence that a mouth spray with a plant-derived combination of THC and CBD does not reduce severe cancer pain despite opioid treatment because studies did not provide information about everything that we could have used.
We have little confidence in the evidence that an artificial cannabinoid mimicking the effects of THC (nabilone) does not reduce pain associated with chemotherapy or radiochemotherapy because the studies did not provide data about everything that we could have used, and because the studies were small.
We have little confidence in the evidence that artificial cannabinoids mimicking the effects of THC reduce cancer pain after the previous pain-relieving medication was stopped some hours before because the studies did not provide data about everything that we could have used, and because the studies were small.
We have little confidence in the evidence that CBD added to standard palliative care does not reduce cancer pain because there was only one study available.",1016,Opioid-refractory; oromucosal nabiximols; tetrahydrocannabinol (THC); cannabidiol (CBD); patient global impression of change (PGIC); synthetic THC analogue; analgesic treatment; chemotherapy; radiochemotherapy; adverse events,How do the study results challenge the potential use of cannabis-based medicines as alternatives to opioids for cancer pain?,What was a key motivation for the study?,Select all of the following that are colors,What was the outcome of using a mouth spray with THC and CBD for cancer pain?,"In the study, how did artificial cannabinoids perform compared to codeine?",There is no strong evidence that CbMs offer superior pain relief to opioids.; CbMs consistently showed better results than placebo.; CbMs treatments are associated with fewer side effects than opioids.,There is no strong evidence that CbMs offer superior pain relief to opioids.,To determine the effectiveness of CbMs in cancer pain relief.; To find new synthetic drugs for cancer treatment.; To evaluate the cost of cancer treatments.,To determine the effectiveness of CbMs in cancer pain relief.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,It was more effective than placebo.; It did not show significant improvement over placebo.; It cured the pain completely.,It did not show significant improvement over placebo.,They were superior in reducing pain.; They showed no difference in pain reduction.; They were less effective than codeine.,They showed no difference in pain reduction.
5e0a2f6377f8652c6fc3f887,interactive_3,Use of medication to treat depression in people with opioid dependence,"Lifetime prevalence of depression in subjects with opioid dependence is higher than in the general population (44-54% versus 16%) and represents a risk factor for morbidity and mortality. For patients on opioid agonist treatment, current prevalence rates of depression ranges between 10 and 30%, influencing negatively the outcome of the treatment. To evaluate the efficacy and the acceptability of antidepressants for the treatment of depressed opioid dependents treated with opioid agonists. We searched Pubmed, EMBASE, CINAHL (to October 2009), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library Cochrane Drug and Alcohol Group Specialised Register, issue 4, 2009), main electronic sources of ongoing trials, specific trial databases and reference lists of all relevant papers. Randomised and controlled clinical trials examining the efficacy of any antidepressant medication to treat depressed opioid dependents in treatment with opioid agonists. Two authors independently screened and extracted data from studies. Seven studies, 482 participants, met the inclusion criteria.  Comparing antidepressant with placebo, no statistically significant results for dropouts. Selecting studies with low risk of bias, 325 participants, results favour placebo, RR 1.40 (Cl 95% 1.00 to 1.96). For severity of depression, results from two studies, 183 participants, favour antidepressants utilising Clinical Global Impression Scale RR 1.92 (CI 95% 1.26 to 2.94), while another study, 95 participants, utilising the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, did not find a statistically significant difference RR 0.96 (CI 95% 0.54 to 1.71). For adverse events, result favour placebo, four studies, 311 participants, RR 2.90 (Cl 95% 1.23 to 6.86). For drug use, three studies, 211 participants, it was not possible to pool data because outcomes' measures were not comparable. Looking at singular studies, no statistically significant difference was seen. - Comparing different classes of antidepressants, the results favour tricyclics for severity of depression, two studies, 183 participants, RR 1.92 (Cl 95% 1.26 to 2.94) and favour placebo for adverse events, two studies, 172 participants, RR 3.11 (Cl 95% 1.06 to 9.12). There is low evidence, at the present, supporting the clinical use of antidepressants for the treatment of depressed opioid addicts in treatment with opioid agonists. There is a need of larger randomised studies investigating relevant outcomes, safety issues and reporting data to allow comparison of results.","There is little evidence to support the use of antidepressants for treating people who are dependent on opioids and have clinical depression. Depression is more common in people with substance abuse and dependence than in the general population. The depression experienced is also associated with an increased risk of completed suicide. Depression may represent an independent disorder, the psychosocial stress associated with addictive behavior or it could be a consequence of drug use and drug withdrawal effects. A maintenance program with opioid agonists (methadone, buprenorphine, LAAM) is an effective treatment for people who are dependent on opioids in terms of retention in treatment and reduced use of opioids. Depression is however still prevalent and negatively impacts on treatment outcomes. Treatment with antidepressant drugs has therefore been proposed. These adjunct drug treatments include tricyclic antidepressants (doxepin, desipramine, imipramine) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs fluoxetine, sertraline). Authors included seven randomised controlled studies that involved 482 participants in our review. The studies were conducted in outpatient settings over four to 16 weeks; six were in USA and one in Australia. The mean age of participants was 34 years and 62% were males. No clear difference was found in the number of dropouts from an opioid agonist maintenance program between people receiving antidepressants and those in the placebo groups. Neither was drug use different (two studies). Severity of depression was reduced with the use of antidepressants (two studies), including tricyclic antidepressants. Adverse events were important as more of the participants who received antidepressants withdrew from the studies for medical reasons compared with those participants on placebo (four studies). The differences between studies in clinical (participant characteristics, the medications used, services and treatments delivered) and methodological characteristics (study design and quality) made it difficult to draw confident conclusions about the efficacy and safety of antidepressants for the treatment of depression in people who are dependent on opioids.",1118,depression; opioid dependence; opioid agonist treatment; antidepressants; tricyclics; adverse events,How does the presence of depression influence the outcomes of opioid agonist treatments according to the study?,What criteria should future studies meet to improve evidence on the efficacy of antidepressants for opioid-dependent individuals?,Select all of the following that are colors,What is the main conclusion about antidepressant use for opioid dependents?,"In the summary, how did adverse events affect antidepressant use in the studies?",It enhances the retention of participants in treatment programs.; It negatively impacts the treatment outcomes.; It has no significant impact on treatment outcomes.,It negatively impacts the treatment outcomes.,Larger randomized trials with relevant outcome reporting.; Increased focus on drug misuse prevention.; Studies with diverse participant characteristics.,Larger randomized trials with relevant outcome reporting.; Studies with diverse participant characteristics.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Little evidence supports their use; They are highly recommended; They completely cure both addiction and depression,Little evidence supports their use,They led to more study withdrawals; They had no impact on the studies; They improved retention in studies,They led to more study withdrawals
5e0a2f6377f8652c6fc3f887,interactive_4,Is plasma from the blood of people who have recovered from COVID-19 an effective treatment for other people with COVID-19?,"Convalescent plasma may reduce mortality in patients with viral respiratory diseases, and is being investigated as a potential therapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A thorough understanding of the current body of evidence regarding benefits and risks of this intervention is required. To assess the effectiveness and safety of convalescent plasma transfusion in the treatment of people with COVID-19; and to maintain the currency of the evidence using a living systematic review approach. To identify completed and ongoing studies, we searched the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease Research Database, MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, and the Epistemonikos COVID-19 L*OVE Platform. We searched monthly until 03 March 2022. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating convalescent plasma for COVID-19, irrespective of disease severity, age, gender or ethnicity. We excluded studies that included populations with other coronavirus diseases (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)), as well as studies evaluating standard immunoglobulin. We followed standard Cochrane methodology. To assess bias in included studies we used RoB 2. We used the GRADE approach to rate the certainty of evidence for the following outcomes: all-cause mortality at up to day 28, worsening and improvement of clinical status (for individuals with moderate to severe disease), hospital admission or death, COVID-19 symptoms resolution (for individuals with mild disease), quality of life, grade 3 or 4 adverse events, and serious adverse events. In this fourth review update version, we included 33RCTs with 24,861 participants, of whom 11,432 received convalescent plasma. Of these, nine studies are single-centre studies and 24 are multi-centre studies. Fourteen studies took place in America, eight in Europe, three in South-East Asia, two in Africa, two in western Pacific and three in eastern Mediterranean regions and one in multiple regions. We identified a further 49 ongoingstudies evaluating convalescent plasma, and 33 studies reporting as being completed. Individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and moderate to severe disease 29 RCTs investigated the use of convalescent plasma for 22,728 participants with moderate to severe disease. 23 RCTs with 22,020 participants compared convalescent plasma to placebo or standard care alone, five compared to standard plasma and one compared to human immunoglobulin. We evaluate subgroups on detection of antibodies detection, symptom onset, country income groups and several co-morbidities in the full text. Convalescent plasma versus placebo or standard care alone Convalescent plasma does not reduce all-cause mortality at up to day 28 (risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92 to 1.03; 220 per 1000; 21 RCTs, 19,021 participants; high-certainty evidence). It has little to no impact on need for invasive mechanical ventilation, or death (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.11; 296 per 1000; 6 RCTs, 14,477 participants; high-certainty evidence) and has no impact on whether participants are discharged from hospital (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.02; 665 per 1000; 6 RCTs, 12,721 participants; high-certainty evidence).

Convalescent plasma may have little to no impact on the risk of grades 3 and 4 adverse events (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.42; 212 per 1000; 6 RCTs, 2392 participants; low-certainty evidence). It has probably little to no effect on the risk of serious adverse events (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.44; 135 per 1000; 6 RCTs, 3901 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Convalescent plasma versus standard plasma We are uncertain whether convalescent plasma reduces or increases all-cause mortality at up to day 28 (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.19; 129 per 1000; 4 RCTs, 484 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether convalescent plasma reduces or increases the need for invasive mechanical ventilation, or death (RR 5.59, 95% CI 0.29 to 108.38; 311 per 1000; 1 study, 34 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and whether it reduces or increases the risk of serious adverse events (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.15; 236 per 1000; 3 RCTs, 327 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We did not identify any study reporting other key outcomes. Convalescent plasma versus human immunoglobulin Convalescent plasma may have little to no effect on all-cause mortality at up to day 28 (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.50; 464 per 1000; 1 study, 190 participants; low-certainty evidence). We did not identify any study reporting other key outcomes. Individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and mild disease We identified two RCTs reporting on 536 participants, comparing convalescent plasma to placebo or standard care alone, and two RCTs reporting on 1597 participants with mild disease, comparing convalescent plasma to standard plasma. Convalescent plasma versus placebo or standard care alone We are uncertain whether convalescent plasma reduces all-cause mortality at up to day 28 (odds ratio (OR) 0.36, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.46; 8 per 1000; 2 RCTs, 536 participants; very low-certainty evidence). It may have little to no effect on admission to hospital or death within 28 days (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.84; 117 per 1000; 1 RCT, 376 participants; low-certainty evidence), on time to COVID-19 symptom resolution (hazard ratio (HR) 1.05, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.30; 483 per 1000; 1 RCT, 376 participants; low-certainty evidence), on the risk of grades 3 and 4 adverse events (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.75 to 2.19; 144 per 1000; 1 RCT, 376 participants; low-certainty evidence) and the risk of serious adverse events (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.94; 133 per 1000; 1 RCT, 376 participants; low-certainty evidence). We did not identify any study reporting other key outcomes. Convalescent plasma versus standard plasma We are uncertain whether convalescent plasma reduces all-cause mortality at up to day 28 (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.75; 2 per 1000; 2 RCTs, 1597 participants; very low-certainty evidence). It probably reduces admission to hospital or death within 28 days (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.75; 36 per 1000; 2 RCTs, 1595 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Convalescent plasma may have little to no effect on initial symptom resolution at up to day 28 (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.27; 1 RCT, 416 participants; low-certainty evidence). We did not identify any study reporting other key outcomes. This is a living systematic review. We search monthly for new evidence and update the review when we identify relevant new evidence. For the comparison of convalescent plasma versus placebo or standard care alone, our certainty in the evidence that convalescent plasma for individuals with moderate to severe disease does not reduce mortality and has little to no impact on clinical improvement or worsening is high. It probably has little to no effect on SAEs. For individuals with mild disease, we have very-low to low certainty evidence for most primary outcomes and moderate certainty for hospital admission or death. There are 49 ongoing studies, and 33 studies reported as complete in a trials registry. Publication of ongoing studies might resolve some of the uncertainties around convalescent plasma therapy for people with asymptomatic or mild disease.","Convalescent plasma is plasma containing antibodies produced by the body as a defence against infection, taken from people who have recovered from COVID-19 and used to make treatment that can be given by a drip or injection; while generally well-tolerated, it can cause unwanted effects. We wanted to find out whether convalescent plasma is an effective treatment for people with confirmed COVID-19, looking at deaths from any cause after treatment, worsening of patients' condition measured by the number of people needing ventilator support or who died, improvement measured by hospital discharge, quality of life, and unwanted effects. We searched for studies worldwide that investigated convalescent plasma in people of any age, gender, ethnicity, and with mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19, pooled results when possible, and rated our confidence based on study methods and sizes. We found 33 studies with 24,861 participants, including 29 studies in moderate to severe COVID-19 and four in mild disease, mostly conducted in hospitals worldwide; the findings compare convalescent plasma with placebo or standard care. For people with moderate to severe COVID-19, convalescent plasma makes no difference to deaths within 28 days (about 225 in 1000 died vs 220 in 1000 given plasma), makes little to no difference in needing invasive mechanical ventilation or dying (287 in 1000 vs 296 in 1000), and makes no difference to being discharged from hospital (665 in 1000 in both groups). It probably makes no difference to serious unwanted effects (118 in 1000 vs 133 in 1000) and may result in no difference in quality of life. For people with mild COVID-19, convalescent plasma may result in no difference in deaths within 28 days (22 in 1000 on placebo/standard care vs 9 in 1000 on plasma), may result in no difference in admission to hospital or death within 28 days (112 in 1000 vs 117 in 1000), may result in no difference in the time until symptoms resolved, and may result in no difference in serious unwanted effects. The limitations of the evidence are that we are very confident in the evidence for deaths, worsening, and improvement in moderate to severe COVID-19 due to consistent high-quality studies, but confidence in other evidence for moderate, severe, and mild COVID-19 is limited because we could not identify enough consistent results; there is still little evidence on quality of life and for people with mild disease, and none for those without COVID-19 symptoms.",1108,Convalescent plasma; viral respiratory diseases; coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS); Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS); RoB 2; mechanical ventilation; quality of life; human immunoglobulin; SARS-CoV-2 infection,What inference can be drawn about the impact of convalescent plasma on deaths within 28 days for patients with moderate to severe COVID-19?,What is the estimated effectiveness of convalescent plasma in improving the quality of life for patients with moderate to severe COVID-19?,Select all of the following that are colors,What conclusion can be drawn about the unwanted effects of convalescent plasma therapy for moderate to severe COVID-19?,What hypothesis could be formulated for further studies to resolve uncertainties about convalescent plasma in asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 cases?,"Convalescent plasma significantly reduces mortality.; Convalescent plasma has no impact on mortality compared to placebo or standard care.; The evidence shows mixed results, making it inconclusive.",Convalescent plasma has no impact on mortality compared to placebo or standard care.,The plasma significantly improves quality of life.; There is little to no difference in quality of life compared to standard care.; The evidence on quality of life was robust and conclusive.,There is little to no difference in quality of life compared to standard care.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Convalescent plasma likely increases serious unwanted effects.; The therapy probably makes no difference in the occurrence of serious unwanted effects.; The therapy has a clear difference in reducing unwanted effects.,The therapy probably makes no difference in the occurrence of serious unwanted effects.,Convalescent plasma significantly enhances symptom resolution.; Further large-scale studies will clarify its impact on mild cases.; More randomised trials are unnecessary based on current evidence.,Further large-scale studies will clarify its impact on mild cases.
5e0a2f6377f8652c6fc3f887,interactive_4,Long-term treatment for people with persistent depression,"Persistent depressive disorder (PDD) is defined as a depressive disorder with a minimum illness duration of two years, including four diagnostic subgroups (dysthymia, chronic major depression, recurrent major depression with incomplete remission between episodes, and double depression), and persistent forms of depression represent a substantial proportion of depressive disorders, with a lifetime prevalence ranging from 3% to 6% in the Western world; growing evidence indicates that PDD responds well to several acute interventions, such as combined psychological and pharmacological treatments, yet given the high rates of relapse and recurrences of depression following response to acute treatment, long-term continuation and maintenance therapy are of great importance, and to date there has been no evidence synthesis available on continuation and maintenance treatments of PDDs. The aim of this review was to assess the effects of pharmacological and psychological (either alone or combined) continuation and maintenance treatments for persistent depressive disorder, in comparison with each other, placebo (drug/attention placebo/non-specific treatment control), and treatment as usual (TAU), with continuation treatments defined as treatments given to currently remitted people (remission is defined as depressive symptoms dropping below case level) or to people who previously responded to an antidepressant treatment, and maintenance therapy given during recovery (defined as remission lasting longer than six months). We searched Ovid MEDLINE (1950- ), Embase (1974- ), PsycINFO (1967- ) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to 28 September 2018, with an earlier search of these databases also conducted via the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trial Register (CCMD-CTR) to 11 December 2015; in addition we searched grey literature resources, ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP to 28 September 2018, screened reference lists of included studies, and contacted the first author of included studies. We included randomized (RCTs) and non-randomized controlled trials (NRCTs) in adults with formally diagnosed PDD, receiving pharmacological, psychological, or combined continuation and maintenance interventions. Two review authors independently selected studies and extracted and analyzed data; the primary efficacy outcome was relapse/recurrence rate of depression, and the primary acceptance outcome was dropout due to any reason other than relapse/recurrence; we performed random-effects meta-analyses using risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We included 10 studies (seven RCTs, three NRCTs) involving 840 participants, with five studies investigating continuation treatments and five investigating maintenance treatments; overall, the included studies were at low-to-moderate risk of bias, with the most common source of risk of bias in NRCTs being selection of reported results, and in RCTs non-blinding of outcome assessment and other bias (especially conflict of interest due to pharmaceutical sponsoring). The most common comparison was antidepressant medication versus tablet placebo (five studies), and participants taking antidepressant medication were probably less likely to relapse or to experience a recurrent episode compared to participants in the placebo group at the end of the intervention (13.9% versus 33.8%, RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.79; participants = 383; studies = 4;  I²  = 54%, moderate quality evidence); overall dropout rates may be similar between participants in the medication and placebo group (23.0% versus 25.5%, RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.39 to 2.11; RCTs = 4; participants = 386;  I²  = 64%, low quality evidence), although sensitivity analyses showed that the primary outcome (rate of relapse/recurrence) showed no evidence of a difference between groups when only including studies with low risk of bias. None of the studies compared pharmacological or psychological treatments versus TAU. One study compared psychological therapies versus attention placebo/non-specific control, and one study compared psychotherapy with medication; the results of the studies including psychotherapy might indicate that continued or maintained psychotherapy could be a useful intervention compared to no treatment or antidepressant medication, but the body of evidence for these comparisons was too small and uncertain to draw high quality conclusions. Three studies compared combined psychological and pharmacological therapies with pharmacological therapies alone, and one study compared combined psychological and pharmacological therapies with psychotherapeutic therapies alone; however, the evidence was too small and uncertain to draw any high quality conclusions. Two studies reported data on the direct comparison of two antidepressants, but again the evidence was too small and uncertain to draw conclusions. Currently, it is uncertain whether continued or maintained pharmacotherapy (or both) with the reviewed antidepressant agents is a robust treatment for preventing relapse and recurrence in people with PDD due to moderate or high risk of bias as well as clinical heterogeneity in the analyzed studies; for all other comparisons, the body of evidence was too small to draw any final conclusions, although continued or maintained psychotherapy might be effective compared to no treatment. There is a need for more high quality trials of psychological interventions, and further studies should address health-related quality of life and adverse events more precisely, as well as assessing follow-up data.","Depressive disorders that persist for at least two years cause considerable problems; even after successful treatment, they frequently recur, and common treatments are antidepressant medicines and psychological treatments (talking therapies), or a combination of both, with long-term treatments intended to prevent the recurrence of depressive symptoms. People with persisting depression (longer than two years), friends, families, and carers, as well as general practitioners, psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, psychological therapists, and pharmacists, will be interested in this review. In adults with persistent depression who improved with acute (short-term) treatment, the review aimed to determine whether receiving continued antidepressant medicine, psychological treatment, or a combination of both is more effective in preventing recurrence of depression compared to placebo (a pretended treatment) or care as usual; whether receiving continued antidepressant medicine, psychological treatment, or a combination of both is equally accepted as receiving placebo or usual care; and whether one treatment is more effective or more accepted than another. We searched medical databases and other sources to find all relevant studies completed up to September 2018, and the studies had to compare antidepressant treatment, psychological treatment, or a combination of both, with each other, with placebo, or with care as usual for preventing recurrence of depression in adults diagnosed with persistent depression; we included 10 studies involving 840 participants. Five studies compared antidepressant medicine with placebo; one study compared psychological therapies versus attention placebo/non-specific control; one study compared psychotherapy with medication; three studies compared combined psychological and pharmacological therapies with pharmacological therapies alone; one study compared combined psychological and pharmacological therapies with psychotherapeutic therapies alone; and two studies compared two different antidepressants with each other. Overall, the included studies were at low-to-moderate risk of bias. According to GRADE, there was moderate quality evidence that participants taking medication treatment probably had less relapses/recurrences and may have lower dropouts than those taking placebo; the risk of depression returning in participants receiving a placebo (instead of antidepressant medicine) was 34%, whereas participants who remained on antidepressant medicines had a lower risk for recurrence of 13%, with continued treatment lasting between four months and two years. Antidepressants were as well accepted as placebo; however, as most of the included studies showed risk of bias and there were some inconsistent results between the different studies, it cannot be concluded with certainty whether continued or maintained pharmacotherapy (or both) is a convincing treatment for people with PDD. Additionally, as studies on the long-term effects of medication are lacking, recommendations on the necessary duration of medication treatment cannot be drawn. The benefits of psychological therapies or combined treatment remained unclear due to the small number of studies. This review cannot provide clear, certain evidence regarding whether continued antidepressant medication (compared to placebo tablet) reduces the risk of depression recurring in adults with persistent depression; however, only a few studies have been done, and further studies should especially address psychological and combined long-term treatments.",1116,Persistent depressive disorder; acute interventions; remission; continuation and maintenance therapy; psychotherapy,What might be the implications of the study's findings for the long-term management of persistent depressive disorder (PDD)?,What is the primary focus of the study?,Select all of the following that are fruits,Which treatments were compared in the study?,How are long-term treatments intended to benefit patients with persistent depression?,Continued antidepressant medication offers a definitive solution to prevent recurrence.; Psychotherapy could potentially be more effective but requires further research.; There is uncertainty regarding the efficacy of combined treatments due to limited data.,Psychotherapy could potentially be more effective but requires further research.; There is uncertainty regarding the efficacy of combined treatments due to limited data.,Assessing continuation and maintenance treatments for persistent depression; Investigating new antidepressant medications; Studying short-term interventions for depression,Assessing continuation and maintenance treatments for persistent depression,dog; blue; grape,grape,Antidepressant medications versus placebo; Psychological therapies versus attention placebo; Lifestyle interventions versus exercise,Antidepressant medications versus placebo; Psychological therapies versus attention placebo,Preventing recurrence of depressive symptoms; Eliminating depressive symptoms completely; Providing immediate relief from symptoms,Preventing recurrence of depressive symptoms
5e0a2f6377f8652c6fc3f887,finetuned_5,Ivermectin for preventing and treating COVID-19,"Ivermectin, an antiparasitic agent, inhibits the replication of viruses in vitro, and the molecular hypothesis of its antiviral mode of action suggests an inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2 replication in early stages of infection, although current evidence on ivermectin for prevention of infection and treatment of COVID-19 is conflicting. The objective was to assess the efficacy and safety of ivermectin plus standard of care compared to standard of care plus or minus placebo, or any other proven intervention, for people with COVID-19 receiving inpatient or outpatient treatment, and for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection as postexposure prophylaxis. We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, Web of Science, WHO COVID-19 Global literature, and the HTA database weekly without language restrictions to 16 December 2021, and additionally included trials with more than 1000 participants up to April 2022. We included randomized controlled trials comparing ivermectin to standard of care, placebo, or another proven intervention for treatment of confirmed COVID-19, irrespective of disease severity or setting, and for prevention of infection, with co-interventions required to be the same in both groups; in this update we reappraised eligible trials for research integrity, including only prospectively registered RCTs according to WHO guidelines. We assessed RCTs for bias using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool and used GRADE to rate certainty of evidence for outcomes in inpatients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19, outpatients with mild COVID-19, and for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We excluded seven of the 14 trials from the previous review because six were not prospectively registered and one was non-randomized; the updated review includes 11 trials with 3409 participants investigating ivermectin plus standard of care compared to standard of care plus or minus placebo. No trial investigated ivermectin for prevention or compared it to an intervention with proven efficacy. Five trials treated moderate COVID-19 in inpatient settings and six treated mild COVID-19 in outpatient settings; eight trials were double-blind and placebo-controlled, and three were open-label, with around 50% of results assessed as low risk of bias. We identified 31 ongoing trials and 28 potentially eligible trials without published results or with reporting disparities, held in awaiting classification until authors clarify details. For treating moderate-to-severe inpatient COVID-19, we are uncertain whether ivermectin plus standard of care reduces or increases all-cause mortality at 28 days (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.14 to 2.51; 3 trials, 230 participants; very low-certainty evidence), clinical worsening measured by new need for ventilation or death (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.33 to 2.04; 2 trials, 118 participants; very low-certainty evidence), or serious adverse events (RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.07 to 35.89; 2 trials, 197 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Ivermectin plus standard of care may have little or no effect on clinical improvement measured by discharge alive at day 28 (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.35; 1 trial, 73 participants; low-certainty evidence), on any adverse events during the trial (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.79; 3 trials, 228 participants; low-certainty evidence), and on viral clearance at seven days (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.58; 3 trials, 231 participants; low-certainty evidence); no trial investigated quality of life. For treating outpatients with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19, ivermectin plus standard of care probably has little or no effect on all-cause mortality at day 28 (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.25; 6 trials, 2860 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and little or no effect on quality of life measured with the PROMIS Global-10 scale (physical and mental component MD 0.00, 95% CI ranges crossing 0; 1358 participants; high-certainty evidence). Ivermectin may have little or no effect on clinical worsening measured by hospital admission or death (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.20 to 6.02; 2 trials, 590 participants; low-certainty evidence), clinical improvement measured by resolution of symptoms by day 14 (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.36; 2 trials, 478 participants; low-certainty evidence), serious adverse events (RR 2.27, 95% CI 0.62 to 8.31; 5 trials, 1502 participants; low-certainty evidence), any adverse events (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.76; 5 trials, 1502 participants; low-certainty evidence), and viral clearance at day 7 (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.48; 2 trials, 331 participants; low-certainty evidence); no trials reporting duration of symptoms were eligible for meta-analysis. For outpatients, there is currently low- to high-certainty evidence that ivermectin has no beneficial effect for people with COVID-19, and based on very low-certainty evidence for inpatients, we remain uncertain whether ivermectin prevents death or clinical worsening or increases serious adverse events, while low-certainty evidence suggests no beneficial effect on clinical improvement, viral clearance, or adverse events; no evidence is available for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this update, certainty increased due to higher-quality trials with more participants, and according to the living review approach, searches will continue to be updated.","Ivermectin is a medicine used to treat parasites, such as intestinal parasites in animals and scabies in humans, and is inexpensive and widely used where parasitic infestations are common, with few unwanted effects; medical regulators have not approved ivermectin for COVID-19. We wanted to update our knowledge of whether ivermectin reduces death, illness, and length of infection in people with COVID-19, or is useful in prevention, and included trials comparing the medicine to placebo, usual care, or treatments known to work to some extent such as dexamethasone, while excluding trials comparing ivermectin to medicines that do not work, like hydroxychloroquine, or whose effectiveness is uncertain. We evaluated effects of ivermectin in infected people on people dying, whether COVID-19 got better or worse, quality of life, serious and non-serious unwanted effects, and viral clearance; for prevention, we sought effects on preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease. We searched for randomized controlled trials investigating ivermectin to prevent or treat COVID-19, requiring laboratory-confirmed infections for hospital or outpatient participants, and in this update also investigated trustworthiness of trials, including them only if they fulfilled clear ethical and scientific criteria; we compared and summarized results and rated confidence in the evidence based on common criteria such as trial methods and sizes. We excluded seven of the 14 trials from the previous review as they did not fulfil expected criteria, and with four new trials included 11 trials with 3409 participants investigating ivermectin with usual care compared with the same usual care or placebo; for treatment, five trials were in hospital with moderate COVID-19 and six trials in outpatients with mild COVID-19, using different doses and treatment durations, and no trial investigated ivermectin for prevention; we also found 31 ongoing trials and 28 additional trials requiring clarification or not yet published. Treating people in hospital with COVID-19, we do not know whether ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment leads to more or fewer deaths, worsens or improves condition measured by need for ventilation or death, or increases or reduces serious unwanted events; ivermectin may make little or no difference to improving condition measured by discharge or to non-serious unwanted events, and seven days after treatment may make little or no difference to reduction of negative tests. Treating outpatients with COVID-19, ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment probably makes little or no difference to people dying and makes little or no difference to quality of life; it may make little or no difference to worsening condition measured by admission or death, serious unwanted events, non-serious unwanted events, improvement of symptoms in 14 days, or negative tests at seven days. Our confidence in the evidence, especially for outpatients, improved since the last review because more participants were included in high-quality trials, and although we are quite certain about risk of dying and quality of life, confidence is still low for many other outcomes because few events were measured, methods differed, and not all relevant outcomes were reported.",1109,Ivermectin; SARS-CoV-2; antiparasitic agent; postexposure prophylaxis; co-interventions; WHO guidelines; all-cause mortality; serious adverse events; clinical improvement; viral clearance,How could the exclusion of certain trials from the analysis impact the confidence in the study's conclusions?,What are the implications of finding little or no effect of ivermectin on the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients?,Select all of the following that are colors,"Considering the studyÃ¢ÂÂs findings, how might future research on ivermectin's use in COVID-19 treatment be designed?",What was the main objective of the study discussed in the summary?,It increases confidence by ensuring higher-quality evidence; It decreases confidence as fewer trials are considered; It has no impact since only reliable data is excluded,It increases confidence by ensuring higher-quality evidence,Ivermectin should not be used as a standard treatment for COVID-19; Ivermectin should be used in combination with other treatments; The use of ivermectin is justified in certain emergency situations,Ivermectin should not be used as a standard treatment for COVID-19,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,"Focus on larger-scale, high-quality, double-blind trials; Incorporate non-randomized participants to increase diversity; Reduce the number of placebo controls to simplify results","Focus on larger-scale, high-quality, double-blind trials",To assess the efficacy and safety of ivermectin compared to standard care.; To measure the economic impact of ivermectin.; To develop new antiparasitic drugs.,To assess the efficacy and safety of ivermectin compared to standard care.
5e0a2f6377f8652c6fc3f887,finetuned_6,Best therapy for people with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who have not been treated without a targetable mutation and moderately impaired performance status,"Most people who are newly diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have advanced disease. For these people, survival is determined by various patient- and tumor-related factors, of which the performance status (PS) is the most important prognostic factor. People with PS 0 or 1 are usually treated with systemic therapies, whereas people with PS 3 or 4 most often receive supportive care. However, treatment for people with PS 2 without a targetable mutation remains unclear. Historically, people with a PS 2 cancer are frequently excluded from (important) clinical trials because of poorer outcomes and increased toxicity. We aim to address this knowledge gap, as this group of people represents a significant proportion (20% to 30%) of the total population with newly diagnosed lung cancer.
To identify the best first-line therapy for advanced lung cancer in people with performance status 2 without a targetable mutation or with an unknown mutation status.
We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. 
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared different chemotherapy (with or without angiogenesis inhibitor) or immunotherapy regimens, specifically designed for people with PS 2 only or studies including a subgroup of these people.
We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. overall survival (OS), 2. health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and 3. toxicity/adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were 4. tumor response rate, 5. progression-free survival, and 6. survival rates at six and 12 months' treatment. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence for each outcome.
We included 22 trials in this review and identified one ongoing trial. Twenty studies compared chemotherapy with different regimens, of which 11 compared non-platinum therapy (monotherapy or doublet) versus platinum doublet. We found no studies comparing best supportive care with chemotherapy and only two abstracts analyzing chemotherapy versus immunotherapy. We found that platinum doublet therapy showed superior OS compared to non-platinum therapy (hazard ratio [HR] 0.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.57 to 0.78; 7 trials, 697 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There were no differences in six-month survival rates (risk ratio [RR] 1.00, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.41; 6 trials, 632 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), whereas 12-month survival rates were improved for treatment with platinum doublet therapy (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.87 to 0.97; 11 trials, 1567 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). PFS and tumor response rate were also better for people treated with platinum doublet therapy, with moderate-certainty evidence (PFS: HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.77; 5 trials, 487 participants; tumor response rate: RR 2.25, 95% CI 1.67 to 3.05; 9 trials, 964 participants). When analyzing toxicity rates, we found that platinum doublet therapy increased grade 3 to 5 hematologic toxicities, all with low-certainty evidence (anemia: RR 1.98, 95% CI 1.00 to 3.92; neutropenia: RR 2.75, 95% CI 1.30 to 5.82; thrombocytopenia: RR 3.96, 95% CI 1.73 to 9.06; all 8 trials, 935 participants). Only four trials reported HRQoL data; however, the methodology was different per trial and we were unable to perform a meta-analysis. Although evidence is limited, there were no differences in 12-month survival rates or tumor response rates between carboplatin and cisplatin regimens. With an indirect comparison, carboplatin seemed to have better 12-month survival rates than cisplatin compared to non-platinum therapy. The assessment of the efficacy of immunotherapy in people with PS 2 was limited. There might be a place for single-agent immunotherapy, but the data provided by the included studies did not encourage the use of double-agent immunotherapy.
This review showed that as a first-line treatment for people with PS 2 with advanced NSCLC, platinum doublet therapy seems to be preferred over non-platinum therapy, with a higher response rate, PFS, and OS. Although the risk for grade 3 to 5 hematologic toxicity is higher, these events are often relatively mild and easy to treat. Since trials using checkpoint inhibitors in people with PS 2 are scarce, we identified an important knowledge gap regarding their role in people with advanced NSCLC and PS 2.","Lung cancer is the most frequent cause of cancer-related death worldwide and NSCLC is the most common subtype. At the time of diagnosis, the disease has already spread in more than half of all cases. In the tumors of a minority of people diagnosed with NSCLC that has spread to other parts of the body specific mutations can be found, which are treated distinct from the majority of people without such mutations.
NSCLC can only be treated with life-prolonging medicines such as chemotherapy (a medicine used to destroy cancer cells) or immunotherapy (a medicine that boosts the person's immune system and helps the body find and destroy cancer cells). Selecting the best treatment depends on the health condition of the person. That condition is determined using a scale from 0 (no symptoms) to 5 (dead). There is no discussion on the treatment of relatively fit people (scoring 0 or 1), as they often tolerate these treatments relatively well. People with a low health condition (scoring 3 or 4) receive only supportive care in most cases. However, although representing 20% to 30% of all people, the best treatment for moderately impaired people (PS 2) is not clear, as they often do not participate in trials.
Our objective was to investigate the best therapy for people with advanced NSCLC without a specific mutation with PS 2.
We searched medical databases for clinical trials comparing treatments for advanced NSCLC with best supportive care or other treatments.
We found 22 trials; 20 compared different types of chemotherapy and two compared chemotherapy versus immunotherapy.
People treated with chemotherapy regimens using two medicines, including a platinum-based medicine, had longer survival than people treated with chemotherapies without a platinum-based medicine. However, these people did have more side effects, especially with a negative influence on the bone marrow (matter found in the center of bones), resulting in a temporary lack of red and white blood cells, and platelets. The few studies that analyzed health-related quality of life all used different methods of measurement. We found no difference in quality of life when we looked at those studies individually. We found two partly published trials studying immunotherapy, which found no survival benefit compared to chemotherapy.
We are moderately confident in our results that chemotherapies with a platinum-based medicine increases survival. We are also moderately confident in the evidence evaluating the time to progression of disease because in all included studies, both investigators and trial participants were fully aware of which treatment the participants received. This might lead to substantial bias. In addition, we have little confidence in the evidence regarding toxicities because the evidence is based on a small number of studies with conflicting outcomes.",1023,non-small cell lung cancer; performance status; targetable mutation; immunotherapy regimens; overall survival; health-related quality of life; progression-free survival; tumor response rate; platinum doublet therapy; hematologic toxicities,What are the underlying motivations for focusing on people with performance status 2 in the study of NSCLC treatments?,How did the study distinguish between the effects of platinum-based chemotherapy versus non-platinum regimens?,Select the items that are animals,Critique the robustness of the studyÃ¢ÂÂs conclusions regarding immunotherapy for PS 2 patients.,What is the primary aim of the study discussed in the plain-language summary?,"They often tolerate treatment well, similar to those with PS 0 or 1.; They represent a significant but often neglected portion of NSCLC cases.; They are frequently included in clinical trials, which simplifies research.",They represent a significant but often neglected portion of NSCLC cases.,It demonstrated improved survival outcomes with platinum-based regimens.; It showed no difference in tumor response rates.; It highlighted consistent quality of life improvements with non-platinum regimens.,It demonstrated improved survival outcomes with platinum-based regimens.,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,The study robustly proves the superiority of immunotherapy over chemotherapy.; The evidence for the efficacy of immunotherapy was limited.; The study found clear benefits of double-agent immunotherapy.,The evidence for the efficacy of immunotherapy was limited.,To find the best therapy for people with PS 2 in advanced NSCLC without a specific mutation; To develop a new platinum-based chemotherapy drug; To compare supportive care with chemotherapy,To find the best therapy for people with PS 2 in advanced NSCLC without a specific mutation
5e0a2f6377f8652c6fc3f887,finetuned_6,Is molnupiravir (an antiviral medicine) safe and effective in treating people with COVID-19?,"To assess the effects of molnupiravir in people with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and mild to moderate symptoms. We identified all relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) by searching the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, Science Citation Index Expanded, the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Literature on Coronavirus Disease database, and the COVID Network Meta-Analysis database with no language restrictions up to 26 April 2024. In outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19, molnupiravir 800 mg taken orally every 12 hours for five days probably results in little to no difference in all-cause mortality and may result in little to no difference in rates of hospitalisation and symptom resolution. There is evidence of increased viral clearance by day 5, but the clinical relevance of this finding is unclear. There is probably little to no difference in adverse events, and there is little to no difference in serious adverse events, with molnupiravir versus placebo or standard care. Inpatient data are lacking, and there is no evidence of benefit of molnupiravir in this population. Further research involving inpatients may change this.","Molnupiravir is a pill used to treat COVID-19 in people who are at high risk of developing severe illness. It works by interfering with the ability of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) to reproduce, helping the body to fight off the infection. We wanted to find out how molnupiravir compares to no treatment, placebo (dummy treatment), or standard of care in decreasing death and hospitalisation in people with COVID-19; speeding up recovery (time to symptom resolution); clearing the virus that causes COVID-19 (viral clearance); safety, by looking at all unwanted events and serious unwanted events. We searched for studies that evaluated molnupiravir compared with no treatment, placebo, or standard of care in people with confirmed COVID-19. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods. The types of studies we looked at were randomised controlled trials, which assign people randomly to two or more treatment groups. This is the best way to ensure that study groups are similar, and that investigators and participants don't know who is in which group. The review included 11 studies with 31,272 participants, mostly outpatients (people not admitted to hospital) with mild to moderate COVID-19. When we combined results from studies that recruited outpatients (people not admitted to hospital) with mild to moderate COVID-19, we found the following key results: Molnupiravir probably results in little to no difference in the risk of death. Compared with people receiving placebo or standard of care, between four and 10 fewer people receiving molnupiravir will die within one month for every 10,000 people treated. We considered this reduction clinically insignificant. Molnupiravir may not reduce hospitalisations, meaning it may not prevent people from getting sicker or needing hospital care. There was evidence of increased viral clearance with molnupiravir by day 5, but this effect diminished by day 14, and we are not sure if it makes any real difference for patients. Molnupiravir may have little to no effect on the probability of having no symptoms by day 14 or day 28. Molnupiravir probably results in little to no difference in adverse events, and results in little to no difference in serious adverse events. There are too few data to draw clear conclusions about molnupiravir's effects in people admitted to hospital with severe COVID-19. Most evidence comes from studies conducted in outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19, so the results may not apply to people with severe illness who are hospitalised. The studies provided scarce evidence on long-term outcomes such as quality of life after recovery or how long the virus stays in the body. We were unable to analyse whether molnupiravir had a different effect in certain groups of people, like those with severe pre-existing conditions or people from low- or middle-income countries.",1106,molnupiravir; SARS-CoV-2; mild to moderate COVID-19; all-cause mortality; symptom resolution; viral clearance; clinical relevance; adverse events,What reasoning could justify the conclusion that molnupiravir has little effect on hospitalisations in mild COVID-19 cases?,How might the design of future studies be improved to better assess molnupiravir's effectiveness in severe COVID-19 cases?,Select the items that are animals,What conclusions might be drawn from the evidence of increased viral clearance by day 5 with no significant impact on symptoms?,What challenges could arise in interpreting the clinical relevance of viral clearance associated with molnupiravir?,No significant difference in hospitalisation rates compared to placebo; Possible misinterpretation of viral clearance as recovery; Bias introduced by non-randomized study designs,No significant difference in hospitalisation rates compared to placebo,Including a larger sample of hospitalised patients; Excluding all outpatients to reduce variability; Focusing on participants from higher-income countries,Including a larger sample of hospitalised patients,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,Viral clearance may not correlate directly with clinical outcomes; The study possibly had errors in measuring viral load; Molnupiravir has a durable effect lasting beyond day 5,Viral clearance may not correlate directly with clinical outcomes,Lack of alignment between viral clearance and patient recovery; Overstated results from non-peer-reviewed studies; Underrepresentation of severe cases in the data,Lack of alignment between viral clearance and patient recovery
5ca88c7900dbf0000127c5d5,static_1,Glucagon-like peptide analogues for type 2 diabetes,"Glucagon-like peptide analogues are a new class of drugs used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes that mimic the endogenous hormone glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1). GLP-1 is an incretin, a gastrointestinal hormone that is released into the circulation in response to ingested nutrients. GLP-1 regulates glucose levels by stimulating glucose-dependent insulin secretion and biosynthesis, and by suppressing glucagon secretion, delayed gastric emptying and promoting satiety.
To assess the effects of glucagon-like peptide analogues in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Studies were obtained from electronic searches of The Cochrane Library (last search issue 1, 2011), MEDLINE (last search March 2011), EMBASE (last search March 2011), Web of Science (last search March 2011) and databases of ongoing trials.
Studies were included if they were randomised controlled trials of a minimum duration of eight weeks comparing a GLP-1 analogue with placebo, insulin, an oral anti-diabetic agent, or another GLP-1 analogue in people with type 2 diabetes.
Data extraction and quality assessment of studies were done by one reviewer and checked by a second. Data were analysed by type of GLP-1 agonist and comparison treatment. Where appropriate, data were summarised in a meta-analysis (mean differences and risk ratios summarised using a random-effects model).
Seventeen randomised controlled trials including relevant analyses for 6899 participants were included in the analysis. Studies were mostly of short duration, usually 26 weeks. In comparison with placebo, all GLP-1 agonists reduced glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels by about 1%. Exenatide 2 mg once weekly and liraglutide 1.8 mg reduced it by 0.20% and 0.24% respectively more than insulin glargine. Exenatide 2 mg once weekly reduced HbA1c more than exenatide 10 ?g twice daily, sitagliptin and pioglitazone. Liraglutide 1.8 mg reduced HbA1c by 0.33% more than exenatide 10 ?g twice daily. Liraglutide led to similar improvements in HbA1c compared to sulphonylureas but reduced it more than sitagliptin and rosiglitazone. Both exenatide and liraglutide led to greater weight loss than most active comparators, including in participants not experiencing nausea. Hypoglycaemia occurred more frequently in participants taking concomitant sulphonylurea. GLP-1 agonists caused gastrointestinal adverse effects, mainly nausea. These adverse events were strongest at the beginning and then subsided. Beta-cell function was improved with GLP-1 agonists but the effect did not persist after cessation of treatment. None of the studies was long enough to assess long-term positive or negative effects.
GLP-1 agonists are effective in improving glycaemic control.","Glucagon-like peptide analogues or agonists are a new kind of drug in the treatment of type 2 diabetes that are given by injection under the skin. They regulate glucose levels by stimulating glucose-dependent insulin secretion and biosynthesis, and by suppressing glucagon secretion, delaying gastric emptying and promoting satiety. Various glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists are in use or in the licensing process, including exenatide, liraglutide, albiglutide, taspoglutide, lixisenatide and LY2189265.
Seventeen randomised controlled trials of mostly moderate to high quality randomised approximately 6899 people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Studies were mostly of short duration, usually 26 weeks. The longest duration study was 30 weeks. Of the seventeen studies, one compared albiglutide with placebo, two compared exenatide 10µg twice daily against exenatide 2 mg once weekly, one compared exenatide 2 mg once weekly against insulin glargine, one compared exenatide 2 mg once weekly against pioglitazone and sitagliptin, five compared liraglutide with placebo, two compared liraglutide with sulphonylurea, one each compared exenatide twice daily with liraglutide, liraglutide with sitagliptin, liraglutide with rosiglitazone and liraglutide with insulin glargine, two compared taspoglutide with placebo and one each compared lixisenatide with placebo and LY2189265 with placebo. In people already treated with oral anti-diabetes drugs, addition of glucagon-like peptide analogues improved blood sugar control in comparison to placebo, rosiglitazone, pioglitazone or sitagliptin, but not always in comparison to insulin (for exenatide) or glimepiride (a sulphonylurea). Glucagon-like peptide analogous caused more weight loss than any of the comparison treatments. However, more nausea and other gastrointestinal effects such as diarrhoea or vomiting were seen, though these tended to wear off and were not seen in all participants. There was slightly more hypoglycaemia with glucagon-like analogous than with placebo, but generally less than with other anti-diabetic treatments. The incidence of hypoglycaemia occurred more frequently in participants taking concomitant sulphonylurea. The studies were not long enough to assess long-term side effects.

5ca88c7900dbf0000127c5d5,static_2,Case management approaches to home support for people with dementia,"Over 35 million people are estimated to be living with dementia in the world and the societal costs are very high. Case management is a widely used and strongly promoted complex intervention for organising and co-ordinating care at the level of the individual, with the aim of providing long-term care for people with dementia in the community as an alternative to early admission to a care home or hospital. To evaluate the effectiveness of case management approaches to home support for people with dementia, from the perspective of the different people involved (patients, carers, and staff) compared with other forms of treatment, including treatment as usual, standard community treatment and other non-case management interventions. We searched the following databases up to 31 December 2013: ALOIS, the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group, The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, Web of Science (including Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED) and Social Science Citation Index), Campbell Collaboration/SORO database and the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group. We updated this search in March 2014 but results have not yet been incorporated. We include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of case management interventions for people with dementia living in the community and their carers. We screened interventions to ensure that they focused on planning and co-ordination of care. We used standard methodological procedures as required by The Cochrane Collaboration. Two review authors independently extracted data and made 'Risk of bias' assessments using Cochrane criteria. For continuous outcomes, we used the mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) between groups along with its confidence interval (95% CI). We applied a fixed- or random-effects model as appropriate. For binary or dichotomous data, we generated the corresponding odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI. We assessed heterogeneity by the  I² statistic. We include 13 RCTs involving 9615 participants with dementia in the review. Case management interventions in studies varied. We found low to moderate overall risk of bias; 69% of studies were at high risk for performance bias. The case management group were significantly less likely to be institutionalised (admissions to residential or nursing homes) at six months (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.98, n = 5741, 6 RCTs,  I² = 0%, P = 0.02) and at 18 months (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.61, n = 363, 4 RCTs,  I² = 0%, P = 0.003). However, the effects at 10 - 12 months (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.08, n = 5990, 9 RCTs, IÃÆÃÆÃâÃÂ¯ÃÆÃâÃâÃÂ¿ÃÆÃâÃâÃÂ½ = 48%, P = 0.39) and 24 months (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.52 to 2.03, n = 201, 2 RCTs,  I² = 0%, P = 0.94) were uncertain. There was evidence from one trial of a reduction in the number of days per month in a residential home or hospital unit in the case management group at six months (MD -5.80, 95% CI -7.93 to -3.67, n = 88, 1 RCT, P < 0.0001) and at 12 months (MD -7.70, 95% CI -9.38 to -6.02, n = 88, 1 RCT, P < 0.0001). One trial reported the length of time until participants were institutionalised at 12 months and the effects were uncertain (hazard ratio (HR): 0.66, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.14, P = 0.14). There was no difference in the number of people admitted to hospital at six (4 RCTs, 439 participants), 12 (5 RCTs, 585 participants) and 18 months (5 RCTs, 613 participants). For mortality at 4 - 6, 12, 18 - 24 and 36 months, and for participants' or carers' quality of life at 4, 6, 12 and 18 months, there were no significant effects. There was some evidence of benefits in carer burden at six months (SMD -0.07, 95% CI -0.12 to -0.01, n = 4601, 4 RCTs,  I² = 26%, P = 0.03) but the effects at 12 or 18 months were uncertain. Additionally, some evidence indicated case management was more effective at reducing behaviour disturbance at 18 months (SMD -0.35, 95% CI -0.63 to -0.07, n = 206, 2 RCTs  I² = 0%, P = 0.01) but effects were uncertain at four (2 RCTs), six (4 RCTs) or 12 months (5 RCTs). The case management group showed a small significant improvement in carer depression at 18 months (SMD -0.08, 95% CI -0.16 to -0.01, n = 2888, 3 RCTs, I² = 0%, P = 0.03). Conversely, the case management group showed greater improvement in carer well-being in a single study at six months (MD -2.20 CI -4.14 to -0.26, n = 65, 1 RCT, P = 0.03) but the effects were uncertain at 12 or 18 months. There was some evidence that case management reduced the total cost of services at 12 months (SMD -0.07, 95% CI -0.12 to -0.02, n = 5276, 2 RCTs, P = 0.01) and incurred lower dollar expenditure for the total three years (MD -705.00, 95% CI -1170.31 to -239.69, n = 5170, 1 RCT, P = 0.003). Data on a number of outcomes consistently indicated that the intervention group received significantly more community services. There is some evidence that case management is beneficial at improving some outcomes at certain time points, both in the person with dementia and in their carer. However, there was considerable heterogeneity between the interventions, outcomes measured and time points across the 13 included RCTs. There was some evidence from good-quality studies to suggest that admissions to care homes and overall healthcare costs are reduced in the medium term; however, the results at longer points of follow-up were uncertain. There was not enough evidence to clearly assess whether case management could delay institutionalisation in care homes. There were uncertain results in patient depression, functional abilities and cognition. Further work should be undertaken to investigate what components of case management are associated with improvement in outcomes. Increased consistency in measures of outcome would support future meta-analysis.","Many people are affected by dementia and the numbers are expected to rise as populations age. Most types of dementia are characterised by loss of memory and impairment in other cognitive functions, accompanied by functional impairment and difficulties in performing activities of daily living. The increasing number of people with dementia means more demand for both informal and formal sources of care. The extent of support provided depends on factors such as living situation, patient's and carer's characteristics, service provision, and availability of social networks. There are also wider financial costs of care, for example carers missing work for appointments or crises, becoming part-time workers, or leaving work altogether. Developing interventions such as case management, which enhances the co-ordination between different agencies involved in community care, might offer the support necessary to cover some of the needs of people with dementia and their carers. How case management is organised and implemented varies widely, and access to this type of care is influenced by long-term care funding policies and cultural variations in different countries. Case management has been tested in people with dementia and in carers in a number of countries and healthcare systems, but it is not clear whether current evidence supports its effectiveness. We found 13 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including 9615 participants with dementia worldwide. Eleven RCTs also included carers. Studies were conducted in different countries, varied in size and healthcare systems and compared various types of case management interventions with usual care or augmented usual care. Some studies examined the benefit of case management in reducing admissions to residential or nursing homes (institutionalisation). We found benefits at six months and 18 months but not at 12 and 24 months. However, when only studies which were clearly focused upon delaying institutionalisation or prolonging the period of community care were included we found a reduction in institutionalisation at 12 months. Some studies examined the benefits of case management in terms of reduced hospital length of stay, and there was evidence to suggest that it might increase at six months. Some studies indicated that case management was more effective at reducing behaviour disturbance at 18 months, reducing carer burden and depression and improving carer well-being at six months and social support at 12 months. Case management increases the use of community services but there was some indication that overall healthcare costs may be reduced in the first year. Some studies reported that case management was no more effective than usual care in improving patient depression, functional abilities or cognition. There was not enough evidence to clearly assess whether case management could increase the length of time until people with dementia were admitted to care homes. There were some problems regarding the methods of the studies. Similarly, the different ways in which the case management interventions were provided and the differences in outcome measurements made it difficult to draw clear conclusions.",1124,dementia; case management; institutionalisation; residential or nursing homes; community services; care homes; healthcare costs; behaviour disturbance; cognitive improvement; functional abilities,What are the implications of case management interventions on healthcare costs according to the studies?,How does the variability in case management implementation affect the study's conclusions?,Select all of the following that are colors,In what manner could the study's methodology be adjusted to improve its focus on long-term outcomes?,What differences were observed in the effectiveness of case management at various follow-up points?,"They consistently reduce overall healthcare costs.; They show mixed results, with some indication of cost reduction at 12 months.; They increase healthcare costs due to the integration of multiple services.","They show mixed results, with some indication of cost reduction at 12 months.",It creates challenges in measuring consistent outcomes.; It simplifies the comparison between different healthcare systems.; It enhances the generalizability of the study's results.,It creates challenges in measuring consistent outcomes.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,By incorporating a larger number of RCTs focused on longer follow-up periods.; By restricting the study to short-term outcomes only.; By increasing the sample size without altering the follow-up duration.,By incorporating a larger number of RCTs focused on longer follow-up periods.,Significant differences in institutionalization reduction were observed only at 6 and 18 months.; All time points showed equal effectiveness in reducing institutionalization.; Every follow-up point showed a consistent level of reduced healthcare costs.,Significant differences in institutionalization reduction were observed only at 6 and 18 months.
5ca88c7900dbf0000127c5d5,static_2,What were the unintended consequences of school-based measures to manage the COVID-19 pandemic?,"Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, schools were a key setting for intervening with public health and social measures (PHSM) to reduce transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Consequently, there is a need to assess the varied unintended consequences associated with PHSM implemented in the school setting, for students, teachers, and school staff, as well as for families and the wider community. This is an update of a Cochrane scoping review first published in 2022. To comprehensively identify and summarise the published literature on the unintended consequences of public health and social measures implemented in the school setting to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2. This will serve to identify critical knowledge gaps to inform future primary research and systematic reviews. It may also serve as a resource for future pandemic management. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, PsycINFO, ERIC, and Web of Science on 5 and 6 January 2023. We also searched two COVID-19-specific databases (Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease). Finally, we reviewed the included studies of all relevant systematic reviews and guidelines identified through the searches. We included studies that empirically assessed the impact of PHSM implemented in the school setting to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2. We imposed no restrictions with regard to the types of populations and specific interventions. Outcomes of interest were consequences that were measured or experienced, but not anticipated consequences. This review focused on real-world evidence: empirical quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-method studies were eligible for inclusion, but modelling studies were ineligible. The review was guided by a logic model. In line with the latest Cochrane effectiveness review of school measures to contain COVID-19 and a conceptual framework of PHSM, this logic model distinguishes between measures to make contacts safer (related to individual protection and the physical environment), measures to reduce contacts (related to social interactions, movement, and services) and surveillance and response measures. Unintended consequences comprise the following categories: health and well-being, health system and social welfare services, human and fundamental rights, acceptability and adherence, equality and equity, social and institutional, economic and resource, and ecological. The review team screened all titles and abstracts, then potentially eligible full-text articles, in duplicate. Across the included studies, we summarised and presented types of measures, consequences, and study designs using the predefined categories of the logic model, while allowing for emerging categories. We included 60 studies (57 new to this update) from 25 countries. There were 31 quantitative studies, 17 qualitative studies, and 12 mixed-method studies. Most targeted either students (26 studies), teachers and school staff (11 studies), or students and school staff (12 studies). Others evaluated measures aimed at parents (2 studies), staff and parents (1 study), students and teachers (3 studies), or the whole school (5 studies). The measures were related to individual protection (26 studies), the physical environment (20 studies), social interactions (25 studies), services (1 study), movement (3 studies), surveillance (9 studies) and response (7 studies). Nine studies evaluated the combined effect of multiple measures. The main consequences assessed were from the categories health and well-being (29 studies), acceptability and adherence (31 studies), and social and institutional (23 studies). Fewer studies covered consequences from the categories equality and equity (2 studies), economic and resource (7 studies), and ecological (1 study). No studies examined consequences for the health system and social welfare services or for human and fundamental rights. This scoping review provides an overview of the evidence on the unintended consequences of PHSM implemented in the school setting to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2. The 60 included studies describe a broad body of evidence and cover a range of measures and unintended consequences, primarily consequences for health and well-being, acceptability and adherence, social and institutional aspects, and economic aspects. The main gaps identified relate to consequences of school measures for the health system and social welfare services, human and fundamental rights, equality and equity, and the environment. Further research is needed to fill these gaps, making use of diverse methodological approaches. Future studies should explore unintended consequences - whether beneficial or harmful -  in more depth and over longer time periods, in different population groups, and across different contexts. A more robust evidence base could inform and facilitate decisions about whether, how, and when to implement or terminate COVID-19 risk mitigation measures in school settings, and how to counter negative unintended consequences.","During the COVID-19 pandemic, different measures were implemented in schools to help stop the virus spreading. These measures included changes to school rules or actions with the following goals: To reduce the spread of the virus when people were together, To reduce the number of face-to-face contacts between people, To test whether people had COVID-19, To isolate those with COVID-19 to prevent it spreading. School measures like these can have both planned (intended) effects and unplanned (unintended) effects, which we need to monitor. For example, a rule to improve hand hygiene should lead to more handwashing (a planned effect) but could also lead to skin problems (an unplanned effect). These unplanned effects can be negative or positive, and can affect students, teachers, other school staff members, parents, and the wider community. We identified four types of school measures: Measures to make contacts safer, Measures to reduce the opportunity for contacts, Surveillance and response measures, Multi-component measures. We aimed to find and describe evidence on the unplanned effects of school measures implemented to help contain the spread of COVID-19. We searched for studies that looked at side effects of school measures. We grouped the side effects into the following categories: Physical and mental health and well-being, Health and social care services, Human rights, Acceptability of measures, Unfair differences in health outcomes, Civil life, social interactions, and education, Money and resources, The environment. We summarised the available information on school measures and their side effects. We included 60 studies from 25 countries. Regarding study design, 31 used numbers and statistics, 17 used text and descriptions, and 12 used both numbers and descriptions. Most studies looked at measures for staff (11 studies) or students (26 studies), or measures aimed at both staff and students or the whole school (20 studies). Only three studies looked at measures for parents or caregivers. The studies investigated the following measures in schools: Individual protection (26 studies); for example, wearing masks, Changes to the physical environment (20 studies); for example, improving ventilation, Rules about social interactions (25 studies); for example, mixing online and in-person teaching, Changes to services (1 study); for example, cancelling extracurricular activities, Rules about movement (3 studies); for example, staying in class at break time, Surveillance measures (9 studies); for example, testing students and teachers, Response measures (7 studies); for example, isolating people with COVID-19. Nine studies looked at the joint effects of more than one measure (for example, joint effects of wearing masks and improving ventilation). Most studies focused on the following unplanned effects: The influence of school measures on health and well-being (29 studies), Whether school measures were acceptable or easy to carry out (31 studies), How school measures affected social interactions, school organisation, and education (23 studies). Other unplanned effects included the following: Changes to unfair differences in health outcomes (2 studies), Effects on money and resources (7 studies), Effects on the environment (1 study). Most of the studies in the review looked at the influence of school measures on health and well-being; social interactions, school organisation, and education; and whether measures were acceptable and easy to carry out. The most common school measures were wearing masks, cleaning and disinfecting rooms and surfaces, mixing online and in-person learning, and ensuring physical distancing. Many studies also looked at combinations of several measures. This review identified the gaps, where more research is needed. We need more studies to look at a wider variety of unplanned effects. We also need more studies looking at the unplanned effects of other school measures, such as testing and response measures. Future studies should look at long-term effects, too. We need more information about how these measures work in different types of schools and in different countries. This would help people make decisions about when and how to use different school measures.",1105,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; public health and social measures; physical environment; surveillance and response measures; equality and equity; social welfare services; human and fundamental rights; acceptability and adherence; scoping review; risk mitigation measures,What factors should be considered to enhance the evidence base on unintended consequences of school measures in future studies?,How might combining different school measures affect the study outcomes regarding unintended consequences?,Select all of the following that are colors,What are the implications of the knowledge gaps identified in the study for pandemic management in schools?,What was the main goal of the measures implemented in schools during the COVID-19 pandemic?,Focusing solely on quantitative studies; Exploring unintended consequences across diverse contexts and populations; Limiting research to current measures without considering new interventions,Exploring unintended consequences across diverse contexts and populations,It could identify synergies and overlapping effects; It would ensure that every measure's consequence is isolated and clear; It might make it harder to attribute specific outcomes to individual measures,It could identify synergies and overlapping effects; It might make it harder to attribute specific outcomes to individual measures,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,They suggest a need for diverse methodological research approaches; They indicate that all necessary measures have been adequately assessed; They reveal that unintended consequences are well understood in all areas,They suggest a need for diverse methodological research approaches,To stop the spread of the virus in school settings; To improve academic performance; To increase physical activities,To stop the spread of the virus in school settings
5ca88c7900dbf0000127c5d5,interactive_3,Selenium for preventing cancer,"This review is the third update of the Cochrane review ""Selenium for preventing cancer"". Selenium is a naturally occurring element with both nutritional and toxicological properties. Higher selenium exposure and selenium supplements have been suggested to protect against several types of cancer.
To gather and present evidence needed to address two research questions: 1. What is the aetiological relationship between selenium exposure and cancer risk in humans? 2. Describe the efficacy of selenium supplementation for cancer prevention in humans.
We updated electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 2), MEDLINE (Ovid, 2013 to January 2017, week 4), and Embase (2013 to 2017, week 6), as well as searches of clinical trial registries.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and longitudinal observational studies that enrolled adult participants.
We performed random-effects (RE) meta-analyses when two or more RCTs were available for a specific outcome. We conducted RE meta-analyses when five or more observational studies were available for a specific outcome. We assessed risk of bias in RCTs and in observational studies using Cochrane's risk assessment tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, respectively. We considered in the primary analysis data pooled from RCTs with low risk of bias. We assessed the certainty of evidence by using the GRADE approach.
We included 83 studies in this updated review: two additional RCTs (10 in total) and a few additional trial reports for previously included studies. RCTs involved 27,232 participants allocated to either selenium supplements or placebo. For analyses of RCTs with low risk of bias, the summary risk ratio (RR) for any cancer incidence was 1.01 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.10; 3 studies, 19,475 participants; high-certainty evidence). The RR for estimated cancer mortality was 1.02 (95% CI 0.80 to 1.30; 1 study, 17,448 participants). For the most frequently investigated site-specific cancers, investigators provided little evidence of any effect of selenium supplementation. Two RCTs with 19,009 participants indicated that colorectal cancer was unaffected by selenium administration (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.43), as were non-melanoma skin cancer (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.30 to 4.42; 2 studies, 2027 participants), lung cancer (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.50; 2 studies, 19,009 participants), breast cancer (RR 2.04, 95% CI 0.44 to 9.55; 1 study, 802 participants), bladder cancer (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.52; 2 studies, 19,009 participants), and prostate cancer (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.14; 4 studies, 18,942 participants). Certainty of the evidence was high for all of these cancer sites, except for breast cancer, which was of moderate certainty owing to imprecision, and non-melanoma skin cancer, which we judged as moderate certainty owing to high heterogeneity. RCTs with low risk of bias suggested increased melanoma risk. Results for most outcomes were similar when we included all RCTs in the meta-analysis, regardless of risk of bias. Selenium supplementation did not reduce overall cancer incidence (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.14; 5 studies, 21,860 participants) nor mortality (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.32; 2 studies, 18,698 participants). Summary RRs for site-specific cancers showed limited changes compared with estimates from high-quality studies alone, except for liver cancer, for which results were reversed. In the largest trial, the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Trial, selenium supplementation increased risks of alopecia and dermatitis, and for participants with highest background selenium status, supplementation also increased risk of high-grade prostate cancer. RCTs showed a slightly increased risk of type 2 diabetes associated with supplementation. A hypothesis generated by the Nutritional Prevention of Cancer Trial - that individuals with low blood selenium levels could reduce their risk of cancer (particularly prostate cancer) by increasing selenium intake - has not been confirmed. As RCT participants have been overwhelmingly male (88%), we could not assess the potential influence of sex or gender. We included 15 additional observational cohort studies (70 in total; over 2,360,000 participants). We found that lower cancer incidence (summary odds ratio (OR) 0.72, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.93; 7 studies, 76,239 participants) and lower cancer mortality (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.97; 7 studies, 183,863 participants) were associated with the highest category of selenium exposure compared with the lowest. Cancer incidence was lower in men (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.14, 4 studies, 29,365 men) than in women (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.77, 2 studies, 18,244 women). Data show a decrease in risk of site-specific cancers for stomach, colorectal, lung, breast, bladder, and prostate cancers. However, these studies have major weaknesses due to study design, exposure misclassification, and potential unmeasured confounding due to lifestyle or nutritional factors covarying with selenium exposure beyond those taken into account in multi-variable analyses. In addition, no evidence of a dose-response relation between selenium status and cancer risk emerged. Certainty of evidence was very low for each outcome. Some studies suggested that genetic factors might modify the relation between selenium and cancer risk - an issue that merits further investigation.
Well-designed and well-conducted RCTs have shown no beneficial effect of selenium supplements in reducing cancer risk (high certainty of evidence). Some RCTs have raised concerns by reporting a higher incidence of high-grade prostate cancer and type 2 diabetes in participants with selenium supplementation. No clear evidence of an influence of baseline participant selenium status on outcomes has emerged in these studies. Observational longitudinal studies have shown an inverse association between selenium exposure and risk of some cancer types, but null and direct relations have also been reported, and no systematic pattern suggesting dose-response relations has emerged. These studies suffer from limitations inherent to the observational design, including exposure misclassification and unmeasured confounding. Overall, there is no evidence to suggest that increasing selenium intake through diet or supplementation prevents cancer in humans. However, more research is needed to assess whether selenium may modify the risk of cancer in individuals with a specific genetic background or nutritional status, and to investigate possible differential effects of various forms of selenium.","We reviewed the evidence investigating the relation between selenium intake and cancer prevention. This review updates the most recent Cochrane review on this topic (Vinceti 2014, which was an update of Dennert 2011.
Selenium is a naturally occurring element that individuals are exposed to mainly through food consumption, although exposure can also occur through air, drinking water, and dietary supplements. Small amounts of selenium are essential for certain biological functions in humans, but slightly higher amounts can pose a toxicity risk, making selenium an element with a narrow, but as yet not well-defined, safe range of exposure. Selenium occurs in many different chemical forms with different biological activity. From the late 1960s, a few observational studies reported that people with high levels of selenium in their diet or in their body tissues had lower risk of cancer, and some laboratory studies showed that selenium could inhibit the growth of cancer cells. This led to widespread interest in selenium supplements and claims that taking such supplements could prevent cancer. Since that time, many more observational studies have been conducted to compare cancer rates among individuals with high and low selenium exposure. More recently, several randomised controlled trials designed to assess whether selenium supplementation can prevent cancer have been carried out. These trials played a major role in enhancing our understanding of the relation between selenium and cancer risk as a result of their stronger study design as compared with observational studies. The most recent trials in particular have shown high methodological quality and statistical power. Several trials focused on whether selenium could prevent prostate cancer.
This review includes 10 trials in which adults were randomly assigned to receive selenium supplements or placebo, and 70 observational studies in which adults were followed over time to determine whether their baseline selenium status was associated with their risk of cancer. The evidence is current to January 2017.
All of the high-quality randomised trials reported no effect of selenium on reducing overall risk of cancer or risk of particular cancers, including the most investigated outcome - prostate cancer. Some trials unexpectedly suggested that selenium may increase risks of high-grade prostate cancer, type 2 diabetes, and dermatological abnormalities.
Observational studies have yielded inconsistent evidence of a possible effect of selenium exposure on cancer risk, with no evidence of a dose-response relation. When we pooled results of these studies, overall they suggested an inverse relation between cancer exposure and subsequent incidence of any cancer or some specific cancers, such as colon and prostate cancer. However, observational studies have major weaknesses. The selenium exposure status of participants could have been misclassified owing to limitations of the indicators of selenium exposure used, as well as to uncertainty regarding the particular selenium species contributing to overall exposure. In addition, unmeasured confounding from lifestyle or nutritional factors - a major and well-known source of bias in nutritional epidemiology studies of observational design - could have been present. Therefore, the internal validity of these studies is limited.

5ca88c7900dbf0000127c5d5,interactive_4,Exercise-based rehabilitation for coronary heart disease,"Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the most common cause of death globally. However, with falling CHD mortality rates, an increasing number of people living with CHD may need support to manage their symptoms and prognosis. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) aims to improve the health and outcomes of people with CHD. This is an update of a Cochrane Review previously published in 2016. To assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of exercise-based CR (exercise training alone or in combination with psychosocial or educational interventions) compared with 'no exercise' control, on mortality, morbidity and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in people with CHD. We updated searches from the previous Cochrane Review, by searching CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two other databases in September 2020. We also searched two clinical trials registers in June 2021. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of exercise-based interventions with at least six months follow-up, compared with 'no exercise' control. The study population comprised adult men and women who have had a myocardial infarction (MI), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), or have angina pectoris, or coronary artery disease. We screened all identified references, extracted data and assessed risk of bias according to Cochrane methods. We stratified meta-analysis by duration of follow-up: short-term (6 to 12 months); medium-term (> 12 to 36 months); and long-term (> 3 years), and used meta-regression to explore potential treatment effect modifiers. We used GRADE for primary outcomes at 6 to 12 months (the most common follow-up time point). This review included 85 trials which randomised 23,430 people with CHD. This latest update identified 22 new trials (7795 participants). The population included predominantly post-MI and post-revascularisation patients, with a mean age ranging from 47 to 77 years. In the last decade, the median percentage of women with CHD has increased from 11% to 17%, but females still account for a similarly small percentage of participants recruited overall (< 15%). Twenty-one of the included trials were performed in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Overall trial reporting was poor, although there was evidence of an improvement in quality over the last decade. The median longest follow-up time was 12 months (range 6 months to 19 years). At short-term follow-up (6 to 12 months), exercise-based CR likely results in a slight reduction in all-cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 1.04; 25 trials; moderate certainty evidence), a large reduction in MI (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.93; 22 trials; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 75, 95% CI 47 to 298; high certainty evidence), and a large reduction in all-cause hospitalisation (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.77; 14 trials; NNTB 12, 95% CI 9 to 21; moderate certainty evidence). Exercise-based CR likely results in little to no difference in risk of cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.14; 15 trials; moderate certainty evidence), CABG (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.27; 20 trials; high certainty evidence), and PCI (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.19; 13 trials; moderate certainty evidence) up to 12 months' follow-up. We are uncertain about the effects of exercise-based CR on cardiovascular hospitalisation, with a wide confidence interval including considerable benefit as well as harm (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.59; low certainty evidence). There was evidence of substantial heterogeneity across trials for cardiovascular hospitalisations ( I²= 53%), and of small study bias for all-cause hospitalisation, but not for all other outcomes. At medium-term follow-up, although there may be little to no difference in all-cause mortality (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.02; 15 trials), MI (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.27; 12 trials), PCI (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.35; 6 trials), CABG (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.23; 9 trials), and all-cause hospitalisation (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.03; 9 trials), a large reduction in cardiovascular mortality was found (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.93; 5 trials). Evidence is uncertain for difference in risk of cardiovascular hospitalisation (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.12; 3 trials). At long-term follow-up, although there may be little to no difference in all-cause mortality (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.10), exercise-based CR may result in a large reduction in cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.78; 8 trials) and MI (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.90; 10 trials). Evidence is uncertain for CABG (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.27; 4 trials), and PCI (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.20; 3 trials). Meta-regression showed benefits in outcomes were independent of CHD case mix, type of CR, exercise dose, follow-up length, publication year, CR setting, study location, sample size or risk of bias. There was evidence that exercise-based CR may slightly increase HRQoL across several subscales (SF-36 mental component, physical functioning, physical performance, general health, vitality, social functioning and mental health scores) up to 12 months' follow-up; however, these may not be clinically important differences. The eight trial-based economic evaluation studies showed exercise-based CR to be a potentially cost-effective use of resources in terms of gain in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). This updated Cochrane Review supports the conclusions of the previous version, that exercise-based CR provides important benefits to people with CHD, including reduced risk of MI, a likely small reduction in all-cause mortality, and a large reduction in all-cause hospitalisation, along with associated healthcare costs, and improved HRQoL up to 12 months' follow-up. Over longer-term follow-up, benefits may include reductions in cardiovascular mortality and MI. In the last decade, trials were more likely to include females, and be undertaken in LMICs, increasing the generalisability of findings. Well-designed, adequately-reported RCTs of CR in people with CHD more representative of usual clinical practice are still needed. Trials should explicitly report clinical outcomes, including mortality and hospital admissions, and include validated HRQoL outcome measures, especially over longer-term follow-up, and assess costs and cost-effectiveness.","Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the single most common cause of death globally. However, with falling CHD mortality rates, an increasing number of people live with CHD and may need support to manage their symptoms (such as angina, shortness of breath with physical activity, and fatigue) and reduce the chances of future problems, such as heart attacks. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (exercise training alone or in combination with psychological or educational interventions) aims to improve the health and outcomes of people with CHD. We searched the scientific literature for randomised controlled trials (experiments that randomly allocate participants to one of two or more treatment groups) looking at the effectiveness of exercise-based treatments compared with no exercise in people of all ages with CHD. The evidence is current to September 2020. This latest update identified an additional 22 trials (7795 participants). We included a total of 85 trials that studied 23,430 people with CHD, predominantly heart attack survivors and those who had undergone heart bypass surgery or angioplasty (a procedure which widens narrowed or obstructed arteries or veins). Thirty-eight (45%) of the trials involved exercise-only interventions and 47 (55%) involved interventions with exercise plus other components. The type of exercise most often included was stationary cycling, walking or circuit training. Twenty-one (25%) of the interventions were delivered in the participants' homes. The findings of this update are consistent with the previous (2016) version of this Cochrane Review, and show important benefits of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation that include a reduction in the risk of death due to any cause, heart attack, and hospital admission, and improvements in health-related quality of life, compared with not undertaking exercise. A small body of economic evidence was identified, indicating exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation to be cost-effective. Many of the studies identified in this current update were undertaken in low- and middle-income countries, which increases the generalisability of our results to these settings where levels of CHD are high and continue to increase. Although the reporting of methods has improved in recent trials, lack of reporting key methodological aspects made it difficult to assess the overall methodological quality and risk of possible bias of the evidence.",1031,Coronary heart disease; cardiac rehabilitation; myocardial infarction; coronary artery bypass graft; percutaneous coronary intervention; angina pectoris; health-related quality of life; quality-adjusted life years; psychosocial interventions; revascularisation,How do the latest findings on exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation enhance the understanding of its benefits for people with CHD?,What is the primary aim of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) in people with CHD?,Select the items that are animals,How does exercise-based CR affect the risk of hospital admission for those with CHD?,What type of exercise is most commonly included in exercise-based CR?,They demonstrate a reduction in cardiovascular mortality over long-term follow-up.; They highlight the lack of effectiveness in reducing hospital admissions.; They confirm improvements in health-related quality of life within 12 months.,They demonstrate a reduction in cardiovascular mortality over long-term follow-up.; They confirm improvements in health-related quality of life within 12 months.,To improve health and outcomes; To increase hospital admissions; To eliminate the need for medication,To improve health and outcomes,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,Reduces hospital admission risk; Increases hospital admission risk; Has no impact on hospital admission risk,Reduces hospital admission risk,Swimming; Stationary cycling; Weightlifting,Stationary cycling
5ca88c7900dbf0000127c5d5,interactive_4,Rivastigmine for people with Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer's disease is the commonest cause of dementia affecting older people. One of the therapeutic strategies aimed at ameliorating the clinical manifestations of Alzheimer's disease is to enhance cholinergic neurotransmission in the brain by the use of cholinesterase inhibitors to delay the breakdown of acetylcholine released into synaptic clefts. Tacrine, the first of the cholinesterase inhibitors to undergo extensive trials for this purpose, was associated with significant adverse effects including hepatotoxicity. Other cholinesterase inhibitors, including rivastigmine, with superior properties in terms of specificity of action and lower risk of adverse effects have since been introduced. Rivastigmine has received approval for use in 60 countries including all member states of the European Union and the USA. To determine the clinical efficacy and safety of rivastigmine for patients with dementia of Alzheimer's type. We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialized Register, on 2 March 2015 using the terms: Rivastigmine OR exelon OR ENA OR ""SDZ ENA 713"". ALOIS contains records of clinical trials identified from monthly searches of a number of major healthcare databases (Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS), numerous trial registries and grey literature sources. We included all unconfounded, double-blind, randomised, controlled trials in which treatment with rivastigmine was administered to patients with dementia of the Alzheimer's type for 12 weeks or more and its effects compared with those of placebo in a parallel group of patients, or where two formulations of rivastigmine were compared. One review author (JSB) applied the study selection criteria, assessed the quality of studies and extracted data. A total of 13 trials met the inclusion criteria of the review. The trials had a duration of between 12 and 52 weeks. The older trials tested a capsule form with a dose of up to 12 mg/day. Trials reported since 2007 have tested continuous dose transdermal patch formulations delivering 4.6, 9.5 and 17.7 mg/day. Our main analysis compared the safety and efficacy of rivastigmine 6 to 12 mg/day orally or 9.5 mg/day transdermally with placebo. Seven trials contributed data from 3450 patients to this analysis. Data from another two studies were not included because of a lack of information and methodological concerns. All the included trials were multicentre trials and recruited patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease with a mean age of about 75 years. All had low risk of bias for randomisation and allocation but the risk of bias due to attrition was unclear in four studies, low in one study and high in two studies. After 26 weeks of treatment rivastigmine compared to placebo was associated with better outcomes for cognitive function measured with the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-Cog) score (mean difference (MD) -1.79; 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.21 to -1.37, n = 3232, 6 studies) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score (MD 0.74; 95% CI 0.52 to 0.97, n = 3205, 6 studies), activities of daily living (SMD 0.20; 95% CI 0.13 to 0.27, n = 3230, 6 studies) and clinician rated global impression of changes, with a smaller proportion of patients treated with rivastigmine experiencing no change or a deterioration (OR 0.68; 95% CI 0.58 to 0.80, n = 3338, 7 studies). Three studies reported behavioural change, and there were no differences compared to placebo (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.04; 95% CI -0.14 to 0.06, n = 1529, 3 studies). Only one study measured the impact on caregivers using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Caregiver Distress (NPI-D) scale and this found no difference between the groups (MD 0.10; 95% CI -0.91 to 1.11, n = 529, 1 study). Overall, participants who received rivastigmine were about twice as likely to withdraw from the trials (odds ratio (OR) 2.01, 95% CI 1.71 to 2.37, n = 3569, 7 studies) or to experience an adverse event during the trials (OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.82 to 2.57, n = 3587, 7 studies). Rivastigmine (6 to 12 mg daily orally or 9.5 mg daily transdermally) appears to be beneficial for people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. In comparisons with placebo, better outcomes were observed for rate of decline of cognitive function and activities of daily living, although the effects were small and of uncertain clinical importance. There was also a benefit from rivastigmine on the outcome of clinician's global assessment. There were no differences between the rivastigmine group and placebo group in behavioural change or impact on carers. At these doses the transdermal patch may have fewer side effects than the capsules but has comparable efficacy. The quality of evidence is only moderate for all of the outcomes reviewed because of a risk of bias due to dropouts. ","Alzheimer's disease is the commonest cause of dementia affecting older people. As the disease progresses, people lose the ability to remember, communicate, think clearly and perform the usual daily activities. Their behaviour or personality may also change. In severe Alzheimer's disease, the patients lose the ability to care for themselves and require full time care. Currently, there is no cure available for Alzheimer's disease, but a few pharmacological interventions are available to alleviate symptoms. The symptoms are caused by the loss of a type of nerve cell in the brain called cholinergic neurons. Rivastigmine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, works by increasing the levels of a brain chemical called acetylcholine which allows the nerve cells to communicate. This may improve the symptoms of dementia. Rivastigmine can be taken orally, either as capsules or a liquid, or by applying a patch on the skin. Its effectiveness in improving the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and safety were evaluated in this review.This review included double-blinded randomised controlled trials, and the evidence was searched for up to March 2015 using the standard Cochrane methods. The review included studies conducted for at least 12 weeks that compared the safety and effectiveness of rivastigmine compared with placebo. Thirteen studies that met these criteria were found. Most of these studies involved people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease with an average age of around 75 years. The quality of the evidence for most of the outcomes reviewed was moderate. The main factors affecting our confidence in the results included relatively high number of patients dropping out in some of the trials (the rates of dropout in the rivastigmine arms were higher). There were also concerns about the applicability of the evidence for the long term treatment of Alzheimer's disease since data from double-blinded randomised controlled trials were only available for up to 12 months. All the data included in the main analysis of this review came from studies either sponsored or funded by the drug manufacturer (Novartis Pharma).",1128,Alzheimer's disease; cholinergic neurotransmission; cholinesterase inhibitors; acetylcholine; hepatotoxicity; rivastigmine; transdermal patch; activities of daily living; attrition,"In terms of study design, how could future investigations improve upon the current evidence regarding rivastigmine?",What conclusions can be drawn about the benefits of rivastigmine in terms of patient behavior?,Select all of the following that are colors,What is the main purpose of using rivastigmine in Alzheimer's disease?,Summarize the main findings regarding the efficacy of rivastigmine.,Include more diverse patient populations for broader applicability.; Focus solely on short-term effects to enhance result precision.; Implement measures to reduce dropout rates.,Include more diverse patient populations for broader applicability.; Implement measures to reduce dropout rates.,Rivastigmine leads to significant improvements in behavior compared to placebo.; There are no observable differences between rivastigmine and placebo in behavioral changes.; Behavioral improvements are the primary benefit of rivastigmine.,There are no observable differences between rivastigmine and placebo in behavioral changes.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,To cure Alzheimer's disease; To alleviate symptoms of dementia; To increase the production of neurons,To alleviate symptoms of dementia,Rivastigmine significantly improved cognitive functions.; Rivastigmine halted the progression of Alzheimer's.; Rivastigmine showed no differences compared to placebo.,Rivastigmine significantly improved cognitive functions.
5ca88c7900dbf0000127c5d5,finetuned_5,Does personalised advice via computer or mobile devices reduce heavy drinking?,"Excessive alcohol use contributes significantly to physical and psychological illness, injury and death, and a wide array of social harm in all age groups. A proven strategy for reducing excessive alcohol consumption levels is to offer a brief conversation-based intervention in primary care settings, but more recent technological innovations have enabled people to interact directly via computer, mobile device or smartphone with digital interventions designed to address problem alcohol consumption. To assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of digital interventions for reducing hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption, alcohol-related problems, or both, in people living in the community, specifically: (i) Are digital interventions more effective and cost-effective than no intervention (or minimal input) controls? (ii) Are digital interventions at least equally effective as face-to-face brief alcohol interventions? (iii) What are the effective component behaviour change techniques (BCTs) of such interventions and their mechanisms of action? (iv) What theories or models have been used in the development and/or evaluation of the intervention? Secondary objectives were (i) to assess whether outcomes differ between trials where the digital intervention targets participants attending health, social care, education or other community-based settings and those where it is offered remotely via the internet or mobile phone platforms; (ii) to specify interventions according to their mode of delivery (e.g. functionality features) and assess the impact of mode of delivery on outcomes. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ERIC, HTA and Web of Knowledge databases; ClinicalTrials.com and WHO ICTRP trials registers and relevant websites to April 2017. We also checked the reference lists of included trials and relevant systematic reviews. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effectiveness of digital interventions compared with no intervention or with face-to-face interventions for reducing hazardous or harmful alcohol consumption in people living in the community and reported a measure of alcohol consumption. We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. We included 57 studies which randomised a total of 34,390 participants. The main sources of bias were from attrition and participant blinding (36% and 21% of studies respectively, high risk of bias). Forty one studies (42 comparisons, 19,241 participants) provided data for the primary meta-analysis, which demonstrated that participants using a digital intervention drank approximately 23 g alcohol weekly (95% CI 15 to 30) (about 3 UK units) less than participants who received no or minimal interventions at end of follow up (moderate-quality evidence). Fifteen studies (16 comparisons, 10,862 participants) demonstrated that participants who engaged with digital interventions had less than one drinking day per month fewer than no intervention controls (moderate-quality evidence), 15 studies (3587 participants) showed about one binge drinking session less per month in the intervention group compared to no intervention controls (moderate-quality evidence), and in 15 studies (9791 participants) intervention participants drank one unit per occasion less than no intervention control participants (moderate-quality evidence). Only five small studies (390 participants) compared digital and face-to-face interventions. There was no difference in alcohol consumption at end of follow up (MD 0.52 g/week, 95% CI -24.59 to 25.63; low-quality evidence). Thus, digital alcohol interventions produced broadly similar outcomes in these studies. No studies reported whether any adverse effects resulted from the interventions. A median of nine BCTs were used in experimental arms (range = 1 to 22). 'B' is an estimate of effect (MD in quantity of drinking, expressed in g/week) per unit increase in the BCT, and is a way to report whether individual BCTs are linked to the effect of the intervention. The BCTs of goal setting (B -43.94, 95% CI -78.59 to -9.30), problem solving (B -48.03, 95% CI -77.79 to -18.27), information about antecedents (B -74.20, 95% CI -117.72 to -30.68), behaviour substitution (B -123.71, 95% CI -184.63 to -62.80) and credible source (B -39.89, 95% CI -72.66 to -7.11) were significantly associated with reduced alcohol consumption in unadjusted models. In a multivariable model that included BCTs with B > 23 in the unadjusted model, the BCTs of behaviour substitution (B -95.12, 95% CI -162.90 to -27.34), problem solving (B -45.92, 95% CI -90.97 to -0.87), and credible source (B -32.09, 95% CI -60.64 to -3.55) were associated with reduced alcohol consumption. The most frequently mentioned theories or models in the included studies were Motivational Interviewing Theory (7/20), Transtheoretical Model (6/20) and Social Norms Theory (6/20). Over half of the interventions (n = 21, 51%) made no mention of theory. Only two studies used theory to select participants or tailor the intervention. There was no evidence of an association between reporting theory use and intervention effectiveness. There is moderate-quality evidence that digital interventions may lower alcohol consumption, with an average reduction of up to three (UK) standard drinks per week compared to control participants. Substantial heterogeneity and risk of performance and publication bias may mean the reduction was lower. Low-quality evidence from fewer studies suggested there may be little or no difference in impact on alcohol consumption between digital and face-to-face interventions. The BCTs of behaviour substitution, problem solving and credible source were associated with the effectiveness of digital interventions to reduce alcohol consumption and warrant further investigation in an experimental context. Reporting of theory use was very limited and often unclear when present. Over half of the interventions made no reference to any theories. Limited reporting of theory use was unrelated to heterogeneity in intervention effectiveness.","We aimed to find out if personalised advice to reduce heavy drinking provided using a computer or mobile device is better than nothing or printed information. We also compared advice provided using a computer or mobile device to advice given in a face-to-face conversation. The main outcome was how much alcohol people drank.
Heavy drinking causes over 60 diseases, as well as many accidents, injuries and early deaths each year. Brief advice or counselling, delivered by doctors or nurses, can help people reduce their drinking by around 4 to 5 units a week. In the UK, this is around two pints (1.13 L) of beer or half a bottle of wine (375 mL) each week. However, people may be embarrassed by talking about alcohol. The studies included people in workplaces, colleges or health clinics and internet users. Everyone typed information about their drinking into a computer or mobile device - which then gave half the people advice about how much they drank and the effect this has on health. This group also received suggestions about how to cut down on drinking. The other group could sometimes read general health information. Between one month and one year later, everyone was asked to confirm how much they were drinking. Drinking levels in both groups were compared to each other at these time points. Many (56%) studies were funded by government or research foundation funds. Some (11%) were funded by personal awards such as PhD fellowships. The rest did not report sources of funding. We included 57 studies comparing the drinking of people getting advice about alcohol from computers or mobile devices with those who did not after one to 12 months. Of these, 41 studies (42 comparisons, 19,241 participants) focused on the actual amounts that people reported drinking each week. Most people reported drinking less if they received advice about alcohol from a computer or mobile device compared to people who did not get this advice. Evidence shows that the amount of alcohol people cut down may be about 1.5 pints (800 mL) of beer or a third of a bottle of wine (250 mL) each week. Other measures supported the effectiveness of digital alcohol interventions, although the size of the effect tended to be smaller than for overall alcohol consumption. Positive differences in measures of drinking were seen at 1, 6 and 12 months after the advice. There was not enough information to help us decide if advice was better from computers, telephones or the internet to reduce risky drinking. We do not know which pieces of advice were the most important to help people reduce problem drinking. However, advice from trusted people such as doctors seemed helpful, as did recommendations that people think about specific ways they could overcome problems that might prevent them from drinking less and suggestions about things to do instead of drinking. We included five studies which compared the drinking of people who got advice from computers or mobile devices with advice from face-to-face conversations with doctors or nurses; there may be little or no difference between these to reduce heavy drinking. No studies reported whether any harm came from the interventions. Personalised advice using computers or mobile devices may help people reduce heavy drinking better than doing nothing or providing only general health information. Personalised advice through computers or mobile devices may make little or no difference to reduce drinking compared to face-to-face conversation.",1061,brief conversation-based intervention; hazardous alcohol consumption; community-based settings; behavior change techniques; Behavior substitution,What specific behavior change techniques (BCTs) were most strongly associated with the effectiveness of digital interventions?,Which measure was used as a key outcome for assessing digital interventions?,Select the items that are animals,How is the advice delivered through digital interventions typically personalized?,In what way did the results vary when digital interventions were compared with face-to-face advice?,Goal setting and credible source; Behavior substitution and problem-solving; Information about antecedents and behavior substitution,Behavior substitution and problem-solving,How much alcohol people drank; The participants' weight loss; The number of exercise sessions per week,How much alcohol people drank,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,By considering individual drinking habits and health effects; By providing generalized health tips; By sending automated text messages at fixed times,By considering individual drinking habits and health effects,There was little or no difference in effectiveness; Digital was significantly more effective; Face-to-face was significantly more effective,There was little or no difference in effectiveness
5ca88c7900dbf0000127c5d5,finetuned_6,Lipid-lowering agents for nephrotic syndrome,"Nephrotic syndrome is the collective name given to a group of symptoms that include proteinuria, lipiduria, hypoalbuminaemia, oedema, hypercholesterolaemia, elevated triglycerides, and hyperlipidaemia. Hyperlipidaemia is thought to aggravate glomerulosclerosis (hardening of blood vessels in the kidneys) and enhance progression of glomerular disease. Studies have established that reduction in total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is associated with reduction in risk of cardiovascular diseases. In 2011, the European Society of Cardiology and European Atherosclerosis Society guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemia recommended use of statins as first-line agents in the management of nephrotic dyslipidaemia. However, the effectiveness and safety of statins for people with nephrotic syndrome remains uncertain. Furthermore, the efficacy of second-line lipid-lowering drugs, such as ezetimibe and nicotinic acid, has not been proven in patients with nephrotic syndrome who are unable to tolerate statin therapy. This review aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of lipid-lowering agents in adults and children with nephrotic syndrome. We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register (to 18 March 2013) through contact with the Trials Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review. All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs (RCTs in which allocation to treatment was obtained by alternation, use of alternate medical records, date of birth or other predictable methods) looking at participants with nephrotic syndrome that compared any lipid-lowering agent to placebo, no treatment or other lipid-lowering agents, given for not less than four weeks, were included. Two authors independently assessed study eligibility and risk of bias, and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using a random effects model. Dichotomous results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). For continuous measures mean difference (MD) was used, or the standardised mean difference (SMD) where different scales had been used. We included five RCTs enrolling a total of 203 participants. Of these, four studies compared statins with no treatment or placebo, and one compared fibrates with placebo. We found no published studies comparing second-line agents such as ezetimibe, bile acid sequestrants, and nicotinic acid with placebo or no treatment. Our assessment of the risk of bias found that one study was judged overall to be at low risk of bias and the remaining four were judged to be at high risk of bias. Most outcomes were supported by single study data. One study reported significantly increased high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol among participants in the statin arm compared with the no treatment group (MD 5.40 mg/dL, 95% CI 2.31 to 8.49). Another study reported higher serum albumin in the statin group compared to those who received no treatment (MD 0.60 g/dL, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.06). No serious adverse events, such as rhabdomyolysis, were reported, however some minor events occurred. One study reported no significant difference in the number of participants with elevated liver enzymes (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.13 to 69.52); three studies reported liver enzymes remained within the normal range (no data provided). Four studies reported creatinine phosphokinase (CPK). One study indicated that CPK values fluctuated in both the simvastatin and placebo groups (no data provided); the remaining three studies reported CPK either stayed within the normal range (one study) or there was no significant difference between the lipid lowering agents and placebo. None of the included studies reported patient-centred outcomes including all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, or non-fatal myocardial infarction; only single studies reported cholesterol (HDL, LDL and total cholesterol), triglycerides, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, liver enzymes, and protein (serum, urine). High quality RCTs need to be conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of lipid-lowering drugs for people with nephrotic syndrome.","Nephrotic syndrome is a relatively rare condition in which the kidneys leak protein into the urine, leading to early signs such as swelling of the feet and face, along with low levels of protein in the blood and high levels of fats, particularly cholesterol and triglycerides. Management often includes therapies to reduce blood lipids, and several types of lipid-lowering drugs such as statins, bile acid sequestrants, nicotinic acid, and ezetimibe can be used. We searched for evidence from randomized controlled trials to determine whether lipid-lowering medications are beneficial for people with nephrotic syndrome. We found five small studies involving 203 participants that examined four different lipid-lowering agents: simvastatin, lovastatin, fluvastatin, and gemfibrozil. Based on the available evidence, there is currently not enough high-quality research to determine whether lipid-lowering drugs are effective for managing dyslipidaemia in people with nephrotic syndrome.",1084,nephrotic syndrome; oedema; hypercholesterolaemia; hyperlipidaemia; glomerulosclerosis; dyslipidaemia; statins; nicotinic acid; rhabdomyolysis; creatinine phosphokinase (CPK),What condition involves kidneys leaking protein into urine?,Identify a type of medication used to manage blood lipids in nephrotic syndrome.,Select all of the following that are colors,Summarize the main reason for using lipid-lowering drugs in nephrotic syndrome treatment.,Describe the evidence available for the effectiveness of lipid-lowering drugs in nephrotic syndrome.,Nephrotic syndrome; Hypertension; Diabetes,Nephrotic syndrome,Statins; Antibiotics; Painkillers,Statins,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,To reduce blood fat levels; To increase urination; To boost immune response,To reduce blood fat levels,Insufficient high-quality research; Clear and well-documented effectiveness; No research conducted,Insufficient high-quality research

Antiarrhythmic drugs have been used shortly after ablation in an attempt to maintain sinus rhythm, particularly Class I and III agents. However, it still needs to be established if the use of Class I or III antiarrhythmic medications, or both, reduce the risk of recurrence of ATa.
To assess the effects of oral Class I and III antiarrhythmic drugs versus control (standard medical therapy without Class I or III antiarrhythmics, or placebo) for maintaining sinus rhythm in people undergoing catheter ablation for AF.
We systematically searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science Core Collection, and two clinical trial registers without restrictions on language or date to 5 August 2022.
We sought published, unpublished, and ongoing parallel-design, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving adult participants undergoing ablation for AF, with subsequent comparison of Class I and/or III antiarrhythmic use versus control (standard medical therapy or non-Class I and/or III antiarrhythmic use).
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane and performed meta-analyses with risk ratios (RR) and Peto odds ratios (Peto OR). Our primary outcomes were recurrence of atrial tachyarrhythmias; adverse events: thromboembolic events; adverse events: myocardial infarction; adverse events: new diagnosis of heart failure; and adverse events: requirement for one or more hospitalisations for atrial tachyarrhythmia. Our secondary outcomes were: all-cause mortality; and requirement for one or more repeat ablations. Where possible, we performed comparison analysis by Class I and/or III antiarrhythmic and divided follow-up periods for our primary outcome. We performed comprehensive assessments of risk of bias and certainty of evidence applying the GRADE methodology.
We included nine RCTs involving a total of 3269 participants. Participants were on average 59.3 years old; 71.0% were male; and 72.9% and 27.4% had paroxysmal and persistent AF, respectively. Class I and/or III antiarrhythmics may reduce recurrence of ATa at 0 to 3 months postablation (risk ratio (RR) 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 0.94, 8 trials, 3046 participants, low-certainty evidence) and likely reduce recurrence at > 3 to 6 months, our a priori primary time point (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.93, 5 trials, 2591 participants, moderate-certainty evidence). Beyond six months the evidence is very uncertain, and the benefit of antiarrhythmics may not persist (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.55, 4 trials, 2244 participants, very low-certainty evidence). The evidence suggests that Class I and/or III antiarrhythmics may not increase the risk of thromboembolic events, myocardial infarction, all-cause mortality, or requirement for repeat ablation, at 0 to 3, > 3 to 6, and > 6 months (where data were available; low- to very low-certainty evidence). The use of Class I and/or III antiarrhythmics postablation likely reduces hospitalisations for ATa by approximately 57% at 0 to 3 months (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.64, moderate-certainty evidence). No data were available beyond three months. No data were available on new diagnoses of heart failure. Fewer data were available for Class I and III antiarrhythmics individually. Based on only one and two trials (n = 125 to 309), Class I antiarrhythmics may have little effect on recurrence of ATa at 0 to 3, > 3 to 6, and > 6 months (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.20, 2 trials, 309 participants; RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.19, 1 trial, 125 participants; RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.32, 1 trial, 125 participants; low-certainty evidence throughout); requirement for hospitalisation for ATa at 0 to 3 months (low-certainty evidence); or requirement for repeat ablation at 0 to 3 months (low-certainty evidence). No data were available for thromboembolic events, myocardial infarction, new diagnosis of heart failure, or all-cause mortality at any time points, or hospitalisation or repeat ablation beyond three months. Class III antiarrhythmics may have little effect on recurrence of ATa at up to 3 months and at > 3 to 6 months (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.16, 4 trials, 599 participants, low-certainty evidence; RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.09, 2 trials, 318 participants, low-certainty evidence), and beyond 6 months one trial reported a possible increase in recurrence of ATa (RR 1.95, 95% CI 1.29 to 2.94, 1 trial, 112 participants, low-certainty evidence). Class III antiarrhythmics likely reduce hospitalisations for ATa at 0 to 3 months (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.63, moderate-certainty evidence), and may have little effect on all-cause mortality (low- to very low-certainty evidence). The effect of Class III antiarrhythmics on thromboembolic events and requirement for repeat ablation was uncertain (very low-certainty evidence for both outcomes). No data were available for myocardial infarction or new diagnosis of heart failure at any time point, outcomes other than recurrence beyond 6 months, or for hospitalisation and repeat ablation > 3 to 6 months. We assessed the majority of included trials as at low or unclear risk of bias. One trial reported an error in the randomisation process, raising the potential risk of selection bias; most of the included trials were non-blinded; and two trials were at high risk of attrition bias.
We found evidence to suggest that the use of Class I and/or III antiarrhythmics up to 3 months after ablation is associated with a reduced recurrence of ATa 0 to 6 months after ablation, which may not persist beyond 6 months, and an immediate reduction in hospitalisation for ATa 0 to 3 months after ablation. The evidence suggests there is no difference in rates of all-cause mortality, thromboembolic events, or myocardial infarction between Class I and/or III antiarrhythmics versus control.","We wanted to find out how effective certain classes of antiarrhythmic drugs (medications used to prevent or treat an irregular heart rhythm) are for maintaining sinus rhythm (normal heart rhythm) in people after catheter ablation (a technique using catheters to create controlled burns in the heart to prevent and treat arrhythmia occurrence) for atrial fibrillation (a common type of irregular heart rhythm), compared to catheter ablation alone.
The most common abnormal heart rhythm, atrial fibrillation can cause the upper two chambers of the heart (atria) to beat very rapidly leading to symptoms such as palpitations, dizziness, and shortness of breath. Treatment of atrial fibrillation typically includes medications to control the heart rate and reduce the risk of stroke. However, in some people, restoring the normal heart rhythm to control symptoms is achieved by creating controlled burns with ablation catheters to eliminate atrial fibrillation. Patients often revert back to atrial fibrillation despite ablation, and certain antiarrhythmic drugs (of which we were only interested in Class I and III) are given to reduce the risk of recurrence of arrhythmia.
We performed a thorough search of databases for all trials including atrial fibrillation and all individual Class I and Class III antiarrhythmic drugs including, for example, flecainide, propafenone, amiodarone, dronedarone, and sotalol.
We conducted the search on 5 August 2022, and identified 4682 citations (papers), out of which nine were eligible randomised controlled trials (a type of study where people are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups). The studies included a total of 3269 participants from six countries, who were assigned to either Class I or III antiarrhythmics (or both) or placebo (sugar pill)/standard treatment. People taking part in the studies were on average 59 years old, and 71% were male. Most people had paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (meaning they were not in atrial fibrillation all the time and alternated with normal rhythms).
We found that the effect of Class I and/or III antiarrhythmic drugs given up to around 3 months after ablation may reduce recurrence of arrhythmia at 0 to 3 months, and likely reduces recurrence at greater than 3 to 6 months, although the benefit does not appear to continue beyond 6 months (the evidence for this last result was very uncertain). We also looked at adverse outcomes (i.e. complications). We found that the use of antiarrhythmics was probably associated with a reduction in hospitalisation at 0 to 3 months. We also found evidence suggesting that antiarrhythmics are not associated with different rates of thromboembolic events (clots in the brain, lungs, or legs), heart attacks, death due to any cause, or requirement for repeat ablation compared with control or standard treatment.
Our confidence in the evidence was low for recurrence of arrhythmias at 0 to 3 months, moderate at 3 to 6 months, and very low at greater than 6 months.

616b5241d8eb9504f10a5cb2,static_1,Use of medication to treat depression in people with opioid dependence,"Lifetime prevalence of depression in subjects with opioid dependence is higher than in the general population (44-54% versus 16%) and represents a risk factor for morbidity and mortality. For patients on opioid agonist treatment, current prevalence rates of depression ranges between 10 and 30%, influencing negatively the outcome of the treatment. To evaluate the efficacy and the acceptability of antidepressants for the treatment of depressed opioid dependents treated with opioid agonists. We searched Pubmed, EMBASE, CINAHL (to October 2009), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library Cochrane Drug and Alcohol Group Specialised Register, issue 4, 2009), main electronic sources of ongoing trials, specific trial databases and reference lists of all relevant papers. Randomised and controlled clinical trials examining the efficacy of any antidepressant medication to treat depressed opioid dependents in treatment with opioid agonists. Two authors independently screened and extracted data from studies. Seven studies, 482 participants, met the inclusion criteria.  Comparing antidepressant with placebo, no statistically significant results for dropouts. Selecting studies with low risk of bias, 325 participants, results favour placebo, RR 1.40 (Cl 95% 1.00 to 1.96). For severity of depression, results from two studies, 183 participants, favour antidepressants utilising Clinical Global Impression Scale RR 1.92 (CI 95% 1.26 to 2.94), while another study, 95 participants, utilising the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, did not find a statistically significant difference RR 0.96 (CI 95% 0.54 to 1.71). For adverse events, result favour placebo, four studies, 311 participants, RR 2.90 (Cl 95% 1.23 to 6.86). For drug use, three studies, 211 participants, it was not possible to pool data because outcomes' measures were not comparable. Looking at singular studies, no statistically significant difference was seen. - Comparing different classes of antidepressants, the results favour tricyclics for severity of depression, two studies, 183 participants, RR 1.92 (Cl 95% 1.26 to 2.94) and favour placebo for adverse events, two studies, 172 participants, RR 3.11 (Cl 95% 1.06 to 9.12). There is low evidence, at the present, supporting the clinical use of antidepressants for the treatment of depressed opioid addicts in treatment with opioid agonists. There is a need of larger randomised studies investigating relevant outcomes, safety issues and reporting data to allow comparison of results.","There is little evidence to support the use of antidepressants for treating people who are dependent on opioids and have clinical depression. Depression is more common in people with substance abuse and dependence than in the general population. The depression experienced is also associated with an increased risk of completed suicide. Depression may represent an independent disorder, the psychosocial stress associated with addictive behavior or it could be a consequence of drug use and drug withdrawal effects. A maintenance program with opioid agonists (methadone, buprenorphine, LAAM) is an effective treatment for people who are dependent on opioids in terms of retention in treatment and reduced use of opioids. Depression is however still prevalent and negatively impacts on treatment outcomes. Treatment with antidepressant drugs has therefore been proposed. These adjunct drug treatments include tricyclic antidepressants (doxepin, desipramine, imipramine) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs fluoxetine, sertraline). Authors included seven randomised controlled studies that involved 482 participants in our review. The studies were conducted in outpatient settings over four to 16 weeks; six were in USA and one in Australia. The mean age of participants was 34 years and 62% were males. No clear difference was found in the number of dropouts from an opioid agonist maintenance program between people receiving antidepressants and those in the placebo groups. Neither was drug use different (two studies). Severity of depression was reduced with the use of antidepressants (two studies), including tricyclic antidepressants. Adverse events were important as more of the participants who received antidepressants withdrew from the studies for medical reasons compared with those participants on placebo (four studies). The differences between studies in clinical (participant characteristics, the medications used, services and treatments delivered) and methodological characteristics (study design and quality) made it difficult to draw confident conclusions about the efficacy and safety of antidepressants for the treatment of depression in people who are dependent on opioids.",1118,depression; opioid dependence; opioid agonist treatment; antidepressants; tricyclics; adverse events,How does the presence of depression influence the outcomes of opioid agonist treatments according to the study?,What criteria should future studies meet to improve evidence on the efficacy of antidepressants for opioid-dependent individuals?,Select all of the following that are colors,What is the main conclusion about antidepressant use for opioid dependents?,"In the summary, how did adverse events affect antidepressant use in the studies?",It enhances the retention of participants in treatment programs.; It negatively impacts the treatment outcomes.; It has no significant impact on treatment outcomes.,It negatively impacts the treatment outcomes.,Larger randomized trials with relevant outcome reporting.; Increased focus on drug misuse prevention.; Studies with diverse participant characteristics.,Larger randomized trials with relevant outcome reporting.; Studies with diverse participant characteristics.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Little evidence supports their use; They are highly recommended; They completely cure both addiction and depression,Little evidence supports their use,They led to more study withdrawals; They had no impact on the studies; They improved retention in studies,They led to more study withdrawals
616b5241d8eb9504f10a5cb2,static_2,What are the benefits and risks of using steroids for treating nephrotic syndrome in children?,"In nephrotic syndrome, protein leaks from the blood into the urine through the glomeruli, resulting in hypoproteinaemia and generalised oedema. While most children with nephrotic syndrome respond to corticosteroids, 80% experience a relapsing course. Corticosteroids have reduced the death rate to around 3%; however, corticosteroids have well-recognised potentially serious adverse events such as obesity, poor growth, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, cataracts, glaucoma and behavioural disturbances. This is an update of a review first published in 2000 and updated in 2002, 2005, 2007, 2015 and 2020. The aim of this review was to assess the benefits and harms of different corticosteroid regimens in children with steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SSNS). The benefits and harms of therapy were studied in two groups of children: 1) children in their initial episode of SSNS and 2) children who experience a relapsing course of SSNS. We contacted the Information Specialist and searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 9 July 2024 using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) performed in children (one to 18 years) during their initial or subsequent episode of SSNS, comparing different durations, total doses or other dose strategies using any corticosteroid agent. Summary estimates of effects were obtained using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. In this 2024 update, we included five new studies, resulting in 54 studies randomising 4670 children. Risk of bias methodology was often poorly performed, with only 31 studies and 28 studies respectively assessed to be at low risk for random sequence generation and allocation concealment. Ten studies were at low risk of performance bias (blinding of participants and personnel), and 12 studies were at low risk of detection bias (blinding of outcome assessment); nine of these studies were placebo-controlled RCTs. Twenty-seven studies (fewer than 50%) were at low risk for attrition bias, and 26 studies were at low risk for reporting bias (selective outcome reporting). In studies at low risk of selection bias evaluating children in their initial episode of SSNS, there is little or no difference in the number of children with frequent relapses when comparing two months of prednisone with three months or more (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.10; 755 children, 5 studies; I2= 0%; high certainty evidence) or when comparing three months with five to seven months of therapy (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.33; 376 children, 3 studies; I2= 35%; high certainty evidence). In analyses of studies at low risk of selection bias, there is little or no difference in the number of children with any relapse by 12 to 24 months when comparing two months of prednisone with three months or more (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.06; 808 children; 6 studies; I2= 47%) or when comparing three months with five to seven months of therapy (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.11; 377 children, 3 studies; I2= 53%). Little or no difference was noted in adverse events between the different treatment durations. Amongst children with relapsing SSNS, four small studies (177 children) utilising lower doses of prednisone compared with standard regimens found little or no differences between groups in the numbers with relapse (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.20; I2= 0%). A fifth study (117 children) reported little or no difference between two weeks and four weeks of alternate-day prednisone after remission with daily prednisone. A recent large, well-designed study with 271 children found that administering daily prednisone compared with alternate-day prednisone or no prednisone during viral infection did not reduce the risk of relapse. In contrast, four previous small studies in children with frequently relapsing disease had reported that daily prednisone during viral infections compared with alternate-day prednisone or no treatment reduced the risk of relapse. There are four well-designed studies randomising 823 children, which have demonstrated that there is no benefit of prolonging prednisone therapy beyond two to three months in the first episode of SSNS. Small studies in children with relapsing disease have identified no differences in efficacy using lower induction doses or shorter durations of prednisone therapy. Large, well-designed studies are required to confirm these findings. While previous small studies had suggested that changing from alternate-day to daily prednisone therapy at the onset of infection reduced the likelihood of relapse, a much larger and well-designed study found no reduction in the number relapsing when administering daily prednisone at the onset of infection.","Nephrotic syndrome is a condition in which the kidneys leak protein from the blood into the urine, and if left untreated, children can develop serious infections. In most children, this protein leak stops with steroid treatment because steroids are strong anti-inflammatory medicines, but they can also cause significant side effects such as depression, anxiety, high blood pressure, cataracts, increased infection risk, weight gain, and slowed growth. Children may also experience repeated episodes of nephrotic syndrome, often triggered by viral infections. We wanted to determine the best treatment options for children with nephrotic syndrome to stop protein leakage while avoiding harmful steroid side effects. We searched for all studies that compared the benefits and risks of different steroid regimens in children experiencing nephrotic syndrome for the first time or in those with frequent repeat episodes. We identified 54 studies involving 4670 children from around the world, many from South Asia. Twenty-three studies compared shorter courses of prednisone lasting two to three months with longer courses lasting three to seven months in children experiencing their first episode. The remaining studies looked at children with frequent relapses. We found that longer courses of prednisone (three to seven months) did not meaningfully reduce the chance of a child experiencing another episode or becoming someone who has frequent repeat episodes, compared with shorter two- to three-month courses. The side effects appeared similar between shorter and longer treatments, although many studies did not report this information clearly. Overall, the evidence shows that children experiencing nephrotic syndrome for the first time only need two to three months of prednisone because extending treatment does not lower the risk of relapses. However, we are less confident regarding side effects since many studies did not provide enough usable information.",1085,nephrotic syndrome; hypoproteinaemia; oedema; corticosteroids; steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome; prednisone; glomeruli; alternate-day prednisone; frequently relapsing; remission,Name a motivation for the study according to the plain-language summary.,State a key finding regarding the duration of prednisone treatment.,Select the items that are animals,Explain the goal of reviewing different steroid regimens.,Paraphrase the study's conclusion on treatment duration.,To find the most effective steroid regimens; To determine if steroid therapy is outdated; To evaluate new surgical techniques,To find the most effective steroid regimens,Longer courses reduce the chance of episodes; Shorter courses are as effective as longer courses; Only intravenous doses are effective,Shorter courses are as effective as longer courses,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,To balance efficacy and side effects; To eliminate steroid usage entirely; To improve patient dietary plans,To balance efficacy and side effects,Extending treatment beyond two to three months is unnecessary; Seven-month treatments are significantly better; All patients benefit most from indefinite treatment,Extending treatment beyond two to three months is unnecessary
616b5241d8eb9504f10a5cb2,static_2,Using computers to self-manage type 2 diabetes,"Diabetes is one of the commonest chronic medical conditions, affecting around 347 million adults worldwide. Structured patient education programmes reduce the risk of diabetes-related complications four-fold. Internet-based self-management programmes have been shown to be effective for a number of long-term conditions, but it is unclear what are the essential or effective components of such programmes. If computer-based self-management interventions improve outcomes in type 2 diabetes, they could potentially provide a cost-effective option for reducing the burdens placed on patients and healthcare systems by this long-term condition.
To assess the effects on health status and health-related quality of life of computer-based diabetes self-management interventions for adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
We searched six electronic bibliographic databases for published articles and conference proceedings and three online databases for theses (all up to November 2011). Reference lists of relevant reports and reviews were also screened.
Randomised controlled trials of computer-based self-management interventions for adults with type 2 diabetes, i.e. computer-based software applications that respond to user input and aim to generate tailored content to improve one or more self-management domains through feedback, tailored advice, reinforcement and rewards, patient decision support, goal setting or reminders.
Two review authors independently screened the abstracts and extracted data. A taxonomy for behaviour change techniques was used to describe the active ingredients of the intervention.
We identified 16 randomised controlled trials with 3578 participants that fitted our inclusion criteria. These studies included a wide spectrum of interventions covering clinic-based brief interventions, Internet-based interventions that could be used from home and mobile phone-based interventions. The mean age of participants was between 46 to 67 years old and mean time since diagnosis was 6 to 13 years. The duration of the interventions varied between 1 to 12 months. There were three reported deaths out of 3578 participants. Computer-based diabetes self-management interventions currently have limited effectiveness. They appear to have small benefits on glycaemic control (pooled effect on glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c): -2.3 mmol/mol or -0.2% (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.4 to -0.1; P = 0.009; 2637 participants; 11 trials). The effect size on HbA1c was larger in the mobile phone subgroup (subgroup analysis: mean difference in HbA1c -5.5 mmol/mol or -0.5% (95% CI -0.7 to -0.3); P < 0.00001; 280 participants; three trials). Current interventions do not show adequate evidence for improving depression, health-related quality of life or weight. Four (out of 10) interventions showed beneficial effects on lipid profile. One participant withdrew because of anxiety but there were no other documented adverse effects. Two studies provided limited cost-effectiveness data - with one study suggesting costs per patient of less than $140 (in 1997) or 105 EURO and another study showed no change in health behaviour and resource utilisation.
Computer-based diabetes self-management interventions to manage type 2 diabetes appear to have a small beneficial effect on blood glucose control and the effect was larger in the mobile phone subgroup. There is no evidence to show benefits in other biological outcomes or any cognitive, behavioural or emotional outcomes.","Diabetes is one of the commonest long-term medical conditions, affecting around 347 million adults worldwide. Around 90% of them have type 2 diabetes and are at significant risk of developing diabetes related complications such as strokes or heart attacks. Patient education programmes can reduce the risk of diabetes-related complications, but many people with type 2 diabetes have never attended structured education programmes to learn how to look after themselves (self-management). Better use of computers might be one way of helping more people learn about self-management.
We identified 16 trials involving 3578 adults that met our criteria. These studies included different types of interventions used in different places like touch screen computers in hospital clinics, computers connected to the Internet at home and programmes that communicated with mobile phones. The average age of people taking part was between 46 to 67 years old and most of those people had lived with diabetes for 6 to 13 years. Participants were given access to the interventions for 1 to 12 months, depending on the intervention. Three out of the 3578 participants died but these deaths did not appear to be linked to the trials.
Overall, there is evidence that computer programmes have a small beneficial effect on blood sugar control - the estimated improvement in glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c - a long-term measurement of metabolic control) was 2.3 mmol/mol or 0.2%. This was slightly higher when we looked at studies that used mobile phones to deliver their intervention - the estimated improvement in HbA1c was 5.5 mmol/mol or 0.5% in the studies that used mobile phones. Some of the programmes lowered cholesterol slightly. None of the programmes helped with weight loss or coping with depression.
One participant withdrew because of anxiety but there were no obvious side effects and hypoglycaemic episodes were not reported in any of the studies. There was very little information about costs or value for money.
In summary, existing computer programmes to help adults self-manage type 2 diabetes appear to have a small positive effect on blood sugar control and the mobile phone interventions appeared to have larger effects. There is no evidence to show that current programmes can help with weight loss, depression or improving health-related quality of life but they do appear to be safe.",1003,type 2 diabetes mellitus; glycaemic control; computer-based self-management interventions; glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c); lipid profile; health-related quality of life; computer-based software applications; behaviour change techniques; mobile phone-based interventions; self-management domains,How do the motivations for using computer-based interventions relate to the potential cost-effectiveness in managing type 2 diabetes?,In what ways do the findings reflect a need to redesign future self-management programmes for improved outcomes?,Select all of the following that are colors,Evaluate the significance of glycaemic control improvements achieved through mobile phone interventions compared to other methods.,Summarize the overall effectiveness of computer-based interventions on blood sugar control.,Computer-based interventions can reduce resource burdens on healthcare systems.; They are primarily intended to replace traditional diabetes education programmes.; The goal is to increase the number of hypoglycaemic episodes reported.,Computer-based interventions can reduce resource burdens on healthcare systems.,Focus should be placed on addressing weight loss and depression.; Interventions should decrease reliance on hospital-based touch screen computers.; Current designs should emphasize increasing cholesterol reduction.,Focus should be placed on addressing weight loss and depression.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Mobile interventions yielded superior glycaemic outcomes.; Mobile interventions were less effective than traditional methods.; All methods are equally beneficial.,Mobile interventions yielded superior glycaemic outcomes.,They have a small beneficial effect.; They have a large beneficial effect.; They have no effect.,They have a small beneficial effect.

All randomised controlled trials comparing any type of well-documented aerobic, fitness or progressive resistance training exercise with no exercise in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Two authors independently selected trials, assessed trial quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information. Any information on adverse effects was collected from the trials.
Fourteen randomised controlled trials comparing exercise against no exercise in type 2 diabetes were identified involving 377 participants. Trials ranged from eight weeks to twelve months duration. Compared with the control, the exercise intervention significantly improved glycaemic control as indicated by a decrease in glycated haemoglobin levels of 0.6% (-0.6 % HbA1c, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.9 to -0.3; P < 0.05). This result is both statistically and clinically significant. There was no significant difference between groups in whole body mass, probably due to an increase in fat free mass (muscle) with exercise, as reported in one trial (6.3 kg, 95% CI 0.0 to 12.6). There was a reduction in visceral adipose tissue with exercise (-45.5 cm2, 95% CI -63.8 to -27.3), and subcutaneous adipose tissue also decreased. No study reported adverse effects in the exercise group or diabetic complications. The exercise intervention significantly increased insulin response (131 AUC, 95% CI 20 to 242) (one trial), and decreased plasma triglycerides (-0.25 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.48 to -0.02). No significant difference was found between groups in quality of life (one trial), plasma cholesterol or blood pressure.
The meta-analysis shows that exercise significantly improves glycaemic control and reduces visceral adipose tissue and plasma triglycerides, but not plasma cholesterol, in people with type 2 diabetes, even without weight loss.","Exercise, dietary changes and medications are frequently used in the management of type 2 diabetes. However, it is difficult to determine the independent effect of exercise from some trials because exercise has been combined with dietary modifications or medications, or compared with a control which includes another form of intervention. The review authors aimed to determine the effect of exercise on blood sugar control in type 2 diabetes.This review found that exercise improves blood sugar control and that this effect is evident even without weight loss. Furthermore, exercise decreases body fat content, thus the failure to lose weight with exercise programmes is probably explained by the conversion of fat to muscle. Exercise improved the body's reaction to insulin and decreased blood lipids. Quality of life was only assessed in one study, which found no difference between the two groups. No significant difference was found between groups in blood levels of cholesterol or blood pressure. A total of 14 randomised controlled trials were assessed. These included 377 participants and compared groups that differed only with respect to an exercise programme intervention. The duration of the interventions in the studies ranged from eight weeks to one year. Two studies reported follow-up information, one at six months after the end of the six month exercise intervention and one at twelve months post-intervention. Generally, the studies were well-conducted, but blinding of outcome assessors was not reported and although all studies reported that randomisation was performed, few gave details of the method. No adverse effects with exercise were reported. The effect of exercise on diabetic complications was not assessed in any of the studies.
The relatively short duration of trials prevented the reporting of any significant long term complications or mortality. Another limitation was the small number of participants included in the analyses for adiposity, blood pressure, cholesterol, body's muscle and quality of life.",1001,glycaemic control; glycated haemoglobin; type 2 diabetes mellitus; visceral adipose tissue; plasma triglycerides; exercise intervention; subcutaneous adipose tissue; insulin response; HbA1c; fat free mass,How might researchers justify the clinical relevance of the findings despite no noted weight loss in participants?,What was the main aim of the review authors?,Select all of the following that are fruits,Which outcome did exercise improve in type 2 diabetes management?,What was a significant effect of exercise identified in the trials?,Improvements in insulin response and decreased body fat; Lack of adverse effects from exercise interventions; Extended duration of exercise interventions,Improvements in insulin response and decreased body fat,To determine the effect of exercise on blood sugar control in type 2 diabetes.; To compare dietary and exercise interventions.; To analyze medication effects on type 2 diabetes.,To determine the effect of exercise on blood sugar control in type 2 diabetes.,dog; blue; grape,grape,Blood sugar control; Blood cholesterol levels; Blood pressure,Blood sugar control,Decreased body fat content; Increased overall body weight; Higher energy expenditure,Decreased body fat content
616b5241d8eb9504f10a5cb2,interactive_4,Does random drug and alcohol testing prevent injuries in workers?,"Drug- and alcohol-related impairment in the workplace has been linked to an increased risk of injury for workers. Randomly testing populations of workers for these substances has become a practice in many jurisdictions, with the intention of reducing the risk of workplace incidents and accidents. Despite the proliferation of random drug and alcohol testing (RDAT), there is currently a lack of consensus about whether it is effective at preventing workplace injury, or improving other non-injury accident outcomes in the work place.
To assess the effectiveness of workplace RDAT to prevent injuries and improve non-injury accident outcomes (unplanned events that result in damage or loss of property) in workers compared with no workplace RDAT.
We conducted a systematic literature search to identify eligible published and unpublished studies. The date of the last search was 1 November 2020. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, two other databases, Google Scholar, and three trials registers. We also screened the reference lists of relevant publications known to us.
Study designs that were eligible for inclusion in our review included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-randomised trials (CRTs), interrupted time-series (ITS) studies, and controlled before-after (CBA) studies. Studies needed to evaluate the effectiveness of RDAT in preventing workplace injury or improving other non-injury workplace outcomes. We also considered unpublished data from clinical trial registries. We included employees working in all safety-sensitive occupations, except for commercial drivers, who are the subject of another Cochrane Review.
Independently, two review authors used a data collection form to extract relevant characteristics from the included study. They then analysed a line graph included in the study of the prevalence rate of alcohol violations per year. Independently, the review authors completed a GRADE assessment, as a means of rating the quality of the evidence.
Although our searching originally identified 4198 unique hits, only one study was eligible for inclusion in this review. This was an ITS study that measured the effect of random alcohol testing (RAT) on the test positivity rate of employees of major airlines in the USA from 1995 to 2002. The study included data from 511,745 random alcohol tests, and reported no information about testing for other substances. The rate of positive results was the only outcome of interest reported by the study. The average rate of positive results found by RAT increased from 0.07% to 0.11% when the minimum percentage of workers who underwent RAT annually was reduced from 25% to 10%. Our analyses found this change to be a statistically significant increase (estimated change in level, where the level reflects the average percentage points of positive tests = 0.040, 95% confidence interval 0.005 to 0.075; P = 0.031). Our GRADE assessment, for the observed effect of lower minimum testing percentages associating with a higher rate of positive test results, found the quality of the evidence to be 'very low' across the five GRADE domains. The one included study did not address the following outcomes of interest: fatal injuries; non-fatal injuries; non-injury accidents; absenteeism; and adverse effects associated with RDAT.
In the aviation industry in the USA, the only setting for which the eligible study reported data, there was a statistically significant increase in the rate of positive RAT results following a reduction in the percentage of workers tested, which we deem to be clinically relevant. This result suggests an inverse relationship between the proportion of positive test results and the rate of testing, which is consistent with a deterrent effect for testing. No data were reported on adverse effects related to RDAT. We could not draw definitive conclusions regarding the effectiveness of RDAT for employees in safety-sensitive occupations (not including commercial driving), or with safety-sensitive job functions. We identified only one eligible study that reflected one industry in one country, was of non-randomised design, and tested only for alcohol, not for drugs or other substances. Our GRADE assessment resulted in a 'very low' rating for the quality of the evidence on the only outcome reported. The paucity of eligible research was a major limitation in our review, and additional studies evaluating the effect of RDAT on safety outcomes are needed.","Workplace accidents and injuries happen more often when people's physical abilities and judgement are impaired by drugs or alcohol. The workplace is not usually a place where research is conducted. There are many factors that make it difficult for an employer to measure the impact of a workplace drug testing program on the overarching goal of ensuring a safe workplace. Some employers particularly in sectors where safety is very important, such as the commercial driving and airline industries choose to test workers randomly for drugs and alcohol (random drug and alcohol testing (RDAT)). Through such testing, employers hope to deter employees from inappropriate use of these substances. However, we do not know if RDAT produces the desired effect. We wanted to know whether RDAT in the workplace prevents injuries and unplanned events that result in damage or loss of property (non-injury accidents) compared with no RDAT. We wanted to include all of the relevant research about RDAT in the workplace in our review. We looked for different kinds of published studies that measured how RDAT affected workplace safety. We excluded research on RDAT in commercial drivers, because another Cochrane Review covering these studies has already been published. Two authors from our team examined all of the references identified by our search, but they found only one study that met our selection criteria and could be included in the review. This study investigated random alcohol testing in airline employees in the USA whose jobs included safety-related tasks. The study did not test employees for drugs. Airlines are required by law to test and report on a randomly selected sample of their employees. The study used testing data from between 1995 and 2002. A total of 511,745 random alcohol tests were performed on airline employees. From 1995 to 1997, random tests for alcohol included 25% of the relevant airlines' workforce each year. During this period, the average percentage of employees who tested positive for alcohol was 0.07%. From 1998 to 2002, the proportion of the workforce tested each year dropped to 10%. During this period, the average percentage of employees who tested positive for alcohol increased to 0.11%. This means that when the airlines randomly tested a larger percentage of employees per year, a smaller proportion of them tested positive for alcohol. This relationship between the frequency of alcohol testing and the proportion of positive tests is what we would expect to see if testing has a deterrent effect, though one study alone cannot prove that there is a deterrent effect. This study did not provide any information for other areas of interest to us, specifically: fatal injuries; non-fatal injuries (in which people are physically injured, but do not die); 'non-injury accidents'; that is, accidents in which people are not injured, but property, processes, materials, and/or the environment are damaged; absenteeism; and unwanted, or adverse, events associated with RDAT, including impacts on privacy, confidentiality and employee perceptions. Two of our team rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as number of studies, study size and methods. Overall, our confidence in the evidence was very low. This means we cannot rely on what this study reported to make generalisations about the effectiveness of random alcohol testing alone, or random alcohol testing combined with drug testing (RDAT), in the workplace. We need researchers to do more studies to find the answers.",1058,Random drug and alcohol testing (RDAT); test positivity rate; adverse effects; deterrent effect,What criteria could be used to judge the efficacy of RDAT in preventing non-injury accidents?,What does RDAT stand for in the context of workplace safety?,Select all of the following that are fruits,What was the observed relationship between the percentage of workers tested and the positive test rate?,"According to the summary, what is one potential goal of implementing RDAT in the workplace?",The reduction in reported property damage incidents.; The emotional responses of employees tested.; The change in absenteeism rates post-RDAT implementation.,The reduction in reported property damage incidents.; The change in absenteeism rates post-RDAT implementation.,Random Drug and Alcohol Testing; Routine Daily Activity Tracking; Regulated Dangerous Activity Testing,Random Drug and Alcohol Testing,dog; blue; grape,grape,A higher percentage of workers tested was associated with a lower positive test rate.; A higher percentage of workers tested was associated with a higher positive test rate.; The percentage of workers tested had no impact on the positive test rate.,A higher percentage of workers tested was associated with a lower positive test rate.,To deter inappropriate use of substances among employees.; To increase employee productivity.; To decrease employee turnover.,To deter inappropriate use of substances among employees.
616b5241d8eb9504f10a5cb2,interactive_4,Antidepressants for prevention of winter depression,"Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a seasonal pattern of recurrent major depressive episodes that most commonly occurs during autumn or winter and remits in spring. The prevalence of SAD ranges from 1.5% to 9%, depending on latitude. The predictable seasonal aspect of SAD provides a promising opportunity for prevention. This review - one of four reviews on efficacy and safety of interventions to prevent SAD - focuses on second-generation antidepressants (SGAs). To assess the efficacy and safety of SGAs (in comparison with other SGAs, placebo, light therapy, melatonin or agomelatine, psychological therapies or lifestyle interventions) in preventing SAD and improving patient-centred outcomes among adults with a history of SAD. We searched Ovid MEDLINE (1950- ), Embase (1974- ), PsycINFO (1967- ) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to 19 June 2018. An earlier search of these databases was conducted via the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trial Register (CCMD-CTR) (all years to 11 August 2015). Furthermore, we searched the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database and international trial registers (to 19 June 2018). We also conducted a grey literature search and handsearched the reference lists of included studies and pertinent review articles. For efficacy, we included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on adults with a history of winter-type SAD who were free of symptoms at the beginning of the study. For adverse events, we planned to include non-randomised studies. Eligible studies compared a SGA versus another SGA, placebo, light therapy, psychological therapy, melatonin, agomelatine or lifestyle changes. We also intended to compare SGAs in combination with any of the comparator interventions versus placebo or the same comparator intervention as monotherapy. Two review authors independently screened abstracts and full-text publications, extracted data and assessed risk of bias of included studies. When data were sufficient, we conducted random-effects (Mantel-Haenszel) meta-analyses. We assessed statistical heterogeneity by calculating the Chi2 statistic and the Cochran Q. We used the I2 statistic to estimate the magnitude of heterogeneity. We assessed publication bias by using funnel plots. We rated the strength of the evidence using the system developed by the GRADE Working Group. We identified 3745 citations after de-duplication of search results and excluded 3619 records during title and abstract reviews. We assessed 126 full-text papers for inclusion in the review, of which four publications (on three RCTs) providing data from 1100 people met eligibility criteria for this review. All three RCTs had methodological limitations due to high attrition rates. Overall, moderate-quality evidence indicates that bupropion XL is an efficacious intervention for prevention of recurrence of depressive episodes in people with a history of SAD (risk ratio (RR) 0.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 0.72; 3 RCTs, 1100 participants). However, bupropion XL leads to greater risk of headaches (moderate-quality evidence), insomnia and nausea (both low-quality evidence) when compared with placebo. Numbers needed to treat for additional beneficial outcomes (NNTBs) vary by baseline risks. For a population with a yearly recurrence rate of 30%, the NNTB is 8 (95% CI 6 to 12). For populations with yearly recurrence rates of 50% and 60%, NNTBs are 5 (95% CI 4 to 7) and 4 (95% CI 3 to 6), respectively. We could find no studies on other SGAs and no studies comparing SGAs with other interventions of interest, such as light therapy, psychological therapies, melatonin or agomelatine. Available evidence indicates that bupropion XL is an effective intervention for prevention of recurrence of SAD. Nevertheless, even in a high-risk population, three out of four people will not benefit from preventive treatment with bupropion XL and will be at risk for harm. Clinicians need to discuss with patients advantages and disadvantages of preventive SGA treatment, and might want to consider offering other potentially efficacious interventions, which might confer a lower risk of adverse events. Given the lack of comparative evidence, the decision for or against initiating preventive treatment of SAD and the treatment selected should be strongly based on patient preferences. Future researchers need to assess the effectiveness and risk of harms of SGAs other than bupropion for prevention of SAD. Investigators also need to compare benefits and harms of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions.","Why is this review important? Many people in northern latitudes suffer from winter blues, which occurs as a reaction to reduced sunlight. Three-quarters of those affected are women. Lethargy, overeating, craving for carbohydrates and depressed mood are common symptoms. In some people, winter blues becomes depression, which seriously affects their daily lives. Up to two-thirds experience depressive symptoms every winter. Who will be interested in this review? Anyone who has experienced winter depression. Relatives and friends of people who have experienced winter depression. General practitioners, psychiatrists and pharmacists.  Professionals working in adult mental health services. What questions does this review aim to answer? In light of the seasonal pattern and the high rate of recurrence, beginning antidepressant therapy in early autumn (fall) when people are still free of depressive symptoms can prevent the onset of depressed mood. The goal of this review is to examine whether benefits outweigh harms of antidepressants when they are used in healthy people with a history of winter depression to prevent onset of depression the next winter. To date, this question has not been examined in a systematic way. Which studies were included in the review? We searched databases up to June 2018 for studies on antidepressants given to prevent winter depression. Of 3745 records, we found three randomised controlled studies including 1100 people who received bupropion extended-release (only one of many available antidepressants, but the only one licensed for prevention of winter depression) or placebo. We found no studies on other antidepressants. What does evidence from the review reveal? In populations with a high risk of developing a new depressive episode in the next winter, results show that antidepressants can prevent winter depression in about one in four people. In populations with a lower risk of recurrence, antidepressants can prevent a new depressive episode in one of eight people. The other seven people suffer from winter depression despite treatment or would not have suffered from winter depression anyway. People using antidepressants are at slightly higher risk of experiencing headaches, nausea or insomnia when compared with people not taking antidepressants. Doctors need to discuss with patients the advantages and disadvantages of antidepressants and other potentially preventive treatments for winter depression, such as light treatment, psychological therapies or lifestyle interventions. As no available studies have compared these treatments, the decision for or against preventive treatment of SAD and the treatment selected should be strongly based on patient preferences. What should happen next? Review authors recommend that future studies should directly compare antidepressants against other treatments, such as light therapy, psychological therapies or other drugs to determine the best treatment for preventing winter depression.",1120,Seasonal affective disorder; second-generation antidepressants; bupropion XL; moderate-quality evidence; recurrence of depressive episodes; melatonin; agomelatine; psychological therapies; pharmacological interventions; non-pharmacological interventions,What inference can be made about the population that most benefits from bupropion XL in preventing winter depression?,How does the review suggest doctors should navigate treatment options for SAD?,Select all of the following that are fruits,What conclusion can be drawn about the comparative efficacy of bupropion XL versus other SGAs based on the review findings?,"In the review, which antidepressant was examined for preventing winter depression?",Populations with a yearly recurrence rate of 60%.; Patients who have never experienced depressive symptoms.; Individuals who are symptom-free during spring and summer.,Populations with a yearly recurrence rate of 60%.,By prioritizing drugs like bupropion XL over all other treatments.; By heavily considering patient preferences in treatment decisions.; By providing a one-size-fits-all treatment approach based on clinical guidelines.,By heavily considering patient preferences in treatment decisions.,dog; blue; grape,grape,Bupropion XL is the only SGA proven to prevent winter depression.; There is insufficient evidence to compare bupropion XL to other SGAs.; Other SGAs are less effective than bupropion XL.,There is insufficient evidence to compare bupropion XL to other SGAs.,Fluoxetine; Bupropion extended-release; Sertraline,Bupropion extended-release
616b5241d8eb9504f10a5cb2,finetuned_5,Clopidogrel plus aspirin versus aspirin alone for preventing cardiovascular events,"Aspirin is the prophylactic antiplatelet drug of choice for people with cardiovascular disease. Adding a second antiplatelet drug to aspirin may produce additional benefit for people at high risk and people with established cardiovascular disease. This is an update to a previously published review from 2011.
To review the benefit and harm of adding clopidogrel to aspirin therapy for preventing cardiovascular events in people who have coronary disease, ischaemic cerebrovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, or were at high risk of atherothrombotic disease, but did not have a coronary stent. We updated the searches of CENTRAL (2017, Issue 6), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 4 July 2017) and Embase (Ovid, 1947 to 3 July 2017) on 4 July 2017. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP portal, and handsearched reference lists. We applied no language restrictions. We included all randomised controlled trials comparing over 30 days use of aspirin plus clopidogrel with aspirin plus placebo or aspirin alone in people with coronary disease, ischaemic cerebrovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, or at high risk of atherothrombotic disease. We excluded studies including only people with coronary drug-eluting stent (DES) or non-DES, or both. We collected data on mortality from cardiovascular causes, all-cause mortality, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction, fatal and non-fatal ischaemic stroke, major and minor bleeding. The overall treatment effect was estimated by the pooled risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI), using a fixed-effect model (Mantel-Haenszel); we used a random-effects model in cases of moderate or severe heterogeneity (I2=30%). We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We used GRADE profiler (GRADE Pro) to import data from Review Manager to create a 'Summary of findings' table. The search identified 13 studies in addition to the two studies in the previous version of our systematic review. Overall, we included data from 15 trials with 33,970 people. We completed a 'Risk of bias' assessment for all studies. The risk of bias was low in four trials because they were at low risk of bias for all key domains (random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, selective outcome reporting and incomplete outcome data), even if some of them were funded by the pharmaceutical industry. Analysis showed no difference in the effectiveness of aspirin plus clopidogrel in preventing cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.10; participants = 31,903; studies = 7; moderate quality evidence), and no evidence of a difference in all-cause mortality (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.25; participants = 32,908; studies = 9; low quality evidence). There was a lower risk of fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction with clopidogrel plus aspirin compared with aspirin plus placebo or aspirin alone (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.90; participants = 16,175; studies = 6; moderate quality evidence). There was a reduction in the risk of fatal and non-fatal ischaemic stroke (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.91; participants = 4006; studies = 5; moderate quality evidence). However, there was a higher risk of major bleeding with clopidogrel plus aspirin compared with aspirin plus placebo or aspirin alone (RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.64; participants = 33,300; studies = 10; moderate quality evidence) and of minor bleeding (RR 2.03, 95% CI 1.75 to 2.36; participants = 14,731; studies = 8; moderate quality evidence). Overall, we would expect 13 myocardial infarctions and 23 ischaemic strokes be prevented for every 1000 patients treated with the combination in a median follow-up period of 12 months, but 9 major bleeds and 33 minor bleeds would be caused during a median follow-up period of 10.5 and 6 months, respectively. The available evidence demonstrates that the use of clopidogrel plus aspirin in people at high risk of cardiovascular disease and people with established cardiovascular disease without a coronary stent is associated with a reduction in the risk of myocardial infarction and ischaemic stroke, and an increased risk of major and minor bleeding compared with aspirin alone. According to GRADE criteria, the quality of evidence was moderate for all outcomes except all-cause mortality (low quality evidence) and adverse events (very low quality evidence).","We reviewed the evidence about the effect of clopidogrel and aspirin in people at high risk of getting heart disease or having a stroke, and in those who already have heart disease. Aspirin is widely used to prevent heart disease, but the effects for people at high risk of getting heart disease are small. We wanted to find out whether taking clopidogrel (which is also used to prevent heart disease) and aspirin is better to prevent getting heart disease or having a stroke than taking aspirin alone. We also wanted to find out if people who already had heart disease were at less risk of dying, having a heart attack or stroke if they took clopidogrel and aspirin. This review contains evidence up to July 2017. We found 15 studies which together included more than 30,000 people at high risk of heart disease who are taking aspirin. All studies randomly assigned participants to the intervention group (taking aspirin and clopidogrel) or the control group (taking aspirin and placebo (a pretend treatment that has no effect). Participants took clopidogrel between six weeks and 3.4 years, depending on the study they took part in. The results do not apply to people with recent placement of coronary stents (tubes inserted in the blood vessel to keep it open), who were excluded from this review. The results showed that there is a benefit of adding clopidogrel to aspirin in terms of reducing the risk of heart attack or stroke. However, there is a higher risk of major and minor bleeding associated with this. There was no effect on death due to heart problems or death from any cause. Using Cochrane criteria, four trials were at low risk of bias. Using GRADE standards, the quality of published evidence was moderate for most results, but low for death from any cause and very low for side effects.",1068,antiplatelet drug; cardiovascular disease; coronary disease; ischaemic cerebrovascular disease; peripheral arterial disease; atherothrombotic disease; coronary stent; myocardial infarction; ischaemic stroke; major bleeding,What was the primary motivation for the study?,What outcome was observed with adding clopidogrel to aspirin?,Select all of the following that are colors,Which adverse effect was noted when combining clopidogrel with aspirin?,,To assess whether adding clopidogrel to aspirin reduces heart disease risk.; To examine the impact of aspirin on coronary stents.; To determine the best time to take aspirin daily.,To assess whether adding clopidogrel to aspirin reduces heart disease risk.,Reduced risk of heart attack or stroke.; Increased risk of coronary stent complications.; Enhanced performance in physical activities.,Reduced risk of heart attack or stroke.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Higher risk of major and minor bleeding.; Increased likelihood of headaches.; Lower risk of developing high blood pressure.,Higher risk of major and minor bleeding.,,
616b5241d8eb9504f10a5cb2,finetuned_6,First-line treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer identified as being EGFR mutation positive,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation positive (M+) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is an important subtype of lung cancer comprising 10% to 15% of non-squamous tumours. This subtype is more common in women than men, is less associated with smoking, but occurs at a younger age than sporadic tumours.
To assess the clinical effectiveness of single-agent or combination EGFR therapies used in the first-line treatment of people with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR M+ NSCLC compared with other cytotoxic chemotherapy (CTX) agents used alone or in combination, or best supportive care (BSC). The primary outcomes were overall survival and progression-free survival. Secondary outcomes included response rate, symptom palliation, toxicity, and health-related quality of life.
We conducted electronic searches of the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2020, Issue 7), MEDLINE (1946 to 27th July 2020), Embase (1980 to 27th July 2020), and ISI Web of Science (1899 to 27th July 2020). We also searched the conference abstracts of the American Society for Clinical Oncology and the European Society for Medical Oncology (July 2020); Evidence Review Group submissions to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence; and the reference lists of retrieved articles.
Parallel-group randomised controlled trials comparing EGFR-targeted agents (alone or in combination with cytotoxic agents or BSC) with cytotoxic chemotherapy (single or doublet) or BSC in chemotherapy-naive patients with locally advanced or metastatic (stage IIIB or IV) EGFR M+ NSCLC unsuitable for treatment with curative intent.
Two review authors independently identified articles, extracted data, and carried out the 'Risk of bias' assessment. We conducted meta-analyses using a fixed-effect model unless there was substantial heterogeneity, in which case we also performed a random-effects analysis as a sensitivity analysis.
Twenty-two trials met the inclusion criteria. Ten of these exclusively recruited people with EGFR M+ NSCLC; the remainder recruited a mixed population and reported results for people with EGFR M+ NSCLC as subgroup analyses. The number of participants with EGFR M+ tumours totalled 3023, of whom approximately 2563 were of Asian origin. Overall survival (OS) data showed inconsistent results between the included trials that compared EGFR-targeted treatments against cytotoxic chemotherapy or placebo. Erlotinib was used in eight trials, gefitinib in nine trials, afatinib in two trials, cetuximab in two trials, and icotinib in one trial. The findings of FASTACT 2 suggested a clinical benefit for OS for participants treated with erlotinib plus cytotoxic chemotherapy when compared to cytotoxic chemotherapy alone, as did the Han 2017 trial for gefitinib plus cytotoxic chemotherapy, but both results were based on a small number of participants (n = 97 and 122, respectively). For progression-free survival (PFS), a pooled analysis of four trials showed evidence of clinical benefit for erlotinib compared with cytotoxic chemotherapy (hazard ratio (HR) 0.31; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25 to 0.39 ; 583 participants ; high-certainty evidence). A pooled analysis of two trials of gefitinib versus paclitaxel plus carboplatin showed evidence of clinical benefit for PFS for gefitinib (HR 0.39; 95% CI 0.32 to 0.48 ; 491 participants high-certainty evidence), and a pooled analysis of two trials of gefitinib versus pemetrexed plus carboplatin with pemetrexed maintenance also showed evidence of clinical benefit for PFS for gefitinib (HR 0.59; 95% CI 0.46 to 0.74, 371 participants ; moderate-certainty evidence). Afatinib showed evidence of clinical benefit for PFS when compared with chemotherapy in a pooled analysis of two trials (HR 0.42; 95% CI 0.34 to 0.53, 709 participants high-certainty evidence). All but one small trial showed a corresponding improvement in response rate with tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) compared to chemotherapy. Commonly reported grade 3/4 adverse events associated with afatinib, erlotinib, gefitinib and icotinib monotherapy were rash and diarrhoea. Myelosuppression was consistently worse in the chemotherapy arms; fatigue and anorexia were also associated with some chemotherapies. Seven trials reported on health-related quality of life and symptom improvement using different methodologies. For each of erlotinib, gefitinib, and afatinib, two trials showed improvement in one or more indices for the TKI compared to chemotherapy. The quality of evidence was high for the comparisons of erlotinib and gefitinib with cytotoxic chemotherapy and for the comparison of afatinib with cytotoxic chemotherapy.
Erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib and icotinib are all active agents in EGFR M+ NSCLC patients, and demonstrate an increased tumour response rate and prolonged PFS compared to cytotoxic chemotherapy. We found a beneficial effect of the TKI compared to cytotoxic chemotherapy in adverse effect and health-related quality of life. We found limited evidence for increased OS for the TKI when compared with standard chemotherapy, but the majority of the included trials allowed participants to switch treatments on disease progression, which will have a confounding effect on any OS analysis. Single agent-TKI remains the standard of care and the benefit of combining a TKI and chemotherapy remains uncertain as the evidence is based on small patient numbers. Cytotoxic chemotherapy is less effective in EGFR M+ NSCLC than erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib or icotinib and is associated with greater toxicity. There are no data supporting the use of monoclonal antibody therapy. Icotinib is not available outside China.","Lung cancer is the most common cancer in the world. It has often spread by the time it is diagnosed. Therefore, surgery is usually not possible and drug treatment, typically chemotherapy, is needed. The commonest type of lung cancer is non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Around 10% to 15% of people with NSCLC will have a specific kind of cancer known as epidermal growth factor receptor positive (EGFR M+), in which there are changes in the cancer cells to the genes controlling tumour growth. In this review, we looked at new treatments that can target EGFR M+ NSCLC to find out how well they work.
The purpose of this review was to find out whether people given treatments targeted at EGFR M+ NSCLC live longer and have a better health-related quality of life than people having standard chemotherapy.
We found 22 trials that looked at five different EGFR-targeted drugs and compared them with standard chemotherapy treatment: erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib, icotinib and the antibody cetuximab. We included trials reporting results up to 27 July 2020.
Our results showed that people given erlotinib, gefitinib,afatinib or icotinib have a longer time before the cancer progresses and experience fewer side effects than those people given standard chemotherapy. However, we could not be sure whether people given erlotinib, afatinib or icotinib live any longer than those given standard chemotherapy.
Erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib and icotinib delay further spread of EGFR M+ lung cancer and improve health-related quality of life.

616b5241d8eb9504f10a5cb2,finetuned_6,Interventions to prevent or reduce kidney complications in people with sickle cell disease,"Sickle cell disease (SCD), one of the commonest severe monogenic disorders, is caused by the inheritance of two abnormal haemoglobin (beta-globin) genes. SCD can cause severe pain, significant end-organ damage, pulmonary complications, and premature death. Kidney disease is a frequent and potentially severe complication in people with SCD. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined as abnormalities of kidney structure or function present for more than three months. Sickle cell nephropathy refers to the spectrum of kidney complications in SCD. Glomerular damage is a cause of microalbuminuria and can develop at an early age in children with SCD, with increased prevalence in adulthood. In people with sickle cell nephropathy, outcomes are poor as a result of the progression to proteinuria and chronic kidney insufficiency. Up to 12% of people who develop sickle cell nephropathy will develop end-stage renal disease. This is an update of a review first published in 2017. To assess the effectiveness of any intervention for preventing or reducing kidney complications or chronic kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease. Possible interventions include red blood cell transfusions, hydroxyurea, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), either alone or in combination. We searched for relevant trials in the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, seven other databases, and two other trials registers. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing interventions to prevent or reduce kidney complications or CKD in people with SCD. We applied no restrictions related to outcomes examined, language, or publication status. Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility, extracted data, assessed the risk of bias, and assessed the certainty of the evidence (GRADE). We included three RCTs with 385 participants. We rated the certainty of the evidence as low to very low across different outcomes according to GRADE methodology, downgrading for risk of bias concerns, indirectness, and imprecision. Hydroxyurea versus placebo One RCT published in 2011 compared hydroxyurea to placebo in 193 children aged nine to 18 months. We are unsure if hydroxyurea compared to placebo reduces or prevents progression of kidney disease assessed by change in glomerular filtration rate (mean difference (MD) 0.58 mL/min /1.73 m2, 95% confidence interval (CI) -14.60 to 15.76; 142 participants; very low certainty). Hydroxyurea compared to placebo may improve the ability to concentrate urine (MD 42.23 mOsm/kg, 95% CI 12.14 to 72.32; 178 participants; low certainty), and may make little or no difference to SCD-related serious adverse events, including acute chest syndrome (risk ratio (RR) 0.39, 99% CI 0.13 to 1.16; 193 participants; low certainty), painful crisis (RR 0.68, 99% CI 0.45 to 1.02; 193 participants; low certainty); and hospitalisations (RR 0.83, 99% CI 0.68 to 1.01; 193 participants; low certainty). No deaths occurred in either trial arm and the RCT did not report quality of life. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors versus placebo One RCT published in 1998 compared an ACEI (captopril) to placebo in 22 adults with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. We are unsure if captopril compared to placebo reduces proteinuria (MD -124.10 to 26.10; 22 participants; very low certainty). We are unsure if captopril reduces or prevents kidney disease as measured by creatinine clearance; the trial authors stated that creatinine clearance remained constant over six months in both groups, but provided no comparative data (very low certainty). The RCT did not report serious adverse events, all-cause mortality, or quality of life. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors versus vitamin C One RCT published in 2020 compared an ACEI (lisinopril)with vitamin C in 170 children aged one to 18 years with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. It reported no data we could analyse. We are unsure if lisinopril compared to vitamin C reduces proteinuria in this population: the large drop in microalbuminuria in both arms of the trial after only one month on treatment may have been due to an overestimation of microalbuminuria at baseline rather than a true effect. The RCT did not report serious adverse events, all-cause mortality, or quality of life. We are unsure if hydroxyurea improves glomerular filtration rate or reduces hyperfiltration in children aged nine to 18 months, but it may improve their ability to concentrate urine and may make little or no difference to the incidence of acute chest syndrome, painful crises, and hospitalisations. We are unsure if ACEI compared to placebo has any effect on preventing or reducing kidney complications in adults with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. We are unsure if ACEI compared to vitamin C has any effect on preventing or reducing kidney complications in children with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. No RCTs assessed red blood cell transfusions or any combined interventions to prevent or reduce kidney complications. Due to lack of evidence, we cannot comment on the management of children aged over 18 months or adults with any known genotype of SCD. We have identified a lack of adequately designed and powered studies, although we found four ongoing trials since the last version of this review. Only one ongoing trial addresses renal function as a primary outcome in the short term, but such interventions have long-term effects. Trials of hydroxyurea, ACEIs or red blood cell transfusion in older children and adults are urgently needed to determine any effect on prevention or reduction of kidney complications in people with SCD.","SCD is a serious inherited blood disorder where the red blood cells, which carry oxygen around the body, develop abnormally. Normal red blood cells are flexible and disc-shaped, but sickled cells are rigid and crescent-shaped, and stickier than normal red blood cells. This can lead to blockage of blood vessels, resulting in tissue and organ damage and episodes of severe pain. The abnormal cells are fragile and break apart easily, which leads to a decreased number of red blood cells, known as anaemia.Kidney complications can start at an early age in children with SCD and are common in adults with the condition. Kidney complications leading to kidney protein leak and chronic kidney disease can be severe, with serious effects on health. Severe complications include the need for dialysis (a procedure to remove waste products and excess fluid from the blood when the kidneys stop working properly) or a kidney transplant. Identifying therapies that can prevent or slow down the decline in kidney function in people with SCD is critical for improving health outcomes. The evidence is current to 22 September 2022. We found three randomised controlled trials, which enroled a total of 385 people. One trial, published in 2011, compared the drug hydroxyurea (which helps to maintain the shape and flexibility of red blood cells), to placebo (dummy treatment) in 193 children aged nine to 18 months. The second trial, published in 1998, compared captopril (a drug used to treat high blood pressure) to placebo in 22 adults with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria (high levels of protein in the urine). The third trial, published in 2020, compared lisinopril (a drug used to treat high blood pressure) to vitamin C in 170 children aged one to 18 years. Two trials received government funding; it was unclear how the third trial was funded. We have little or very little confidence in the evidence because we only found three trials, and they had specific populations (only children or only adults), few participants, and wide variations in results.",1089,Sickle cell disease; monogenic disorders; haemoglobin; chronic kidney disease; sickle cell nephropathy; microalbuminuria; end-stage renal disease; glomerular filtration rate; acute chest syndrome; painful crisis,What condition does sickle cell disease primarily affect?,Identify a key characteristic of red blood cells in people with SCD.,Select the items that are animals,What is the main purpose of the reviewed trials in the study?,What serious kidney complication can arise from SCD?,Red blood cells; White blood cells; Blood platelets,Red blood cells,Flexible and disc-shaped; Rigid and crescent-shaped; Irregular and square-shaped,Rigid and crescent-shaped,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,To prevent kidney protein leak; To slow kidney function decline; To cure SCD,To slow kidney function decline,Kidney stones; Need for dialysis or kidney transplant; Urinary tract infections,Need for dialysis or kidney transplant
60c969c12749ced10866921d,static_1,Best therapy for people with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who have not been treated without a targetable mutation and moderately impaired performance status,"Most people who are newly diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have advanced disease. For these people, survival is determined by various patient- and tumor-related factors, of which the performance status (PS) is the most important prognostic factor. People with PS 0 or 1 are usually treated with systemic therapies, whereas people with PS 3 or 4 most often receive supportive care. However, treatment for people with PS 2 without a targetable mutation remains unclear. Historically, people with a PS 2 cancer are frequently excluded from (important) clinical trials because of poorer outcomes and increased toxicity. We aim to address this knowledge gap, as this group of people represents a significant proportion (20% to 30%) of the total population with newly diagnosed lung cancer.
To identify the best first-line therapy for advanced lung cancer in people with performance status 2 without a targetable mutation or with an unknown mutation status.
We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. 
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared different chemotherapy (with or without angiogenesis inhibitor) or immunotherapy regimens, specifically designed for people with PS 2 only or studies including a subgroup of these people.
We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. overall survival (OS), 2. health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and 3. toxicity/adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were 4. tumor response rate, 5. progression-free survival, and 6. survival rates at six and 12 months' treatment. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence for each outcome.
We included 22 trials in this review and identified one ongoing trial. Twenty studies compared chemotherapy with different regimens, of which 11 compared non-platinum therapy (monotherapy or doublet) versus platinum doublet. We found no studies comparing best supportive care with chemotherapy and only two abstracts analyzing chemotherapy versus immunotherapy. We found that platinum doublet therapy showed superior OS compared to non-platinum therapy (hazard ratio [HR] 0.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.57 to 0.78; 7 trials, 697 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There were no differences in six-month survival rates (risk ratio [RR] 1.00, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.41; 6 trials, 632 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), whereas 12-month survival rates were improved for treatment with platinum doublet therapy (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.87 to 0.97; 11 trials, 1567 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). PFS and tumor response rate were also better for people treated with platinum doublet therapy, with moderate-certainty evidence (PFS: HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.77; 5 trials, 487 participants; tumor response rate: RR 2.25, 95% CI 1.67 to 3.05; 9 trials, 964 participants). When analyzing toxicity rates, we found that platinum doublet therapy increased grade 3 to 5 hematologic toxicities, all with low-certainty evidence (anemia: RR 1.98, 95% CI 1.00 to 3.92; neutropenia: RR 2.75, 95% CI 1.30 to 5.82; thrombocytopenia: RR 3.96, 95% CI 1.73 to 9.06; all 8 trials, 935 participants). Only four trials reported HRQoL data; however, the methodology was different per trial and we were unable to perform a meta-analysis. Although evidence is limited, there were no differences in 12-month survival rates or tumor response rates between carboplatin and cisplatin regimens. With an indirect comparison, carboplatin seemed to have better 12-month survival rates than cisplatin compared to non-platinum therapy. The assessment of the efficacy of immunotherapy in people with PS 2 was limited. There might be a place for single-agent immunotherapy, but the data provided by the included studies did not encourage the use of double-agent immunotherapy.
This review showed that as a first-line treatment for people with PS 2 with advanced NSCLC, platinum doublet therapy seems to be preferred over non-platinum therapy, with a higher response rate, PFS, and OS. Although the risk for grade 3 to 5 hematologic toxicity is higher, these events are often relatively mild and easy to treat. Since trials using checkpoint inhibitors in people with PS 2 are scarce, we identified an important knowledge gap regarding their role in people with advanced NSCLC and PS 2.","Lung cancer is the most frequent cause of cancer-related death worldwide and NSCLC is the most common subtype. At the time of diagnosis, the disease has already spread in more than half of all cases. In the tumors of a minority of people diagnosed with NSCLC that has spread to other parts of the body specific mutations can be found, which are treated distinct from the majority of people without such mutations.
NSCLC can only be treated with life-prolonging medicines such as chemotherapy (a medicine used to destroy cancer cells) or immunotherapy (a medicine that boosts the person's immune system and helps the body find and destroy cancer cells). Selecting the best treatment depends on the health condition of the person. That condition is determined using a scale from 0 (no symptoms) to 5 (dead). There is no discussion on the treatment of relatively fit people (scoring 0 or 1), as they often tolerate these treatments relatively well. People with a low health condition (scoring 3 or 4) receive only supportive care in most cases. However, although representing 20% to 30% of all people, the best treatment for moderately impaired people (PS 2) is not clear, as they often do not participate in trials.
Our objective was to investigate the best therapy for people with advanced NSCLC without a specific mutation with PS 2.
We searched medical databases for clinical trials comparing treatments for advanced NSCLC with best supportive care or other treatments.
We found 22 trials; 20 compared different types of chemotherapy and two compared chemotherapy versus immunotherapy.
People treated with chemotherapy regimens using two medicines, including a platinum-based medicine, had longer survival than people treated with chemotherapies without a platinum-based medicine. However, these people did have more side effects, especially with a negative influence on the bone marrow (matter found in the center of bones), resulting in a temporary lack of red and white blood cells, and platelets. The few studies that analyzed health-related quality of life all used different methods of measurement. We found no difference in quality of life when we looked at those studies individually. We found two partly published trials studying immunotherapy, which found no survival benefit compared to chemotherapy.
We are moderately confident in our results that chemotherapies with a platinum-based medicine increases survival. We are also moderately confident in the evidence evaluating the time to progression of disease because in all included studies, both investigators and trial participants were fully aware of which treatment the participants received. This might lead to substantial bias. In addition, we have little confidence in the evidence regarding toxicities because the evidence is based on a small number of studies with conflicting outcomes.",1023,non-small cell lung cancer; performance status; targetable mutation; immunotherapy regimens; overall survival; health-related quality of life; progression-free survival; tumor response rate; platinum doublet therapy; hematologic toxicities,What are the underlying motivations for focusing on people with performance status 2 in the study of NSCLC treatments?,How did the study distinguish between the effects of platinum-based chemotherapy versus non-platinum regimens?,Select the items that are animals,Critique the robustness of the studyÃ¢ÂÂs conclusions regarding immunotherapy for PS 2 patients.,What is the primary aim of the study discussed in the plain-language summary?,"They often tolerate treatment well, similar to those with PS 0 or 1.; They represent a significant but often neglected portion of NSCLC cases.; They are frequently included in clinical trials, which simplifies research.",They represent a significant but often neglected portion of NSCLC cases.,It demonstrated improved survival outcomes with platinum-based regimens.; It showed no difference in tumor response rates.; It highlighted consistent quality of life improvements with non-platinum regimens.,It demonstrated improved survival outcomes with platinum-based regimens.,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,The study robustly proves the superiority of immunotherapy over chemotherapy.; The evidence for the efficacy of immunotherapy was limited.; The study found clear benefits of double-agent immunotherapy.,The evidence for the efficacy of immunotherapy was limited.,To find the best therapy for people with PS 2 in advanced NSCLC without a specific mutation; To develop a new platinum-based chemotherapy drug; To compare supportive care with chemotherapy,To find the best therapy for people with PS 2 in advanced NSCLC without a specific mutation
60c969c12749ced10866921d,static_2,Treatment with macrolide antibiotics (including azithromycin) for people with cystic fibrosis,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-limiting genetic condition, affecting over 90,000 people worldwide. CF affects several organs in the body, but airway damage has the most profound impact on quality of life (QoL) and survival. Causes of lower airway infection in people with CF are, most notably, Staphylococcus aureus in the early course of the disease and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at a later stage. Macrolide antibiotics, e.g. azithromycin and clarithromycin, are usually taken orally, have a broad spectrum of action against gram-positive (e.g. S aureus) and some gram-negative bacteria (e.g. Haemophilus influenzae), and may have a modifying role in diseases involving airway infection and inflammation such as CF. They are well-tolerated and relatively inexpensive, but widespread use has resulted in the emergence of resistant bacteria. To assess the potential effects of macrolide antibiotics on clinical status in terms of benefit and harm in people with CF. If benefit was demonstrated, we aimed to assess the optimal type, dose and duration of macrolide therapy. We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearching relevant journals, and abstract books of conference proceedings. We last searched the Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register on 2 November 2022. We last searched the trial registries WHO ICTRP and clinicaltrials.gov on 9 November 2022. We contacted investigators known to work in the field, previous authors and pharmaceutical companies manufacturing macrolide antibiotics for unpublished or follow-up data, where possible. We included randomised controlled trials of macrolide antibiotics in adults and children with CF. We compared them to: placebo; another class of antibiotic; another macrolide antibiotic; or the same macrolide antibiotic at a different dose or type of administration. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. We included 14 studies (1467 participants) lasting 28 days to 36 months. All the studies assessed azithromycin: 11 compared oral azithromycin to placebo (1167 participants); one compared a high dose to a low dose (47 participants); one compared nebulised to oral azithromycin (45 participants); and one looked at weekly versus daily dose (208 participants). Oral azithromycin versus placebo There is a slight improvement in forced expiratory volume (FEV1% predicted) in one second in the azithromycin group at up to six months compared to placebo (mean difference (MD) 3.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.74 to 6.19; high-certainty evidence), although there is probably no difference at three months, (MD 2.70%, 95% CI -0.12 to 5.52), or 12 months (MD -0.13, 95% CI -4.96 to 4.70). Participants in the azithromycin group are probably at a decreased risk of pulmonary exacerbation with a longer time to exacerbation (hazard ratio (HR) 0.61, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.75; moderate-certainty evidence). Mild side effects were common, but there was no difference between groups (moderate-certainty evidence). There is no difference in hospital admissions at six months (odds ratio (OR) 0.61, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.04; high-certainty evidence), or in new acquisition of P aeruginosa at 12 months (HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.55; moderate-certainty evidence). High-dose versus low-dose azithromycin We are uncertain whether there is any difference in FEV1% predicted at six months between the two groups (no data available) or in the rate of exacerbations per child per month (MD -0.05 (95% CI -0.20 to 0.10)); very low-certainty evidence for both outcomes. Only children were included in the study and the study did not report on any of our other clinically important outcomes. Nebulised azithromycin versus oral azithromycin We were unable to include any of the data into our analyses and have reported findings directly from the paper; we graded all evidence as being of very low certainty. The authors reported that there was a greater mean change in FEV1% predicted at one month in the nebulised azithromycin group (P < 0.001). We are uncertain whether there was a change in P aeruginosa count. Weekly azithromycin versus daily azithromycin There is probably a lower mean change in FEV1% predicted at six months in the weekly group compared to the daily group (MD -0.70, 95% CI -0.95 to -0.45) and probably also a longer period of time until first exacerbation in the weekly group (MD 17.30 days, 95% CI 4.32 days to 30.28 days). Gastrointestinal side effects are probably more common in the weekly group and there is likely no difference in admissions to hospital or QoL. We graded all evidence as moderate certainty. Azithromycin therapy is associated with a small but consistent improvement in respiratory function, a decreased risk of exacerbation and longer time to exacerbation at six months; but evidence for treatment efficacy beyond six months remains limited. Azithromycin appears to have a good safety profile (although a weekly dose was associated with more gastrointestinal side effects, which makes it less acceptable for long-term therapy), with a relatively minimal treatment burden for people with CF, and it is inexpensive. A wider concern may be the emergence of macrolide resistance reported in the most recent study which, combined with the lack of long-term data, means we do not feel that the current evidence is strong enough to support azithromycin therapy for all people with CF. Future research should report over longer time frames using validated tools and consistent reporting, to allow for easier synthesis of data. In particular, future trials should report important adverse events such as hearing impairment or liver disease. More data on the effects of azithromycin given in different ways and reporting on our primary outcomes would benefit decision-making on whether and how to give macrolide antibiotics. Finally, it is important to assess azithromycin therapy for people with CF who are established on the relatively new cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator therapies which correct the underlying molecular defect associated with CF (none of the trials included in the review are relevant to this population).","What are the effects of macrolide antibiotics in people with cystic fibrosis (CF) and infection of their airways? People with CF suffer from infections in their airways, often caused by the bug Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is resistant to nearly all antibiotics that can be swallowed (oral). Macrolide antibiotics, e.g. azithromycin and clarithromycin, have no direct killing effect on Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but they may reduce the activity of these bacteria. We wanted to discover whether the use of macrolide antibiotics (usually taken orally) affected the health of people with CF and whether these drugs have any side effects.
We searched for studies that looked at the effects of macrolide antibiotics in children and adults with CF and summarised the evidence. We found 14 studies, which put the total of 1467 children and adults into different treatment groups at random, which we included in this review. Eleven studies compared azithromycin to placebo, one compared two different doses of azithromycin (high versus low dose), one compared inhaled azithromycin to oral azithromycin, and one compared oral azithromycin once a week to once a day. We found that there was a slight improvement in lung function in people that were given azithromycin compared to a placebo at six months and also that the risk of a flare-up of infection was lower. The risk of side effects (such as vomiting, diarrhoea and headache) was similar in both groups, as was the chance of a new infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In terms of lung function and flare-up of infection, we were unsure whether a higher dose of azithromycin is better than a lower dose (but only one study in children examined dose), or whether inhaled azithromycin is better than oral azithromycin. Taking oral azithromycin once a week compared to every day probably leads to less of an improvement in lung function, but there is probably a longer time to a flare-up in the weekly group. We were unable to combine all the study results because they were measured in different ways and at different time points; future trials should address this issue. Also, now that many people with CF are being treated with the new modulator therapies (e.g. elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor), it is important to assess how macrolide antibiotics affect the health of these people. In the studies we found for this review, none of the people taking part were being treated with modulator therapies. We are able to report the results of the studies that compared azithromycin to placebo with certainty as the studies were well conducted and included a larger number of participants. The evidence from the studies comparing high and low doses or nebulised and oral azithromycin was much less certain because the studies were small and there was risk of bias in the way they were carried out. We were moderately certain of the results of the study comparing weekly azithromycin to daily azithromycin.",1076,Cystic fibrosis; Staphylococcus aureus; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; macrolide antibiotics; azithromycin; clarithromycin; forced expiratory volume; pulmonary exacerbation; cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; CFTR modulator therapies,What is the primary health issue that macrolide antibiotics aim to address in people with cystic fibrosis?,"Which bacterial infection is particularly problematic for people with cystic fibrosis, according to the summary?",Select all of the following that are colors,What is one known effect of macrolide antibiotics on lung function in people with cystic fibrosis?,"According to the study, what was a finding regarding the risk of infection flare-up when using azithromycin?",Infections in their airways; Heart disease; Diabetes,Infections in their airways,Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Escherichia coli; Streptococcus pneumoniae,Pseudomonas aeruginosa,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Slight improvement at six months; Deterioration at six months; No effect at six months,Slight improvement at six months,The risk was lower compared to placebo; The risk was higher compared to placebo; The risk was unchanged compared to placebo,The risk was lower compared to placebo
60c969c12749ced10866921d,static_2,"Thymic peptides for treatment of cancer patients in addition to chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or both","Purified thymus extracts (pTE) and synthetic thymic peptides (sTP) are thought to enhance the immune system of cancer patients to help fight tumour growth and reduce infections caused by disease-related or treatment-related immunosuppression. This review evaluated the effectiveness of pTE and sTP for cancer management. Researchers searched major medical databases up to February 2010 for randomized trials in adult cancer patients where pTE or sTP were added to chemotherapy or radiotherapy and compared with the same regimen alone or with placebo. Data were independently extracted by two authors, and odds ratios were calculated for overall survival, disease-free survival, tumour response, and adverse effects. A random-effects model was used. Twenty-six trials involving 2736 patients were identified: 20 trials investigated pTE (thymostimulin or thymosin fraction 5) and six investigated sTP (thymopentin or thymosin ?1). Twenty-one trials reported overall survival, six reported disease-free survival, 14 reported tumour response, nine reported adverse effects, and 10 reported safety. Adding pTE showed no benefit for overall survival (RR 1.00), disease-free survival (RR 0.97), or tumour response (RR 1.07), with moderate to high heterogeneity. For thymosin ?1, the pooled RR for overall survival was 1.21 and for disease-free survival was 3.37, though neither result reached statistical significance. pTE reduced the risk of severe infectious complications (RR 0.54), and thymostimulin showed a non-significant trend toward reduced severe neutropenia. Both pTE and sTP were generally well tolerated. Many trials had at least moderate risk of bias. Overall, there is no clear evidence that adding pTE to cancer treatment improves survival or tumour response, although thymosin ?1 showed a possible trend toward benefit. There is preliminary evidence that pTE may reduce severe infectious complications during chemotherapy or radiotherapy.","The immune system plays a key role in the body's own defences against cancer cells. The thymus gland plays a central part in this and modifies T-cells, a subset of lymphocytes. Studies with thymic peptides have shown a variety of effects on the immune system. There are two groups of thymic peptides available for use in treatment: purified extracts from animal (mostly calf) thymus glands and synthetically produced thymus gland peptides.
This review aims to answer the question whether having thymic peptides can improve the response to and tolerability of standard chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or combined treatment. Further questions are whether the peptides inhibit or reduce the progression and recurrence of disease, whether they prolong the life of cancer patients and whether quality of life is improved. This review looked at the evidence from 26 clinical trials with a total of 2736 adult cancer patients. Many of the trials were small and of moderate quality. Only three studies were less than 10 years old. Thymosin ?1 is a synthetic peptide that shows some promise as a treatment option for patients with metastatic melanoma when used in addition to chemotherapy.

60c969c12749ced10866921d,interactive_3,Bisphosphonates and denosumab for breast cancer,"Bone is the most common site of metastatic disease associated with breast cancer (BC). Bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, and novel targeted therapies such as denosumab inhibit other key bone metabolism pathways. We have studied these agents in both early breast cancer and advanced breast cancer settings. This is an update of the review originally published in 2002 and subsequently updated in 2005 and 2012.
To assess the effects of bisphosphonates and other bone agents in addition to anti-cancer treatment: (i) in women with early breast cancer (EBC); (ii) in women with advanced breast cancer without bone metastases (ABC); and (iii) in women with metastatic breast cancer and bone metastases (BCBM).
In this review update, we searched Cochrane Breast Cancer's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov on 19 September 2016.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing: (a) one treatment with a bisphosphonate/bone-acting agent with the same treatment without a bisphosphonate/bone-acting agent; (b) treatment with one bisphosphonate versus treatment with a different bisphosphonate; (c) treatment with a bisphosphonate versus another bone-acting agent of a different mechanism of action (e.g. denosumab); and (d) immediate treatment with a bisphosphonate/bone-acting agent versus delayed treatment of the same bisphosphonate/bone-acting agent.
Two review authors independently extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and quality of the evidence. The primary outcome measure was bone metastases for EBC and ABC, and a skeletal-related event (SRE) for BCBM. We derived risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and the meta-analyses used random-effects models. Secondary outcomes included overall survival and disease-free survival for EBC; we derived hazard ratios (HRs) for these time-to-event outcomes where possible. We collected toxicity and quality-of-life information. GRADE was used to assess the quality of evidence for the most important outcomes in each treatment setting.
We included 44 RCTs involving 37,302 women. In women with EBC, bisphosphonates were associated with a reduced risk of bone metastases compared to placebo/no bisphosphonate (RR 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75 to 0.99; P = 0.03, 11 studies; 15,005 women; moderate-quality evidence with no significant heterogeneity). Bisphosphonates provided an overall survival benefit with time-to-event data (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.99; P = 0.04; 9 studies; 13,949 women; high-quality evidence with evidence of heterogeneity). Subgroup analysis by menopausal status showed a survival benefit from bisphosphonates in postmenopausal women (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.90; P = 0.001; 4 studies; 6048 women; high-quality evidence with no evidence of heterogeneity) but no survival benefit for premenopausal women (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.22; P = 0.78; 2 studies; 3501 women; high-quality evidence with no heterogeneity). There was evidence of no effect of bisphosphonates on disease-free survival (HR 0.94, 95% 0.87 to 1.02; P = 0.13; 7 studies; 12,578 women; high-quality evidence with significant heterogeneity present) however subgroup analyses showed a disease-free survival benefit from bisphosphonates in postmenopausal women only (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.91; P < 0.001; 7 studies; 8314 women; high-quality evidence with no heterogeneity). Bisphosphonates did not significantly reduce the incidence of fractures when compared to placebo/no bisphosphonates (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.08, P = 0.13, 6 studies, 7602 women; moderate-quality evidence due to wide confidence intervals). We await mature overall survival and disease-free survival results for denosumab trials. In women with ABC without clinically evident bone metastases, there was no evidence of an effect of bisphosphonates on bone metastases (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.43; P = 0.86; 3 studies; 330 women; moderate-quality evidence with no heterogeneity) or overall survival (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.09; P = 0.28; 3 studies; 330 women; high-quality evidence with no heterogeneity) compared to placebo/no bisphosphonates however the confidence intervals were wide. One study reported a trend towards an extended period of time without a SRE with bisphosphonate compared to placebo (low-quality evidence). One study reported quality of life and there was no apparent difference in scores between bisphosphonate and placebo (moderate-quality evidence). In women with BCBM, bisphosphonates reduced the SRE risk by 14% (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.95; P = 0.003; 9 studies; 2810 women; high-quality evidence with evidence of heterogeneity) compared with placebo/no bisphosphonates. This benefit persisted when administering either intravenous or oral bisphosphonates versus placebo. Bisphosphonates delayed the median time to a SRE with a median ratio of 1.43 (95% CI 1.29 to 1.58; P < 0.00001; 9 studies; 2891 women; high-quality evidence with no heterogeneity) and reduced bone pain (in 6 out of 11 studies; moderate-quality evidence) compared to placebo/no bisphosphonate. Treatment with bisphosphonates did not appear to affect overall survival (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.11; P = 0.85; 7 studies; 1935 women; moderate-quality evidence with significant heterogeneity). Quality-of-life scores were slightly better with bisphosphonates than placebo at comparable time points (in three out of five studies; moderate-quality evidence) however scores decreased during the course of the studies. Denosumab reduced the risk of developing a SRE compared with bisphosphonates by 22% (RR 0.78, 0.72 to 0.85; P < 0.001; 3 studies, 2345 women). One study reported data on overall survival and observed no difference in survival between denosumab and bisphosphonate. Reported toxicities across all settings were generally mild. Osteonecrosis of the jaw was rare, occurring less than 0.5% in the adjuvant setting (high-quality evidence).
For women with EBC, bisphosphonates reduce the risk of bone metastases and provide an overall survival benefit compared to placebo or no bisphosphonates. There is preliminary evidence suggestive that bisphosphonates provide an overall survival and disease-free survival benefit in postmenopausal women only when compared to placebo or no bisphosphonate. This was not a planned subgroup for these early trials, and we await the completion of new large clinical trials assessing benefit for postmenopausal women. For women with BCBM, bisphosphonates reduce the risk of developing SREs, delay the median time to an SRE, and appear to reduce bone pain compared to placebo or no bisphosphonate.","Breast cancer may spread and recur in the bones. This may cause fractures, pain and high calcium in the bloodstream (known as complications).
Medicines for osteoporosis may prevent these complications and may help cure cancer by reducing cancer growth in the bone. These medicines are called 'bisphosphonates'. A newer type is called  denosumab. Bisphosphonates or denosumab are given in addition to other cancer treatment medications. These may be given along with chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, or radiotherapy.
The goal of bisphosphonates and denosumab differs based on the women's breast cancer status.
We asked three main questions:
1. For women with early breast cancer (EBC) , can bisphosphonates or denosumab reduce the risk of the cancer spreading to the bone? Will adding this medicine to anticancer treatments allow women to live longer (improve survival)?
2. For women with advanced breast cancer which does not appear to involve the bone (ABC) , can bisphosphonates reduce the risk of the cancer spreading to the bone and improve survival? Will bisphosphonates reduce complications and improve quality of life?
3. For women with metastatic breast cancer that has spread to the bone (BCBM), can bisphosphonates or denosumab reduce the risk of complication, and improve quality of life and survival?
We found 44 studies involving 37,302 participants. We included studies published by September 2016.
For women with EBC, we included 17 studies with 26,129 participants. The women's health was monitored for at least 12 months from the start of the study. Some studies monitored women for 10 years.
The studies tested different types of bisphosphonate drugs and denosumab, and different doses of these drugs. Some studies compared the drugs to no treatment. Some studies used oral medications. Other studies gave the medicine as an injection into a vein or under the skin.
Bisphosphonates probably lowered the risk of cancer spreading to the bone.
Bisphosphonates were found to improve survival, but the benefit in the whole group of women was small. Postmenopausal women had a benefit from bisphosphonates with improved survival and reduced risk of cancer returning. Premenopausal women did not have improved survival or reduced risk of the cancer returning. New studies that test bisphosphonates by the women's menopausal status are awaited.
We await the reporting of data on survival and other important outcomes from denosumab trials.
For women with ABC that had not spread to the bone, we included three studies enrolling 330 participants. All three studies compared oral bisphosphonates to no treatment.
Bisphosphonates did not reduce the risk of cancer spreading to the bone or improve survival. Very little information was available on complications and quality of life from only one study.
For women with BCBM, we included 24 studies enrolling 10,853 participants. Their health was monitored for at least 12 months. Some women were followed for 24 months. Most studies compared bisphosphonates to receiving no medication.
Bisphosphonates reduced complications (fractures and bone pain). Bisphosphonates did not appear to increase the length of time women survived. Quality of life scores were slightly better for women receiving bisphosphonates compared to similar women having no bisphosphonates.
Denosumab reduced the risk of complications compared to bisphosphonates in the three studies that collected these data. There was no benefit in survival from denosumab in the one study that collected data.
Side effects were uncommon and mild. There was a rare risk of damage to the jaw bone (osteonecrosis of the jaw).

60c969c12749ced10866921d,interactive_4,Immunosuppressive treatment for focal segmental glomerulosclerosis in adults,"Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) can result from primary, genetic, or secondary causes; primary disease typically leads to nephrotic syndrome, while genetic and secondary forms may present with asymptomatic proteinuria or with nephrotic syndrome. Only about 20% of patients achieve partial or complete remission with treatment, and roughly half progress to kidney failure. This updated review assessed treatments for adults with FSGS and included 15 studies with 560 participants, all of whom had steroid-resistant disease since no trials evaluated corticosteroids versus placebo despite guidelines recommending steroids as first-line therapy. Five studies compared cyclosporin, with or without prednisone, to various treatments including no specific therapy, prednisone, methylprednisolone, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and dexamethasone. Other small single trials evaluated monoclonal antibodies such as adalimumab and fresolimumab, rituximab versus tacrolimus, cyclosporin plus valsartan versus cyclosporin alone, MMF versus prednisone, chlorambucil with steroids versus no treatment, different dexamethasone regimens, CCX140-B versus placebo, and one larger study compared sparsentan to irbesartan. Evidence for cyclosporin suggested it may increase the likelihood of complete remission and of combined complete or partial remission, though results were imprecise and based on few small trials. Cyclosporin showed little to no difference in preventing chronic kidney disease progression or kidney failure, and its effects on hypertension or infection remained uncertain. MMF appeared to offer little or no difference compared to prednisone for remission outcomes or kidney function, and most other interventions had very low certainty evidence, preventing firm conclusions. It is also uncertain whether sparsentan reduces proteinuria more effectively than irbesartan. Overall, no trials evaluated the recommended first-line therapy of corticosteroids, and the available evidence applies only to steroid-resistant FSGS. Cyclosporin may improve remission rates when given for at least six months, but confidence in these findings is limited by the small size and variability of the studies. Future trials must more clearly define patient populations distinguishing primary, genetic, and secondary FSGS to support stronger treatment recommendations.","Nephrotic syndrome is a condition where the kidneys leak protein from the blood into the urine. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) defined on kidney biopsy is an uncommon cause of nephrotic syndrome disease but it progresses to kidney failure in about half of all cases. It can be divided into three groups - primary FSGS (thought to be due to a factor circulating in the blood that damages the kidneys), genetic (secondary to mutations in one or more genes), and secondary to other causes, including certain infections. Treatments aim to reduce the amount of protein in the urine completely or partly to increase the time before kidney failure develops.
We looked at all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which examined therapy with prednisone or other agents which affect the immune system such as cyclosporin and mycophenolate mofetil and other agents with or without steroid therapy. We found 15 studies involving 553 participants. In five studies cyclosporin was compared with different treatments. Combining four studies (231 participants) showed that cyclosporin was more effective than these other treatments in achieving complete remission of nephrotic syndrome. The studies were too small and lasted for too short a time to determine if cyclosporin reduced the risk of kidney failure. Nine small studies examined different medicines that suppress the body's immune system. None of these treatments reduced the amount of protein in the urine.
We found limited information that cyclosporin may reduce the amount of protein in the urine in some people with FSGS but the data are uncertain because the studies enrolled too few participants.

60c969c12749ced10866921d,interactive_4,Which exercise is better for reducing fatigue caused by cancer: cardiovascular or resistance training?,"With prevalence estimates between 50% and 90% of people with cancer, cancer-related fatigue is one of the most common morbidities related to cancer and its treatment. Exercise is beneficial for the treatment of cancer-related fatigue. However, the efficacy of different types of exercise (i.e. cardiovascular training and resistance training) have not yet been investigated systematically and compared directly in a meta-analysis.
To compare the benefits and harms of cardiovascular training versus resistance training for treatment or prevention of cancer-related fatigue in people with cancer.
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and five other databases in January 2023. We searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials. We integrated results from update searches of previously published Cochrane reviews. In total, our searches included trials from inception to October 2023.
We included randomised controlled trials investigating cardiovascular training compared with resistance training, with exercise as the main component. We included studies on adults with cancer (aged 18 years and older), with or without a diagnosis of cancer-related fatigue, for any type of cancer and any type of cancer treatment, with the intervention starting before, during, or after treatment. We included trials evaluating at least one of our primary outcomes (cancer-related fatigue or quality of life). We excluded combined cardiovascular and resistance interventions, yoga, and mindfulness-based interventions. Our primary outcomes were cancer-related fatigue and quality of life. Our secondary outcomes were adverse events, anxiety, and depression.
We used standard Cochrane methodology. For analyses, we pooled results within the same period of outcome assessment (i.e. short term (up to and including 12 weeks' follow-up), medium term (more than 12 weeks' to less than six months' follow-up), and long term (six months' follow-up or longer)). We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane RoB 1 tool, and certainty of the evidence using GRADE.
We included six studies with 447 participants with prostate, breast, or lung cancer who received radiotherapy or chemotherapy, had surgery, or a combination of these. All studies had a high risk of bias due to lack of blinding. Three studies had an additional high risk of bias domain; one study for attrition bias, and two studies for selection bias. Interventions in the cardiovascular training groups included training on a cycle ergometer, treadmill, an elliptical trainer, or indoor bike. Interventions in the resistance training group included a varying number of exercises using bodyweight, weights, or resistance bands. Interventions varied in frequency, intensity, and duration. None of the included studies reported including participants with a confirmed cancer-related fatigue diagnosis. The interventions in four studies started during cancer treatment and in two studies after cancer treatment. Before treatment No studies reported interventions starting before cancer treatment. During treatment the evidence was very uncertain about the effect of cardiovascular training compared with resistance training for short-term cancer-related fatigue (mean difference (MD)-0.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.52 to 1.84; 4 studies, 311 participants; Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue) scale where higher values indicate better outcome; very low-certainty evidence) and long-term cancer-related fatigue (MD 1.30, 95% CI: 2.17 to 4.77; 1 study, 141 participants; FACIT-Fatigue scale; very low-certainty evidence). The evidence was very uncertain about the effect of cardiovascular training compared with resistance training for short-term quality of life (MD 1.47, 95% CI -1.47 to 4.42; 4 studies, 319 participants; Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy General scale where higher values indicate better outcome; very low-certainty evidence) and for long-term quality of life (MD 3.40, 95% CI -4.85 to 11.65; 1 study, 141 participants; Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Anemia scale where higher values indicate better outcome; very low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of cardiovascular training compared with resistance training on the occurrence of adverse events at any follow-up (risk ratio (RR) 2.00, 95% CI 0.19 to 21.18; 2 studies, 128 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No studies reported medium-term cancer-related fatigue or quality of life. After treatment, the evidence was very uncertain about the effect of cardiovascular training compared with resistance training for short-term cancer-related fatigue (MD 1.47, 95% CI -0.09 to 3.03; 1 study, 95 participants; Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory 20 General Fatigue subscale where higher values indicate worse outcome; very low-certainty evidence). Resistance training may improve short-term quality of life compared to cardiovascular training, but the evidence is very uncertain (MD -10.96, 95% CI -17.77 to -4.15; 1 study, 95 participants; European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30 Global Health subscale where higher values indicate better outcome; very low-certainty evidence). No studies reported outcomes at medium-term or long-term follow-up. Overall, the evidence is very uncertain about the effects of cardiovascular training compared with resistance training on treatment of cancer-related fatigue in people with cancer. Larger, well-conducted studies including people with different cancer types receiving different treatments are needed to increase the certainty in the evidence and to better understand who may benefit most from cardiovascular or resistance training. Moreover, studies comparing the effects of cardiovascular and resistance training initiated before as well as after cancer treatment are needed to understand the prophylactic and rehabilitative effects of these exercise types on cancer-related fatigue.","Fatigue caused by cancer is a feeling of extreme tiredness that lasts for a long time. It is related to cancer or cancer treatment, or both. It affects both the body and feelings, and can make it difficult to do regular activities. Fatigue caused by cancer is a lot worse than regular tiredness, and it does not go away with more sleep or rest.
We wanted to find out if there are differences between cardiovascular training and resistance training for the treatment and prevention of fatigue caused by cancer, well-being (also known as quality of life), and unwanted effects. Cardiovascular training involves exercise such as walking, running, swimming, and cycling, whereas resistance training includes exercise using one's own bodyweight, weights, or elastic therapy bands.
We searched for studies that compared cardiovascular training and resistance training in people with any type of cancer. Training could have been started before, during, or after cancer treatment.
We summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.
We found six studies that involved 447 people with breast cancer, prostate cancer (a small gland in the pelvis that is part of the male reproductive system), or lung cancer. These studies did not report if people already had fatigue caused by cancer before starting to exercise. People in these studies were treated with chemotherapy (medicines to kill the cancer), radiotherapy (radiation directed at the cancer to reduce or kill it), surgery (to remove the cancer), or a combination of these. The cardiovascular or resistance training started during or after cancer treatment. Most studies looked at short-term results (up to and including 12 weeks of monitoring), only one study had long-term results (six months or longer of monitoring). Studies were supported by research grants and took place in Canada, Belgium, the USA, and Germany.
The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of cardiovascular and resistance training on fatigue caused by cancer, well-being, and unwanted effects in the short or long term.
Our confidence in the evidence is very low. We found only a few studies including low numbers of people. We also found problems in the methods of the studies. For example, people in the studies knew which training they received.

60c969c12749ced10866921d,finetuned_5,Mucolytic agents for chronic bronchitis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,"Individuals with chronic bronchitis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) often experience recurrent exacerbations involving increased sputum volume or purulence. These exacerbations carry substantial personal and healthcare burdens, so therapies that reduce their occurrence may be useful. Mucolytics are oral medications intended to reduce the viscosity of sputum, making it easier to cough up, which may decrease the frequency of COPD exacerbations. This review evaluated whether mucolytics reduce exacerbations or days of disability, whether they improve lung function or quality of life, and whether they cause adverse effects. We searched major databases through 23 April 2019 and included randomized studies comparing oral mucolytics with placebo for at least two months in adults with chronic bronchitis or COPD, excluding people with asthma or cystic fibrosis. This update added four new studies, bringing the total to 38 trials with 10,377 participants, lasting from two months to three years, and covering various mucolytics such as N-acetylcysteine, carbocysteine, erdosteine, and ambroxol. Many studies had unclear allocation concealment, possible issues with blinding, and high attrition rates. Results from 28 studies with 6723 participants showed that people receiving mucolytics were more likely to remain free of exacerbations during the study period compared with placebo (Peto OR 1.73), although more recent studies showed smaller benefits than earlier ones. The number needed to treat for an average of nine months to keep one additional person free from exacerbations was eight. High heterogeneity suggests caution in interpretation, and effects did not vary meaningfully by mucolytic type, dose, COPD severity, or exacerbation history. Longer studies reported smaller treatment effects. Mucolytics reduced days of disability by 0.43 days per month compared with placebo, and they may reduce hospitalisations, although evidence was inconsistent. Some improvement in quality of life was reported, but it did not reach the threshold for clinical importance. Mucolytics were associated with a possible reduction in adverse events, though some excluded studies reported high rates of adverse events. There was no clear difference between mucolytics and placebo with respect to mortality, although estimates were imprecise. Overall, mucolytics appear to modestly reduce exacerbations, days of disability, and possibly hospitalisations without increasing adverse events, but they have little effect on lung function or health-related quality of life. High heterogeneity and larger effects in older studies reduce confidence in the findings, and true benefits may be smaller than earlier evidence suggested.","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and chronic bronchitis are long-term breathing conditions. They cause symptoms such as shortness of breath, cough, and excess sputum. People with COPD and chronic bronchitis may have flare-ups (exacerbations) when their symptoms become worse. Mucolytics are medicines taken orally that may loosen sputum, making it easier to cough it up. Mucolytics may have other beneficial effects on lung infection and inflammation and may reduce the number of flare-ups that people with COPD and chronic bronchitis have. Mucolytics can also be inhaled, but we did not look at inhaled mucolytics in this review.
We looked for studies lasting at least two months, in which it was decided at random whether a person received a mucolytic drug or a placebo. We did not include studies involving children or people with other breathing conditions such as asthma and cystic fibrosis. We found 38 studies to include in our review. These studies included a total of 10,377 adults with COPD or chronic bronchitis. The studies used a variety of mucolytic drugs, including N-acetylcysteine, carbocysteine, and erdosteine and lasted from two months to three years. Mucolytics were taken by mouth between one and three times per day. These studies measured several different outcomes to find out if the drug was useful, including flare-ups, hospital admissions, quality of life, lung function, and side effects. We are moderately confident about the results we have presented. Our confidence is reduced by the results from individual studies looking quite different from one another and the mix of older and newer studies that we found. Also, in some cases there were not enough data to be sure whether mucolytics were better or worse than, or the same as, placebo. Mucolytics appear to be useful for reducing flare-ups, days of disability, and hospital admissions in people with COPD or chronic bronchitis, and they do not appear to cause more side effects. However, they do not appear to have much impact on quality of life or lung function, and we could not be sure about their impact on death.",1077,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
60c969c12749ced10866921d,finetuned_6,Cannabis-based medicines for cancer pain,"Pain is a common symptom in people with cancer; 30% to 50% of people with cancer will experience moderate-to-severe pain. This can have a major negative impact on their quality of life. Opioid (morphine-like) medications are commonly used to treat moderate or severe cancer pain, and are recommended for this purpose in the World Health Organization (WHO) pain treatment ladder. Pain is not sufficiently relieved by opioid medications in 10% to 15% of people with cancer. In people with insufficient relief of cancer pain, new analgesics are needed to effectively and safely supplement or replace opioids. To evaluate the benefits and harms of cannabis-based medicines, including medical cannabis, for treating pain and other symptoms in adults with cancer compared to placebo or any other established analgesic for cancer pain. We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 26 January 2023. We selected double-blind randomised, controlled trials (RCT) of medical cannabis, plant-derived and synthetic cannabis-based medicines against placebo or any other active treatment for cancer pain in adults, with any treatment duration and at least 10 participants per treatment arm. We used standard Cochrane methods. The primary outcomes were 1. proportions of participants reporting no worse than mild pain; 2. Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) of much improved or very much improved and 3. withdrawals due to adverse events. Secondary outcomes were 4. number of participants who reported pain relief of 30% or greater and overall opioid use reduced or stable; 5. number of participants who reported pain relief of 30% or greater, or 50% or greater; 6. pain intensity; 7. sleep problems; 8. depression and anxiety; 9. daily maintenance and breakthrough opioid dosage; 10. dropouts due to lack of efficacy; 11. all central nervous system adverse events. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence for each outcome. We identified 14 studies involving 1823 participants. No study assessed the proportions of participants reporting no worse than mild pain on treatment by 14 days after start of treatment. We found five RCTs assessing oromucosal nabiximols (tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD)) or THC alone involving 1539 participants with moderate or severe pain despite opioid therapy. The double-blind periods of the RCTs ranged between two and five weeks. Four studies with a parallel design and 1333 participants were available for meta-analysis. There was moderate-certainty evidence that there was no clinically relevant benefit for proportions of PGIC much or very much improved (risk difference (RD) 0.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 0.12; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 16, 95% CI 8 to 100). There was moderate-certainty evidence for no clinically relevant difference in the proportion of withdrawals due to adverse events (RD 0.04, 95% CI 0 to 0.08; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 25, 95% CI 16 to endless). There was moderate-certainty evidence for no difference between nabiximols or THC and placebo in the frequency of serious adverse events (RD 0.02, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.07). There was moderate-certainty evidence that nabiximols and THC used as add-on treatment for opioid-refractory cancer pain did not differ from placebo in reducing mean pain intensity (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.19, 95% CI -0.40 to 0.02). There was low-certainty evidence that a synthetic THC analogue (nabilone) delivered over eight weeks was not superior to placebo in reducing pain associated with chemotherapy or radiochemotherapy in people with head and neck cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (2 studies, 89 participants, qualitative analysis). Analyses of tolerability and safety were not possible for these studies. There was low-certainty evidence that synthetic THC analogues were superior to placebo (SMD -0.98, 95% CI -1.36 to -0.60), but not superior to low-dose codeine (SMD 0.03, 95% CI -0.25 to 0.32; 5 single-dose trials; 126 participants) in reducing moderate-to-severe cancer pain after cessation of previous analgesic treatment for three to four and a half hours (2 single-dose trials; 66 participants). Analyses of tolerability and safety were not possible for these studies. There was low-certainty evidence that CBD oil did not add value to specialist palliative care alone in the reduction of pain intensity in people with advanced cancer. There was no difference in the number of dropouts due to adverse events and serious adverse events (1 study, 144 participants, qualitative analysis). We found no studies using herbal cannabis. There is moderate-certainty evidence that oromucosal nabiximols and THC are ineffective in relieving moderate-to-severe opioid-refractory cancer pain. There is low-certainty evidence that nabilone is ineffective in reducing pain associated with (radio-) chemotherapy in people with head and neck cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. There is low-certainty evidence that a single dose of synthetic THC analogues is not superior to a single low-dose morphine equivalent in reducing moderate-to-severe cancer pain. There is low-certainty evidence that CBD does not add value to specialist palliative care alone in the reduction of pain in people with advanced cancer.","One person in two or three who gets cancer will have pain that becomes moderate or severe in intensity. The pain tends to get worse as the cancer progresses.
The WHO recommends taking morphine-like medicines for moderate-to-severe pain from cancer, but 1 in 6 to 10 people with cancer pain do not experience sufficient pain relief from morphine-like medicines. Several products based on the cannabis plant have been suggested as treatment for cancer pain. These products include inhaled or orally ingested herbal cannabis, and various oils, sprays or tablets containing active cannabis ingredients obtained from the plant, or made synthetically. Some people with cancer pain have reported that CbMs are effective for them, and that is often highlighted in the media.
If CbMs relieved cancer pain in people living with cancer.
If CbMs were associated with any unwanted or harmful effects.
We searched for clinical trials that examined CbMs compared to other medications to treat cancer pain in adults.
We summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as the methods and size of studies.
We found 14 studies involving 1823 people. The biggest study included 399 people and the smallest study included 10 people.
Studies were conducted in countries around the world; most (six) were based in North America.
Five studies used one dose of CbM and lasted less than one day. Other studies lasted between two and eight weeks.
Pharmaceutical companies funded seven studies.
Six studies compared a mouth spray with a plant-derived combination of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the principal psychoactive constituent of cannabis, and cannabidiol (CBD), an anti-inflammatory ingredient of cannabis, against a fake medication (placebo). Seven studies compared an artificial cannabinoid mimicking the effects of THC against placebo. Of these seven studies, two studies compared against a morphine-like medication (codeine), too. One study compared CBD against placebo.
We did not find studies with herbal cannabis.
Mouth spray with a plant-derived combination of THC and CBD was probably not better than placebo in reducing pain in people with moderate-to-severe cancer pain despite opioid treatment. Thirty-two out of 100 people reported to be much or very much improved by cannabis-based mouth spray and 23 out of 100 people with mouth spray with placebo. A total of 19 out of 100 people withdrew early because of side effects by cannabis-based mouth spray and 16 out of 100 people by mouth spray with placebo. There was no difference in serious side effects between the cannabis-based mouth spray and a placebo mouth spray.
Artificial cannabinoid mimicking the effects of THC may not be better than a fake medication in reducing pain associated with chemotherapy or radiochemotherapy in people with head and neck cancer and a certain type of lung cancer.
A single dose of an artificial cannabinoid mimicking the effects of THC may be better than a single dose of placebo, but may not differ from a single small dose of a morphine-like medication in reducing moderate-to-severe cancer pain after cessation of previous analgesic treatment for three to four and a half hours.
CBD may not add value to specialist palliative care alone in the reduction of pain in people with advanced cancer.
We found no studies with medical cannabis.
We are moderately confident in the evidence that a mouth spray with a plant-derived combination of THC and CBD does not reduce severe cancer pain despite opioid treatment because studies did not provide information about everything that we could have used.
We have little confidence in the evidence that an artificial cannabinoid mimicking the effects of THC (nabilone) does not reduce pain associated with chemotherapy or radiochemotherapy because the studies did not provide data about everything that we could have used, and because the studies were small.
We have little confidence in the evidence that artificial cannabinoids mimicking the effects of THC reduce cancer pain after the previous pain-relieving medication was stopped some hours before because the studies did not provide data about everything that we could have used, and because the studies were small.
We have little confidence in the evidence that CBD added to standard palliative care does not reduce cancer pain because there was only one study available.",1016,Opioid-refractory; oromucosal nabiximols; tetrahydrocannabinol (THC); cannabidiol (CBD); patient global impression of change (PGIC); synthetic THC analogue; analgesic treatment; chemotherapy; radiochemotherapy; adverse events,How do the study results challenge the potential use of cannabis-based medicines as alternatives to opioids for cancer pain?,What was a key motivation for the study?,Select all of the following that are colors,What was the outcome of using a mouth spray with THC and CBD for cancer pain?,"In the study, how did artificial cannabinoids perform compared to codeine?",There is no strong evidence that CbMs offer superior pain relief to opioids.; CbMs consistently showed better results than placebo.; CbMs treatments are associated with fewer side effects than opioids.,There is no strong evidence that CbMs offer superior pain relief to opioids.,To determine the effectiveness of CbMs in cancer pain relief.; To find new synthetic drugs for cancer treatment.; To evaluate the cost of cancer treatments.,To determine the effectiveness of CbMs in cancer pain relief.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,It was more effective than placebo.; It did not show significant improvement over placebo.; It cured the pain completely.,It did not show significant improvement over placebo.,They were superior in reducing pain.; They showed no difference in pain reduction.; They were less effective than codeine.,They showed no difference in pain reduction.
60c969c12749ced10866921d,finetuned_6,Treatments to reduce body temperature to 35C in people who are in hospital after a traumatic brain injury,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and disability, with an estimated 5.5 million people experiencing severe TBI worldwide every year. Observational clinical studies suggest a link between raised body temperature and unfavourable outcomes, though findings are inconsistent. Preclinical models indicate that reducing temperature to 35C to 37.5C may improve biological outcomes compared to deeper cooling (33C). It remains unknown whether reducing body temperature to 35C in people admitted to hospital with TBI is beneficial, neutral, or harmful. This review updates a previous version published in 2014. We aimed to assess the effects of pharmacological or physical interventions designed to reduce body temperature to 35C in adults and children hospitalised after TBI. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, PubMed, clinical trial registers, grey literature, reference lists, and forward citations up to 28 November 2019. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving participants of any age admitted after TBI and receiving interventions intended to lower body temperature within the target range, including medications (paracetamol, NSAIDs) or physical cooling methods (surface cooling devices, bedside fans, cooled intravenous fluids). Eligible comparators were placebo or usual care. Two authors independently assessed studies, extracted data, and evaluated risk of bias, using GRADE to assess certainty of evidence. Only one RCT with 41 adult participants, conducted in two Australian intensive care units, met the criteria. Participants received intravenous paracetamol (1 g every four hours for 72 hours) or a matched placebo. We were uncertain whether paracetamol influenced 28-day mortality (risk ratio 2.86, 95% CI 0.32 to 25.24). The certainty of evidence was very low due to imprecision (small sample size) and selective reporting concerns, although other risks of bias were low. The study did not report the primary outcome of poor outcome at follow-up (death or dependency) or any secondary outcomes of interest, including intracranial or extracranial haemorrhage, abnormal intracranial pressure, or pneumonia or other serious infections. We found one additional completed trial of a physical intervention (advanced fever control using a surface cooling device versus standard fever control in 12 participants), but it was published only as an abstract with insufficient details for inclusion; it is listed as awaiting classification pending further information. Four ongoing trials may contribute data to future updates if they report relevant outcomes and provide separate results for participants with TBI when mixed populations are included. In conclusion, one small study contributed very low-certainty evidence on mortality. Overall uncertainty is driven by extremely limited research on interventions aimed at reducing body temperature to 35C after TBI. More research evaluating both pharmacological and physical interventions is needed. Future studies should include outcomes important to patients, such as side effects (e.g., nausea, vomiting) and discomfort caused by cooling therapies.","Traumatic brain injury occurs when direct force to the headsuch as from a road traffic accident or a fall causes damage to the brain. It is a major global health problem, affecting about 5.5 million people each year. Injury occurs in two stages: first at the moment of impact, and then over the following hours to weeks as secondary damage develops. Treatment aims to limit this secondary damage. Some evidence suggests that people with normal body temperature after injury may have better outcomes than those with elevated temperatures. This review examined whether medicines or non-drug physical cooling methods that reduce body temperature to between 35C improve outcomes for adults or children hospitalized after traumatic brain injury. We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs)the most reliable type of evidence up to 28 November 2019. Only one small RCT with 41 participants was found. It compared intravenous paracetamol, given for 72 hours, with an intravenous salt solution made to look identical. No published trials assessed other medicines or physical cooling methods such as cooling blankets, ice, fans, or cooled fluids. One very small study of physical cooling was identified but lacked enough information for inclusion, and four ongoing studies may provide future evidence. Some of these include mixed types of brain injury, and we will only be able to use them if they report traumatic brain injury results separately. We were uncertain whether paracetamol reduced deaths within 28 days because the study was very small and did not originally plan to report mortality. It also did not report any of our key outcomes, such as poor functional outcome (death or dependency), serious bleeding inside or outside the brain, raised intracranial pressure, pneumonia, or other infections. Although the study methods were generally sound, the lack of pre-specified reporting increased the risk of bias. With only one small study, the certainty of the evidence was very low, meaning the true effects may be very different from what was reported. Overall, we remain uncertain whether medicines or physical cooling treatments that lower body temperature to 35C benefit people in hospital after traumatic brain injury. More and larger studies are needed, and future updates will assess side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and discomfort, which we hope ongoing and future research will report.",1056,Traumatic brain injury; pharmacological interventions; physical cooling methods; certainty of evidence; imprecision; intracranial pressure; extracranial haemorrhage; pneumonia; advanced fever control,What were the motivations for the study's focus on cooling treatments for TBI?,Which factors contributed to the uncertainty of the study results on paracetamol?,Select all of the following that are colors,"Based on the study, what can be concluded about the use of cooling methods in reducing TBI mortality rates?",Explain the main goal of the study in your own words.,Elevated body temperatures suggest potentially worse outcomes for TBI patients.; Normal body temperature is universally accepted to improve brain injury outcomes.; Cooling treatments have been consistently proven in other unrelated medical contexts.,Elevated body temperatures suggest potentially worse outcomes for TBI patients.,The study used a too short duration of treatment.; The small sample size and lack of pre-planned mortality reporting.; The study confirmed that all key outcomes were reported comprehensively.,The small sample size and lack of pre-planned mortality reporting.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,The study provides strong evidence that cooling methods reduce mortality.; Cooling methods' impact on mortality is uncertain due to the study's limited scope.; Mortality rates increase significantly with the use of cooling methods.,Cooling methods' impact on mortality is uncertain due to the study's limited scope.,To determine if cooling to 35-37.5Â°C improves outcomes after TBI; To establish the best surgical intervention for TBI; To identify genetic markers of TBI,To determine if cooling to 35-37.5Â°C improves outcomes after TBI
56259489ed6e5a0005c80fde,static_1,Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors for prevention or delay of type 2 diabetes and associated complications in people at increased risk of type 2 diabetes,"Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (AGI) reduce blood glucose levels and may thus prevent or delay type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its associated complications in people at risk of developing of T2DM.
To assess the effects of AGI in people with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), impaired fasting blood glucose (IFG), moderately elevated glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) or any combination of these.
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and the reference lists of systematic reviews, articles and health technology assessment reports. The date of the last search of all databases was December 2017.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), with a duration of one year or more, comparing AGI with any pharmacological glucose-lowering intervention, behaviour-changing intervention, placebo or no intervention in people with IFG, IGT, moderately elevated HbA1c or combinations of these.
Two review authors read all abstracts and full-text articles or records, assessed quality and extracted outcome data independently. One review author extracted data, which were checked by a second review author. We resolved discrepancies by consensus or involvement of a third review author. For meta-analyses we used a random-effects model with assessment of risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes, using 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for effect estimates. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence by using the GRADE instrument.
For this update of the Cochrane Review (first published 2006, Issue 4) we included 10 RCTs (11,814 participants), eight investigating acarbose and two investigating voglibose, that included people with IGT or people ""at increased risk for diabetes"". The trial duration ranged from one to six years. Most trials compared AGI with placebo (N = 4) or no intervention (N = 4). Acarbose reduced the incidence of T2DM compared to placebo: 670 out of 4014 people (16.7%) in the acarbose groups developed T2DM, compared to 812 out of 3994 people (20.3%) in the placebo groups (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.89; P < 0.0001; 3 trials; 8008 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). One trial including participants with coronary heart disease and IGT contributed 64% of cases for this outcome. Acarbose reduced the risk of T2DM compared to no intervention: 7 out 75 people (9.3%) in the acarbose groups developed T2DM, compared to 18 out of 65 people (27.7%) in the no-intervention groups (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.69; P = 0.004; 2 trials; 140 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Acarbose compared to placebo did not reduce or increase the risk of all-cause mortality (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.18; P = 0.86; 3 trials; 8069 participants; very low-certainty evidence), cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.71 to 1.10; P = 0.26; 3 trials; 8069 participants; very low-certainty evidence), serious adverse events (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.29; P = 0.13; 2 trials; 6625 participants; low-certainty evidence), non-fatal stroke (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.74; P = 0.43; 1 trial; 1368 participants; very low-certainty evidence) or congestive heart failure (RR of 0.87; 95% CI 0.63 to 1.12; P = 0.40; 2 trials; 7890 participants; low-certainty evidence). Acarbose compared to placebo reduced non-fatal myocardial infarction: one out of 742 participants (0.1%) in the acarbose groups had a non-fatal myocardial infarction compared to 15 out of 744 participants (2%) in the placebo groups (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.53; P = 0.007; 2 trials; 1486 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Acarbose treatment showed an increased risk of non-serious adverse events (mainly gastro-intestinal events), compared to placebo: 751 of 775 people (96.9%) in the acarbose groups experienced an event, compared to 723 of 775 people (93.3%) in the placebo groups (RR 1.04; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.06; P = 0.0008; 2 trials; 1550 participants). Acarbose compared to no intervention showed no advantage or disadvantage for any of these outcome measures (very low-certainty evidence). One trial each compared voglibose with placebo (1780 participants) or diet and exercise (870 participants). Voglibose compared to placebo reduced the incidence of T2DM: 50 out of 897 participants (5.6%) developed T2DM, compared to 106 out of 881 participants (12%) in the placebo group (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.64; P < 0.0001; 1 trial; 1778 participants; low-certainty evidence). For all other reported outcome measures there were no clear differences between voglibose and comparator groups. One trial with 90 participants compared acarbose with diet and exercise and another trial with 98 participants reported data on acarbose versus metformin. There were no clear differences for any outcome measure between these two acarbose interventions and the associated comparator groups. None of the trials reported amputation of lower extremity, blindness or severe vision loss, end-stage renal disease, health-related quality of life, time to progression to T2DM, or socioeconomic effects.
AGI may prevent or delay the development of T2DM in people with IGT. There is no firm evidence that AGI have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular mortality or cardiovascular events.","People with moderately elevated glucose levels are often said to be at an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Therefore, these people are frequently recommended to increase exercise and lower calorie intake to prevent type 2 diabetes. Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (acarbose, miglitol, voglibose) are used to lower blood glucose in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is currently not known whether alpha-glucosidase inhibitors should be prescribed for people with moderately raised blood glucose levels. We wanted to find out whether alpha-glucosidase inhibitors could prevent or delay type 2 diabetes mellitus in people with moderately elevated glucose levels. We searched medical literature for randomised controlled trials of at least one year's duration investigating alpha-glucosidase inhibitors in participants with glucose levels higher than considered normal but below the diagnostic criteria for type 2 diabetes mellitus. We found 10 randomised controlled trials representing 11,814 participants: eight investigating acarbose and two investigating voglibose. The trial duration ranged from one to six years. When comparing acarbose with placebo, 670 out of 4014 participants (17%) receiving acarbose developed type 2 diabetes compared to 812 out of 3994 participants (20%) receiving placebo. Most data for this comparison came from a trial including people with heart disease. When comparing acarbose with no intervention, seven out of 75 participants (9%) receiving acarbose developed type 2 diabetes compared to 18 out of 65 participants (28%) receiving no intervention. Acarbose treatment did not reduce or increase the risk of death from any cause, death from heart disease, serious side effects, strokes or heart failure. Compared to placebo, acarbose reduced the risk for heart attacks: one out of 742 participants (0.1%) receiving acarbose had a heart attack compared to 15 out of 744 participants (2%) receiving placebo. Acarbose treatment showed an increased risk of non-serious side effects (mainly gastrointestinal events): 751 of 775 people (97%) receiving acarbose had a non-serious side effect compared to 723 of 775 people (93%) receiving placebo. One trial compared voglibose with placebo and another compared voglibose with diet and exercise. When comparing voglibose with placebo, 50 out of 897 participants (5.6%) receiving voglibose developed type 2 diabetes compared to 106 out of 881 participants (12%) receiving placebo. One trial with 90 participants compared acarbose with diet and exercise and another with 98 participants compared acarbose with metformin; there were no important differences for any outcome. None of the trials reported amputation of lower limbs, blindness or severe vision loss, kidney disease, health-related quality of life, time to progression to type 2 diabetes mellitus, or socioeconomic effects such as absence from work or costs. For most of our outcomes we are uncertain or very uncertain how valid the results are. Reasons for this uncertainty include systematic errors in some trials, the low number of trials for several outcomes, imprecise results, and missing data from one included trial.",1012,Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors; type 2 diabetes mellitus; impaired glucose tolerance; impaired fasting blood glucose; glycosylated haemoglobin A1c; acarbose; voglibose; all-cause mortality; non-fatal myocardial infarction; non-serious adverse events,What is the primary goal of using alpha-glucosidase inhibitors in people with moderately elevated glucose levels?,Which alpha-glucosidase inhibitors were investigated in the study?,Select all of the following that are colors,How many randomised controlled trials were included in the study?,Which group showed a lower incidence of type 2 diabetes when comparing acarbose with placebo?,To prevent or delay type 2 diabetes mellitus; To increase physical exercise levels; To reduce calorie intake,To prevent or delay type 2 diabetes mellitus,Acarbose and voglibose; Metformin and voglibose; Miglitol and acarbose,Acarbose and voglibose,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,10 trials; 6 trials; 12 trials,10 trials,Acarbose group; Placebo group; Control group,Acarbose group
56259489ed6e5a0005c80fde,static_2,Interventions to prevent or reduce kidney complications in people with sickle cell disease,"Sickle cell disease (SCD), one of the commonest severe monogenic disorders, is caused by the inheritance of two abnormal haemoglobin (beta-globin) genes. SCD can cause severe pain, significant end-organ damage, pulmonary complications, and premature death. Kidney disease is a frequent and potentially severe complication in people with SCD. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined as abnormalities of kidney structure or function present for more than three months. Sickle cell nephropathy refers to the spectrum of kidney complications in SCD. Glomerular damage is a cause of microalbuminuria and can develop at an early age in children with SCD, with increased prevalence in adulthood. In people with sickle cell nephropathy, outcomes are poor as a result of the progression to proteinuria and chronic kidney insufficiency. Up to 12% of people who develop sickle cell nephropathy will develop end-stage renal disease. This is an update of a review first published in 2017. To assess the effectiveness of any intervention for preventing or reducing kidney complications or chronic kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease. Possible interventions include red blood cell transfusions, hydroxyurea, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), either alone or in combination. We searched for relevant trials in the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, seven other databases, and two other trials registers. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing interventions to prevent or reduce kidney complications or CKD in people with SCD. We applied no restrictions related to outcomes examined, language, or publication status. Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility, extracted data, assessed the risk of bias, and assessed the certainty of the evidence (GRADE). We included three RCTs with 385 participants. We rated the certainty of the evidence as low to very low across different outcomes according to GRADE methodology, downgrading for risk of bias concerns, indirectness, and imprecision. Hydroxyurea versus placebo One RCT published in 2011 compared hydroxyurea to placebo in 193 children aged nine to 18 months. We are unsure if hydroxyurea compared to placebo reduces or prevents progression of kidney disease assessed by change in glomerular filtration rate (mean difference (MD) 0.58 mL/min /1.73 m2, 95% confidence interval (CI) -14.60 to 15.76; 142 participants; very low certainty). Hydroxyurea compared to placebo may improve the ability to concentrate urine (MD 42.23 mOsm/kg, 95% CI 12.14 to 72.32; 178 participants; low certainty), and may make little or no difference to SCD-related serious adverse events, including acute chest syndrome (risk ratio (RR) 0.39, 99% CI 0.13 to 1.16; 193 participants; low certainty), painful crisis (RR 0.68, 99% CI 0.45 to 1.02; 193 participants; low certainty); and hospitalisations (RR 0.83, 99% CI 0.68 to 1.01; 193 participants; low certainty). No deaths occurred in either trial arm and the RCT did not report quality of life. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors versus placebo One RCT published in 1998 compared an ACEI (captopril) to placebo in 22 adults with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. We are unsure if captopril compared to placebo reduces proteinuria (MD -124.10 to 26.10; 22 participants; very low certainty). We are unsure if captopril reduces or prevents kidney disease as measured by creatinine clearance; the trial authors stated that creatinine clearance remained constant over six months in both groups, but provided no comparative data (very low certainty). The RCT did not report serious adverse events, all-cause mortality, or quality of life. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors versus vitamin C One RCT published in 2020 compared an ACEI (lisinopril)with vitamin C in 170 children aged one to 18 years with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. It reported no data we could analyse. We are unsure if lisinopril compared to vitamin C reduces proteinuria in this population: the large drop in microalbuminuria in both arms of the trial after only one month on treatment may have been due to an overestimation of microalbuminuria at baseline rather than a true effect. The RCT did not report serious adverse events, all-cause mortality, or quality of life. We are unsure if hydroxyurea improves glomerular filtration rate or reduces hyperfiltration in children aged nine to 18 months, but it may improve their ability to concentrate urine and may make little or no difference to the incidence of acute chest syndrome, painful crises, and hospitalisations. We are unsure if ACEI compared to placebo has any effect on preventing or reducing kidney complications in adults with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. We are unsure if ACEI compared to vitamin C has any effect on preventing or reducing kidney complications in children with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. No RCTs assessed red blood cell transfusions or any combined interventions to prevent or reduce kidney complications. Due to lack of evidence, we cannot comment on the management of children aged over 18 months or adults with any known genotype of SCD. We have identified a lack of adequately designed and powered studies, although we found four ongoing trials since the last version of this review. Only one ongoing trial addresses renal function as a primary outcome in the short term, but such interventions have long-term effects. Trials of hydroxyurea, ACEIs or red blood cell transfusion in older children and adults are urgently needed to determine any effect on prevention or reduction of kidney complications in people with SCD.","SCD is a serious inherited blood disorder where the red blood cells, which carry oxygen around the body, develop abnormally. Normal red blood cells are flexible and disc-shaped, but sickled cells are rigid and crescent-shaped, and stickier than normal red blood cells. This can lead to blockage of blood vessels, resulting in tissue and organ damage and episodes of severe pain. The abnormal cells are fragile and break apart easily, which leads to a decreased number of red blood cells, known as anaemia.Kidney complications can start at an early age in children with SCD and are common in adults with the condition. Kidney complications leading to kidney protein leak and chronic kidney disease can be severe, with serious effects on health. Severe complications include the need for dialysis (a procedure to remove waste products and excess fluid from the blood when the kidneys stop working properly) or a kidney transplant. Identifying therapies that can prevent or slow down the decline in kidney function in people with SCD is critical for improving health outcomes. The evidence is current to 22 September 2022. We found three randomised controlled trials, which enroled a total of 385 people. One trial, published in 2011, compared the drug hydroxyurea (which helps to maintain the shape and flexibility of red blood cells), to placebo (dummy treatment) in 193 children aged nine to 18 months. The second trial, published in 1998, compared captopril (a drug used to treat high blood pressure) to placebo in 22 adults with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria (high levels of protein in the urine).

56259489ed6e5a0005c80fde,static_2,Benefits and harms of antibiotics for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease,"Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of mortality worldwide with approximately 7.4 million deaths each year. People with established coronary heart disease have a high risk of subsequent cardiovascular events including myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death. Antibiotics might prevent such outcomes due to their antibacterial, antiinflammatory, and antioxidative effects. However, a randomised clinical trial and several observational studies have suggested that antibiotics may increase the risk of cardiovascular events and mortality. Furthermore, several non-Cochrane Reviews, that are now outdated, have assessed the effects of antibiotics for coronary heart disease and have shown conflicting results. No previous systematic review using Cochrane methodology has assessed the effects of antibiotics for coronary heart disease. We assessed the benefits and harms of antibiotics compared with placebo or no intervention for the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, SCI-EXPANDED, and BIOSIS in December 2019 in order to identify relevant trials. Additionally, we searched TRIP, Google Scholar, and nine trial registries in December 2019. We also contacted 11 pharmaceutical companies and searched the reference lists of included trials, previous systematic reviews, and other types of reviews. Randomised clinical trials assessing the effects of antibiotics versus placebo or no intervention for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease in adult participants (?18 years) were included irrespective of setting, blinding, publication status, publication year, language, and reporting of outcomes. Three review authors independently extracted data. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, serious adverse event according to ICH-GCP, and quality of life. Secondary outcomes were cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, and sudden cardiac death. The primary time point of interest was at maximum follow-up, and data were also extracted at 24±6 months follow-up. Risks of systematic errors were assessed using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool, and risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated. We included 38 trials randomising 26,638 participants (mean age 61.6 years), with 23/38 trials reporting data on 26,078 participants suitable for meta-analysis. Three trials were at low risk of bias and the remaining 35 were at high risk of bias. Trials assessing macrolides (28 trials; 22,059 participants) and quinolones (two trials; 4162 participants) contributed most of the data. Meta-analyses at maximum follow-up showed that antibiotics versus placebo or no intervention seemed to increase the risk of all-cause mortality (RR 1.06; 95% CI 0.99 to 1.13), stroke (RR 1.14; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.29), and probably also cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.11; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.25). Little to no difference was observed for myocardial infarction (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.88 to 1.03) and sudden cardiac death (RR 1.08; 95% CI 0.90 to 1.31). Meta-analyses at 24±6 months follow-up showed that antibiotics increased the risk of all-cause mortality (RR 1.25; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.48), cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.50; 95% CI 1.17 to 1.91), and probably also sudden cardiac death (RR 1.77; 95% CI 1.28 to 2.44). No evidence of a difference was found for myocardial infarction or stroke at this time point. Meta-analyses of trials at low risk of bias differed only for cardiovascular mortality at maximum follow-up; all other outcomes were consistent with overall analyses. None of the trials specifically assessed serious adverse events according to ICH-GCP, and no data were available on quality of life. Current evidence suggests that antibiotics (macrolides or quinolones) for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease appear harmful when assessing all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and stroke at maximum follow-up, as well as all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and sudden cardiac death at 24±6 months follow-up. Therefore, current evidence does not support the clinical use of macrolides or quinolones for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease. Future trials examining the safety of these antibiotics for this purpose do not seem ethical, and antibiotic trials in general require longer follow-up to capture late adverse events.","Coronary heart disease, also known as cardiovascular disease, is the leading cause of death worldwide with approximately 7.4 million deaths each year. Coronary heart disease is caused by decreased blood supply to the heart. The severity of the disease ranges from chest pain during exercise to heart attack. Antibiotics might help patients with coronary heart disease and reduce their risk of heart attacks, strokes, chest pain, revascularisation procedures, and death. However, a randomised clinical trial and several observational studies suggested that antibiotics increased the risk of cardiovascular events and death. The aim of this Cochrane systematic review was to assess the benefits and harms of antibiotics in adult patients with coronary heart disease. We primarily assessed the benefits and harms at maximum follow-up and secondly at 24±6 months follow-up. We searched various scientific databases from their inception to December 2019 and found 38 trials where people with coronary heart disease were randomly allocated to antibiotics versus placebo or no intervention. The 38 trials included 26,638 adults with a mean age of 61.6 years. 23 out of the 38 trials reported data on 26,078 participants that could be analysed. The vast majority of the data was contributed by trials assessing the effects of macrolide antibiotics (28 trials; 22,059 participants) and quinolone antibiotics (two trials; 4162 participants), while insufficient data were contributed by trials assessing the effects of tetracycline antibiotics (eight trials; 417 participants). Three trials were at low risk of bias and the remaining trials were at high risk of bias. Patients receiving antibiotics (macrolide antibiotics or quinolone antibiotics) compared with patients receiving placebo or no intervention seemed at a slightly higher risk of death from all causes, death from a cardiac cause, and having a stroke at maximum follow-up. Moreover, a slightly higher risk was also observed when assessing death from all causes, death from a cardiac cause, and sudden death from a cardiac cause at 24±6 months follow-up. None of the trials sufficiently reported the number of participants with serious adverse events. No data were provided on quality of life. Future trials on the safety of macrolide antibiotics or quinolone antibiotics for the secondary prevention in adult patients with coronary heart disease do not seem ethical.",1045,Coronary heart disease; myocardial infarction; stroke; secondary prevention; macrolides; quinolones; placebo; cardiovascular mortality,How might the risk of bias in trials impact the interpretation of results regarding antibiotics for coronary heart disease?,What rationale can be evaluated for not supporting further trials of antibiotics as secondary prevention for coronary heart disease?,Select all of the following that are fruits,What was the primary aim of the Cochrane systematic review?,What was the result of the meta-analyses at maximum follow-up regarding all-cause mortality?,They could overestimate the beneficial effects of antibiotics; They ensure that the results are more reliable; They could lead to underreporting of adverse events,They could overestimate the beneficial effects of antibiotics; They could lead to underreporting of adverse events,Evidence indicates potential harm in terms of mortality; Antibiotics have consistently shown beneficial effects; Concerns about ethical considerations in patient safety,Evidence indicates potential harm in terms of mortality; Concerns about ethical considerations in patient safety,dog; blue; grape,grape,To assess the benefits and harms of antibiotics in adult patients with coronary heart disease.; To compare different types of antibiotics for various diseases.; To evaluate the effectiveness of new surgical procedures for heart disease.,To assess the benefits and harms of antibiotics in adult patients with coronary heart disease.,Antibiotics increased the risk of all-cause mortality.; Antibiotics decreased the risk of all-cause mortality.; There was no difference in all-cause mortality.,Antibiotics increased the risk of all-cause mortality.
56259489ed6e5a0005c80fde,interactive_3,Thienopyridine derivatives versus aspirin for preventing stroke and other serious vascular events in high vascular risk patients,"Aspirin is the most widely studied and prescribed antiplatelet agent for preventing serious vascular events, reducing the odds of such events among high vascular risk patients by about a quarter. Thienopyridine derivatives inhibit platelet activation by a different mechanism and so may be more effective. To determine the effectiveness and safety of thienopyridine derivatives (ticlopidine and clopidogrel) versus aspirin for preventing serious vascular events (stroke, myocardial infarction (MI) or vascular death) in patients at high risk, and specifically in patients with a previous TIA or ischaemic stroke. We searched the trials registers of the Stroke, Heart and Peripheral Vascular Diseases Cochrane Review Groups (last searched July 2008), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2008), MEDLINE (1966 to August 2008) and EMBASE (1980 to August 2008). We also searched reference lists of relevant papers, and contacted other researchers and the pharmaceutical company Sanofi-BMS (December 2008). All unconfounded, double blind, randomised trials directly comparing a thienopyridine derivative with aspirin in high vascular risk patients. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. We sought additional data from the principal investigators of the largest trials. We included 10 trials involving 26,865 high vascular risk patients. The trials were generally of high quality. Aspirin was compared with ticlopidine in nine trials (7633 patients) and with clopidogrel in one trial (19,185 patients). Compared with aspirin, allocation to a thienopyridine produced a modest, just statistically significant, reduction in the odds of a serious vascular event (11.6% versus 12.5%; odds ratio (OR) 0.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85 to 0.99), corresponding to the avoidance of 10 (95% CI 0 to 20) serious vascular events per 1000 patients treated for about two years. However, the wide confidence interval includes the possibility of negligible additional benefit. Compared with aspirin, thienopyridines significantly reduced gastrointestinal adverse effects. However, thienopyridines increased the odds of skin rash and diarrhoea, ticlopidine more than clopidogrel. Allocation to ticlopidine, but not clopidogrel, significantly increased the odds of neutropenia. In patients with TIA/ischaemic stroke, the results were similar to those for all patients combined. The thienopyridine derivatives are at least as effective as aspirin in preventing serious vascular events in patients at high risk, and possibly somewhat more so. However, the size of any additional benefit is uncertain and could be negligible. Clopidogrel has a more favourable adverse effects profile than ticlopidine and so is the thienopyridine of choice. It should be used as an alternative to aspirin in patients genuinely intolerant of or allergic to aspirin.","Most strokes and heart attacks are caused by a blood clot blocking the blood supply to part of the brain (to cause stroke) or to the heart (to cause a heart attack). Aspirin prevents blood clots forming, and it can reduce the risk of a further heart attack or stroke in people who have had a stroke or heart attack or other symptoms of vascular disease. Clopidogrel and ticlopidine are two similar drugs called thienopyridines which prevent clots in a different way to aspirin. This review of 10 trials comparing either clopidogrel or ticlopidine with aspirin in about 27,000 people found that clopidogrel and ticlopidine were at least as effective as aspirin for the prevention of stroke and heart attacks, and might be slightly more effective. In terms of adverse effects, compared with aspirin, clopidogrel and ticlopidine caused less stomach upset and less bleeding from the gut, but more diarrhoea and skin rash. Ticlopidine produced more of these last two adverse effects than clopidogrel when compared with aspirin. Ticlopidine can also cause suppression of the bone marrow production of blood cells, which can be a serious complication. Clopidogrel is therefore the thienopyridine of choice since it is safer and better tolerated. However, since it is substantially more expensive than aspirin and not clearly more effective, it should generally only be used instead of aspirin in patients who are unable to take aspirin.",1071,Antiplatelet agent; Thienopyridine derivatives; Platelet activation; Vascular events; Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA); Ticlopidine; Clopidogrel; Gastrointestinal adverse effects; Neutropenia; Adverse effects profile,What is the primary purpose of aspirin in patients with previous stroke or heart attack?,Which of the following describes the main comparison in the study?,Select all of the following that are colors,"According to the summary, what were the two main adverse effects more common with thienopyridines?",Which thienopyridine is recommended as an alternative to aspirin based on its safety profile?,To prevent blood clots from forming; To cure strokes and heart attacks; To increase bone marrow production,To prevent blood clots from forming,Comparing thienopyridines with aspirin; Comparing aspirin with placebos; Comparing ticlopidine with clopidogrel,Comparing thienopyridines with aspirin,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Diarrhoea and skin rash; Heart attack and stroke; Neutropenia and bone pain,Diarrhoea and skin rash,Clopidogrel; Ticlopidine; Aspirin,Clopidogrel
56259489ed6e5a0005c80fde,interactive_4,Treatments to reduce body temperature to 35C in people who are in hospital after a traumatic brain injury,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and disability, with an estimated 5.5 million people experiencing severe TBI worldwide every year. Observational clinical studies suggest a link between raised body temperature and unfavourable outcomes, though findings are inconsistent. Preclinical models indicate that reducing temperature to 35C to 37.5C may improve biological outcomes compared to deeper cooling (33C). It remains unknown whether reducing body temperature to 35C in people admitted to hospital with TBI is beneficial, neutral, or harmful. This review updates a previous version published in 2014. We aimed to assess the effects of pharmacological or physical interventions designed to reduce body temperature to 35C in adults and children hospitalised after TBI. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, PubMed, clinical trial registers, grey literature, reference lists, and forward citations up to 28 November 2019. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving participants of any age admitted after TBI and receiving interventions intended to lower body temperature within the target range, including medications (paracetamol, NSAIDs) or physical cooling methods (surface cooling devices, bedside fans, cooled intravenous fluids). Eligible comparators were placebo or usual care. Two authors independently assessed studies, extracted data, and evaluated risk of bias, using GRADE to assess certainty of evidence. Only one RCT with 41 adult participants, conducted in two Australian intensive care units, met the criteria. Participants received intravenous paracetamol (1 g every four hours for 72 hours) or a matched placebo. We were uncertain whether paracetamol influenced 28-day mortality (risk ratio 2.86, 95% CI 0.32 to 25.24). The certainty of evidence was very low due to imprecision (small sample size) and selective reporting concerns, although other risks of bias were low. The study did not report the primary outcome of poor outcome at follow-up (death or dependency) or any secondary outcomes of interest, including intracranial or extracranial haemorrhage, abnormal intracranial pressure, or pneumonia or other serious infections. We found one additional completed trial of a physical intervention (advanced fever control using a surface cooling device versus standard fever control in 12 participants), but it was published only as an abstract with insufficient details for inclusion; it is listed as awaiting classification pending further information. Four ongoing trials may contribute data to future updates if they report relevant outcomes and provide separate results for participants with TBI when mixed populations are included. In conclusion, one small study contributed very low-certainty evidence on mortality. Overall uncertainty is driven by extremely limited research on interventions aimed at reducing body temperature to 35C after TBI. More research evaluating both pharmacological and physical interventions is needed. Future studies should include outcomes important to patients, such as side effects (e.g., nausea, vomiting) and discomfort caused by cooling therapies.","Traumatic brain injury occurs when direct force to the headsuch as from a road traffic accident or a fall causes damage to the brain. It is a major global health problem, affecting about 5.5 million people each year. Injury occurs in two stages: first at the moment of impact, and then over the following hours to weeks as secondary damage develops. Treatment aims to limit this secondary damage. Some evidence suggests that people with normal body temperature after injury may have better outcomes than those with elevated temperatures. This review examined whether medicines or non-drug physical cooling methods that reduce body temperature to between 35C improve outcomes for adults or children hospitalized after traumatic brain injury. We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs)the most reliable type of evidence up to 28 November 2019. Only one small RCT with 41 participants was found. It compared intravenous paracetamol, given for 72 hours, with an intravenous salt solution made to look identical. No published trials assessed other medicines or physical cooling methods such as cooling blankets, ice, fans, or cooled fluids. One very small study of physical cooling was identified but lacked enough information for inclusion, and four ongoing studies may provide future evidence. Some of these include mixed types of brain injury, and we will only be able to use them if they report traumatic brain injury results separately. We were uncertain whether paracetamol reduced deaths within 28 days because the study was very small and did not originally plan to report mortality. It also did not report any of our key outcomes, such as poor functional outcome (death or dependency), serious bleeding inside or outside the brain, raised intracranial pressure, pneumonia, or other infections. Although the study methods were generally sound, the lack of pre-specified reporting increased the risk of bias. With only one small study, the certainty of the evidence was very low, meaning the true effects may be very different from what was reported. Overall, we remain uncertain whether medicines or physical cooling treatments that lower body temperature to 35C benefit people in hospital after traumatic brain injury. More and larger studies are needed, and future updates will assess side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and discomfort, which we hope ongoing and future research will report.",1056,Traumatic brain injury; pharmacological interventions; physical cooling methods; certainty of evidence; imprecision; intracranial pressure; extracranial haemorrhage; pneumonia; advanced fever control,What were the motivations for the study's focus on cooling treatments for TBI?,Which factors contributed to the uncertainty of the study results on paracetamol?,Select all of the following that are colors,"Based on the study, what can be concluded about the use of cooling methods in reducing TBI mortality rates?",Explain the main goal of the study in your own words.,Elevated body temperatures suggest potentially worse outcomes for TBI patients.; Normal body temperature is universally accepted to improve brain injury outcomes.; Cooling treatments have been consistently proven in other unrelated medical contexts.,Elevated body temperatures suggest potentially worse outcomes for TBI patients.,The study used a too short duration of treatment.; The small sample size and lack of pre-planned mortality reporting.; The study confirmed that all key outcomes were reported comprehensively.,The small sample size and lack of pre-planned mortality reporting.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,The study provides strong evidence that cooling methods reduce mortality.; Cooling methods' impact on mortality is uncertain due to the study's limited scope.; Mortality rates increase significantly with the use of cooling methods.,Cooling methods' impact on mortality is uncertain due to the study's limited scope.,To determine if cooling to 35-37.5Â°C improves outcomes after TBI; To establish the best surgical intervention for TBI; To identify genetic markers of TBI,To determine if cooling to 35-37.5Â°C improves outcomes after TBI
56259489ed6e5a0005c80fde,interactive_4,Chelation therapy for atherosclerotic cardiovascular (heart and circulation) disease,"Chelation therapy is promoted and practiced around the world as a form of alternative medicine in the treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. It has been suggested as a safe, relatively inexpensive, non-surgical method of restoring blood flow in atherosclerotic vessels. However, there is currently limited high-quality, adequately-powered research informing evidence-based medicine on the topic, specifically regarding clinical outcomes. Due to this limited evidence, the benefit of chelation therapy remains controversial at present. This is an update of a review first published in 2002.
To assess the effects of ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) chelation therapy versus placebo or no treatment on clinical outcomes among people with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.
For this update, the Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) databases, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials register to 6 August 2019. We searched the bibliographies of the studies retrieved by the literature searches for further trials.
We included studies if they were randomised controlled trials of EDTA chelation therapy versus placebo or no treatment in participants with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The main outcome measures we considered include all-cause or cause-specific mortality, non-fatal cardiovascular events, direct or indirect measurement of disease severity, and subjective measures of improvement or adverse events.
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality using standard Cochrane procedures. A third author considered any unresolved issues, and we discussed any discrepancies until a consensus was reached. We contacted study authors for additional information.
We included five studies with a total of 1993 randomised participants. Three studies enrolled participants with peripheral vascular disease and two studies included participants with coronary artery disease, one of which specifically recruited people who had had a myocardial infarction. The number of participants in each study varied widely (from 10 to 1708 participants), but all studies compared EDTA chelation to a placebo. Risk of bias for the included studies was generally moderate to low, but one study had high risk of bias because the study investigators broke their randomisation code halfway through the study and rolled the placebo participants over to active treatment. Certainty of the evidence, as assessed by GRADE, was generally low to very low, which was mostly due to a paucity of data in each outcome's meta-analysis. This limited our ability to draw any strong conclusions. We also had concerns about one study's risk of bias regarding blinding and outcome assessment that may have biased the results. Two studies with coronary artery disease participants reported no evidence of a difference in all-cause mortality between chelation therapy and placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.97, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.28; 1792 participants; low-certainty). One study with coronary artery disease participants reported no evidence of a difference in coronary heart disease deaths between chelation therapy and placebo (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.48; 1708 participants; very low-certainty). Two studies with coronary artery disease participants reported no evidence of a difference in myocardial infarction (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.14; 1792 participants; moderate-certainty), angina (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.67; 1792 participants; very low-certainty), and coronary revascularisation (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.07 to 3.25; 1792 participants). Two studies (one with coronary artery disease participants and one with peripheral vascular disease participants) reported no evidence of a difference in stroke (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.92; 1867 participants; low-certainty). Ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI; also known as ankle brachial index) was measured in three studies, all including participants with peripheral vascular disease; two studies found no evidence of a difference in the treatment groups after three months after treatment (mean difference (MD) 0.02, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.06; 181 participants; low-certainty). A third study reported an improvement in ABPI in the EDTA chelation group, but this study was at high risk of bias. Meta-analysis of maximum and pain-free walking distances three months after treatment included participants with peripheral vascular disease and showed no evidence of a difference between the treatment groups (MD -31.46, 95% CI -87.63 to 24.71; 165 participants; 2 studies; low-certainty). Quality of life outcomes were reported by two studies that included participants with coronary artery disease, but we were unable to pool the data due to different methods of reporting and varied criteria. However, there did not appear to be any major differences between the treatment groups. None of the included studies reported on vascular deaths. Overall, there was no evidence of major or minor adverse events associated with EDTA chelation treatment.
There is currently insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of chelation therapy in improving clinical outcomes of people with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. More high-quality, randomised controlled trials are needed that assess the effects of chelation therapy on longevity and quality of life among people with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.","Atherosclerosis is caused by fatty deposits that cause a narrowing of people's arteries and restrict blood flow. People with blocked arteries are more likely to have strokes, heart attacks, and narrow blood vessels in their feet. Chelation therapy involves infusions into the bloodstream of substances believed to remove metals from the blood. This treatment is offered to people with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease as a way of breaking down the blockages in their blood vessels. Chelation therapy is practiced in several places around the world as an alternative form of medicine, but there is currently a lack of knowledge surrounding this treatment. More information is needed to understand if this treatment should be more widely recommended.
We considered most of the data we found to be of low certainty, mostly because there were very few studies that provided data. Even though we included five studies, not all of them reported on each outcome. There is currently not enough evidence about the effects of chelation therapy on blockages in the blood vessels of people with atherosclerotic cardiovascular (heart and circulation) disease.
Overall, this review did not find any clear differences between people treated with chelation and people given the control, for the outcomes we evaluated. None of the outcomes included more than two studies, therefore it is difficult at this time to determine if these are true findings or just because there is not enough data.

56259489ed6e5a0005c80fde,finetuned_5,Ivermectin for preventing and treating COVID-19,"Ivermectin, an antiparasitic agent, inhibits the replication of viruses in vitro, and the molecular hypothesis of its antiviral mode of action suggests an inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2 replication in early stages of infection, although current evidence on ivermectin for prevention of infection and treatment of COVID-19 is conflicting. The objective was to assess the efficacy and safety of ivermectin plus standard of care compared to standard of care plus or minus placebo, or any other proven intervention, for people with COVID-19 receiving inpatient or outpatient treatment, and for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection as postexposure prophylaxis. We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, Web of Science, WHO COVID-19 Global literature, and the HTA database weekly without language restrictions to 16 December 2021, and additionally included trials with more than 1000 participants up to April 2022. We included randomized controlled trials comparing ivermectin to standard of care, placebo, or another proven intervention for treatment of confirmed COVID-19, irrespective of disease severity or setting, and for prevention of infection, with co-interventions required to be the same in both groups; in this update we reappraised eligible trials for research integrity, including only prospectively registered RCTs according to WHO guidelines. We assessed RCTs for bias using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool and used GRADE to rate certainty of evidence for outcomes in inpatients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19, outpatients with mild COVID-19, and for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We excluded seven of the 14 trials from the previous review because six were not prospectively registered and one was non-randomized; the updated review includes 11 trials with 3409 participants investigating ivermectin plus standard of care compared to standard of care plus or minus placebo. No trial investigated ivermectin for prevention or compared it to an intervention with proven efficacy. Five trials treated moderate COVID-19 in inpatient settings and six treated mild COVID-19 in outpatient settings; eight trials were double-blind and placebo-controlled, and three were open-label, with around 50% of results assessed as low risk of bias. We identified 31 ongoing trials and 28 potentially eligible trials without published results or with reporting disparities, held in awaiting classification until authors clarify details. For treating moderate-to-severe inpatient COVID-19, we are uncertain whether ivermectin plus standard of care reduces or increases all-cause mortality at 28 days (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.14 to 2.51; 3 trials, 230 participants; very low-certainty evidence), clinical worsening measured by new need for ventilation or death (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.33 to 2.04; 2 trials, 118 participants; very low-certainty evidence), or serious adverse events (RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.07 to 35.89; 2 trials, 197 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Ivermectin plus standard of care may have little or no effect on clinical improvement measured by discharge alive at day 28 (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.35; 1 trial, 73 participants; low-certainty evidence), on any adverse events during the trial (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.79; 3 trials, 228 participants; low-certainty evidence), and on viral clearance at seven days (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.58; 3 trials, 231 participants; low-certainty evidence); no trial investigated quality of life. For treating outpatients with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19, ivermectin plus standard of care probably has little or no effect on all-cause mortality at day 28 (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.25; 6 trials, 2860 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and little or no effect on quality of life measured with the PROMIS Global-10 scale (physical and mental component MD 0.00, 95% CI ranges crossing 0; 1358 participants; high-certainty evidence). Ivermectin may have little or no effect on clinical worsening measured by hospital admission or death (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.20 to 6.02; 2 trials, 590 participants; low-certainty evidence), clinical improvement measured by resolution of symptoms by day 14 (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.36; 2 trials, 478 participants; low-certainty evidence), serious adverse events (RR 2.27, 95% CI 0.62 to 8.31; 5 trials, 1502 participants; low-certainty evidence), any adverse events (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.76; 5 trials, 1502 participants; low-certainty evidence), and viral clearance at day 7 (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.48; 2 trials, 331 participants; low-certainty evidence); no trials reporting duration of symptoms were eligible for meta-analysis. For outpatients, there is currently low- to high-certainty evidence that ivermectin has no beneficial effect for people with COVID-19, and based on very low-certainty evidence for inpatients, we remain uncertain whether ivermectin prevents death or clinical worsening or increases serious adverse events, while low-certainty evidence suggests no beneficial effect on clinical improvement, viral clearance, or adverse events; no evidence is available for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this update, certainty increased due to higher-quality trials with more participants, and according to the living review approach, searches will continue to be updated.","Ivermectin is a medicine used to treat parasites, such as intestinal parasites in animals and scabies in humans, and is inexpensive and widely used where parasitic infestations are common, with few unwanted effects; medical regulators have not approved ivermectin for COVID-19. We wanted to update our knowledge of whether ivermectin reduces death, illness, and length of infection in people with COVID-19, or is useful in prevention, and included trials comparing the medicine to placebo, usual care, or treatments known to work to some extent such as dexamethasone, while excluding trials comparing ivermectin to medicines that do not work, like hydroxychloroquine, or whose effectiveness is uncertain. We evaluated effects of ivermectin in infected people on people dying, whether COVID-19 got better or worse, quality of life, serious and non-serious unwanted effects, and viral clearance; for prevention, we sought effects on preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease. We searched for randomized controlled trials investigating ivermectin to prevent or treat COVID-19, requiring laboratory-confirmed infections for hospital or outpatient participants, and in this update also investigated trustworthiness of trials, including them only if they fulfilled clear ethical and scientific criteria; we compared and summarized results and rated confidence in the evidence based on common criteria such as trial methods and sizes. We excluded seven of the 14 trials from the previous review as they did not fulfil expected criteria, and with four new trials included 11 trials with 3409 participants investigating ivermectin with usual care compared with the same usual care or placebo; for treatment, five trials were in hospital with moderate COVID-19 and six trials in outpatients with mild COVID-19, using different doses and treatment durations, and no trial investigated ivermectin for prevention; we also found 31 ongoing trials and 28 additional trials requiring clarification or not yet published. Treating people in hospital with COVID-19, we do not know whether ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment leads to more or fewer deaths, worsens or improves condition measured by need for ventilation or death, or increases or reduces serious unwanted events; ivermectin may make little or no difference to improving condition measured by discharge or to non-serious unwanted events, and seven days after treatment may make little or no difference to reduction of negative tests. Treating outpatients with COVID-19, ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment probably makes little or no difference to people dying and makes little or no difference to quality of life; it may make little or no difference to worsening condition measured by admission or death, serious unwanted events, non-serious unwanted events, improvement of symptoms in 14 days, or negative tests at seven days. Our confidence in the evidence, especially for outpatients, improved since the last review because more participants were included in high-quality trials, and although we are quite certain about risk of dying and quality of life, confidence is still low for many other outcomes because few events were measured, methods differed, and not all relevant outcomes were reported.",1109,Ivermectin; SARS-CoV-2; antiparasitic agent; postexposure prophylaxis; co-interventions; WHO guidelines; all-cause mortality; serious adverse events; clinical improvement; viral clearance,How could the exclusion of certain trials from the analysis impact the confidence in the study's conclusions?,What are the implications of finding little or no effect of ivermectin on the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients?,Select all of the following that are colors,"Considering the studyÃ¢ÂÂs findings, how might future research on ivermectin's use in COVID-19 treatment be designed?",What was the main objective of the study discussed in the summary?,It increases confidence by ensuring higher-quality evidence; It decreases confidence as fewer trials are considered; It has no impact since only reliable data is excluded,It increases confidence by ensuring higher-quality evidence,Ivermectin should not be used as a standard treatment for COVID-19; Ivermectin should be used in combination with other treatments; The use of ivermectin is justified in certain emergency situations,Ivermectin should not be used as a standard treatment for COVID-19,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,"Focus on larger-scale, high-quality, double-blind trials; Incorporate non-randomized participants to increase diversity; Reduce the number of placebo controls to simplify results","Focus on larger-scale, high-quality, double-blind trials",To assess the efficacy and safety of ivermectin compared to standard care.; To measure the economic impact of ivermectin.; To develop new antiparasitic drugs.,To assess the efficacy and safety of ivermectin compared to standard care.
56259489ed6e5a0005c80fde,finetuned_6,Statins for the prevention of dementia,"This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2001 and then updated in 2009. Vascular risk factors including high cholesterol levels increase the risk of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease and of vascular dementia. Some observational studies have suggested an association between statin use and lowered incidence of dementia.
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of statins for the prevention of dementia in people at risk of dementia due to their age and to determine whether the efficacy and safety of statins for this purpose depends on cholesterol level, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype or cognitive level.
We searched ALOIS (the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group), The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) Portal on 11 November 2015. We included double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials in which statins were administered for at least 12 months to people at risk of dementia. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We included two trials with 26,340 participants aged 40 to 82 years of whom 11,610 were aged 70 or older. All participants had a history of, or risk factors for, vascular disease. The studies used different statins (simvastatin and pravastatin). Mean follow-up was 3.2 years in one study and five years in one study. The risk of bias was low. Only one study reported on the incidence of dementia (20,536 participants, 31 cases in each group; odds ratio (OR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61 to 1.65, moderate quality evidence, downgraded due to imprecision). Both studies assessed cognitive function, but at different times using different scales, so we judged the results unsuitable for a meta-analysis. There were no differences between statin and placebo groups on five different cognitive tests (high quality evidence). Rates of treatment discontinuation due to non-fatal adverse events were less than 5% in both studies and there was no difference between statin and placebo groups in the risk of withdrawal due to adverse events (26,340 participants, 2 studies, OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.05). There is good evidence that statins given in late life to people at risk of vascular disease do not prevent cognitive decline or dementia. Biologically, it seems feasible that statins could prevent dementia due to their role in cholesterol reduction and initial evidence from observational studies was very promising. However, indication bias may have been a factor in these studies and the evidence from subsequent RCTs has been negative. There were limitations in the included studies involving the cognitive assessments used and the inclusion of participants at moderate to high vascular risk only.","Dementia (including Alzheimer's disease) is a global healthcare concern; the number of people affected worldwide is predicted to double every 20 years, reaching 74.7 million in 2010 and 131.5 million in 2050. Therefore, it is important to find means of preventing dementia. It has been suggested that high levels of cholesterol in the serum (part of the blood) may increase the risk of dementia and that treatment with cholesterol-lowering medicines such as statins may reduce the risk of dementia. We searched medical databases for clinical trials comparing giving a statin to giving a placebo (pretend medicine) to people with normal cognitive function (which is brain activities that allow us to gain and use knowledge) and of sufficient age to be at risk of Alzheimer's disease. There were limitations in the included studies involving the methods of assessment of cognition and the inclusion only of participants deemed to be of moderate to high risk of a problem with their blood (vascular) system. Nevertheless, there was good evidence that statins given in late life to people at risk of vascular disease do not prevent cognitive decline or dementia.",1131,dementia; statins; Alzheimer's disease; vascular dementia; apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype; cognitive decline; vascular risk factors; cholesterol reduction; adverse events; incidence of dementia,What key limitations in the studies may have impacted the conclusions about statins and dementia prevention?,Why might the biological mechanism of statins suggest potential for dementia prevention?,Select all of the following that are colors,Summarize the conclusion about the effect of statins on cognitive decline.,Explain the proposed relationship between cholesterol levels and dementia risk.,The methods of cognition assessment used; The exclusion of participants with low vascular risk; The lack of placebo control,The methods of cognition assessment used; The exclusion of participants with low vascular risk,Statins are known for their cholesterol-reducing role; Statins enhance cognitive function directly; Statins alter brain structure to prevent decline,Statins are known for their cholesterol-reducing role,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Statins do not prevent cognitive decline; Statins significantly increase cognitive function; Statins have an unpredictable effect on cognition,Statins do not prevent cognitive decline,High cholesterol may increase dementia risk; Low cholesterol directly causes dementia; Cholesterol has no link to dementia risk,High cholesterol may increase dementia risk
56259489ed6e5a0005c80fde,finetuned_6,"Does cardiovascular training relieve cancer-related fatigue before, during, or after anticancer therapy?","To evaluate the effects of cardiovascular training on cancer-related fatigue (CRF), quality of life (QoL), adverse events, anxiety, and depression in people with cancer, with regard to their stage of anticancer therapy (before, during, or after), up to 12 weeks, up to six months, or longer, postintervention.
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov and World Health Organization ICTRP to identify studies that are included in the review. The latest search date was October 2023.
Moderate-certainty evidence shows that cardiovascular training by people with cancer during their anticancer therapy slightly reduces short-term CRF and results in little to no difference in short-term QoL. We do not know whether cardiovascular training increases or decreases medium-term CRF/QoL, and long-term CRF/QoL. There is very low-certainty evidence (due to heterogeneous definitions, reporting and measurement) evaluating whether the training increases or decreases adverse events. In people with cancer who perform cardiovascular training after anticancer therapy, we are uncertain about the effects on short-term CRF/QoL, long-term CRF/QoL, and adverse events. We identified a lack of evidence concerning cardiovascular training before anticancer therapy and on safety outcomes. The 36 ongoing and 12 completed, but unpublished, studies could help close this gap, and could contribute to improving the effect estimates and certainty.
This Cochrane review was funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research of Germany, grant number: FKZ 01KG2017.","What is cancer-related fatigue? Cancer-related fatigue is an extreme feeling of tiredness over a long period of time. It can be caused by cancer treatment or the cancer itself. It is the most common symptom among people with cancer. It cannot be relieved by rest, and it affects the body and mind. What is cardiovascular training? Cardiovascular training is any activity that uses the large muscle groups of the buttocks and thighs, and increases heart and breathing rate. Examples are walking, running, cycling, and swimming. Why is cardiovascular training possibly effective for cancer-related fatigue? Cancer-related fatigue is linked to the body's response to cytokines, which regulate how tissues and organs increase in size (called cell growth). Cancer or cancer therapy may produce proteins called pro-inflammatory cytokines, which cause or worsen inflammation (the body's response to an injury or illness). Cardiovascular training can help reduce inflammation. What did we want to find out? We wanted to know whether cardiovascular training reduces cancer-related fatigue compared to no training. We explored the effects at short (up to 12 weeks), medium (up to six months), and long term (longer than six months). We also looked at quality of life, unwanted effects, anxiety, and depression. What did we do? We searched for studies that investigated cardiovascular training before, during, or after anticancer therapy compared to no training. These studies needed to evaluate cancer-related fatigue or quality of life, or both. The cardiovascular training needed at least five exercise sessions and had to be provided face-to-face, either in person or by video. We excluded studies with fewer than 20 people per group or studies only available in short-summary form. What did we find? We found 23 studies with 2135 people, mostly women with breast cancer. Most studies were conducted in high-income countries. A total of 1101 people received cardiovascular training and 1034 received no training. We also found 36 ongoing studies and 12 completed but unpublished studies. Main results: There were no studies comparing cardiovascular training before anticancer therapy with no training. We included 10 studies of cardiovascular training during anticancer therapy but could use only eight in our analyses. For cardiovascular training after anticancer therapy versus no training, we found 13 studies but could use only nine. Cardiovascular training during anticancer therapy probably reduces short-term cancer-related fatigue slightly (6 studies, 593 people) and probably results in little to no difference in short-term quality of life (6 studies, 612 people). It is unclear whether cardiovascular training affects medium- or long-term fatigue, quality of life, or unwanted effects. For cardiovascular training after anticancer therapy, we do not know whether it increases or decreases short- or long-term fatigue, quality of life, or unwanted effects, and no data were available for medium-term effects. What are the limitations of the evidence? We are moderately confident in the evidence on short-term fatigue and quality of life during anticancer therapy. Our confidence in all other results is very low because the studies were fewer, smaller, or had design limitations such as lack of blinding.

66b01097e95b0626c2cd7b5c,static_1,Revascularisation of the left subclavian artery for thoracic endovascular aortic repair,"Controversy exists as to whether revascularisation of the left subclavian artery (LSA) confers improved outcomes in patients undergoing thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR). Even though preemptive revascularisation of the LSA has theoretical advantages, including a reduced risk of ischaemic damage to vital organs, such as the brain and the spinal cord, it is not without risks. Current practice guidelines recommend routine revascularisation of the LSA in patients undergoing elective TEVAR where achievement of a proximal seal necessitates coverage of the LSA, and in patients who have an anatomy that compromises perfusion to critical organs. However, this recommendation was based on very low-quality evidence. To assess the comparative efficacy of routine LSA revascularisation versus either selective or no revascularisation in patients with descending thoracic aortic disease undergoing TEVAR with coverage of the LSA origin. The Cochrane Vascular Trials Search Co-ordinator (TSC) searched the Specialised Register (June 2015). In addition, the TSC searched the Cochrane Register of Studies (CENTRAL (2015, Issue 5)).Trials databases were also searched (June 2015). We had planned to consider all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared routine revascularisation of the LSA with selective or no revascularisation, in patients undergoing TEVAR. Two review authors independently assessed the title and abstract of articles identified through literature searches. An independent third review author was consulted in the event of disagreement. We had planned for two review authors to independently extract data and assess the risk of bias of identified trials using the criteria recommended in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We did not identify any RCTs relevant to our review topic. Therefore, no quantitative analysis was conducted. High quality RCT evidence for or against routine or selective revascularisation of the LSA in TEVAR is not currently available. It is not possible to draw conclusions with regard to the optimal management of LSA coverage in TEVAR, and whether routine revascularisation, which was defined as the intervention of interest in our review, confers beneficial effects, as indicated by reduced mortality, cerebrovascular events, and spinal cord ischaemia. This review highlights the need for continued research to provide RCT evidence and define the role of LSA revascularisation in the context of TEVAR with coverage of the LSA.","The thoracic aorta is the largest blood vessel in the chest. It originates from the heart and supplies blood to the whole body. It can be affected by several diseases, including an aneurysm, which is an enlargement of a weakened section of the aorta, and dissection, which occurs when a tear in the aortic lining causes blood to flow between the layers of the wall of the aorta, forcing the layers apart. The traditional treatment of these conditions is open surgical repair. Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) has evolved as an alternative treatment for a wide variety of aortic diseases. It is less invasive than open surgery, and involves inserting an artificial graft (a tube composed of fabric) into the thoracic aorta through an artery in the groin (the femoral artery), to help reinforce the aortic wall. A significant proportion of patients with thoracic aortic disease have abnormalities close to, or involving the origin of the left subclavian artery (LSA; one of the branches of the thoracic aorta). In these situations, the aortic stent graft needs to be placed close to the LSA, thereby blocking the blood vessel opening. This can potentially result in reduced blood supply to the brain and spinal cord, causing stroke and spinal cord ischaemia (spinal cord stroke). This review aimed to look at the value of a surgical bypass, which can provide an alternative route for blood supply (revascularisation) to the brain and spinal cord in cases of TEVAR, where the LSA is covered. Controversy exists as to whether routine revascularisation of the LSA, with a surgical bypass, results in improved outcomes in patients undergoing TEVAR, as measured by a reduced risk of stroke and paraplegia (paralysis of the legs). Even though preemptive LSA revascularisation has theoretical advantages, it is not without risks, including nerve damage, bleeding, and graft infection. The Society for Vascular Surgery Practice Guidelines recommend routine revascularisation of the LSA in non-emergency TEVAR, where the LSA origin is covered. However, this recommendation was based on very low-quality evidence. We undertook a comprehensive, systematic search of the pertinent literature to identify the best available evidence and had planned to synthesise outcome data from randomised controlled trials (RCTs), in order to assist clinicians and patients to make evidence-based decisions. We did not identify any RCTs investigating our study question (evidence current until June 2015). The best available evidence comes from non-randomised comparative studies. There is a need for high quality RCTs providing more robust evidence.

66b01097e95b0626c2cd7b5c,static_2,Collaborative care for people with depression and anxiety,"Common mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety, are estimated to affect up to 15% of the UK population at any one time, and health care systems worldwide need to implement interventions to reduce the impact and burden of these conditions; collaborative care is a complex intervention based on chronic disease management models that may be effective in the management of these common mental health problems. To assess the effectiveness of collaborative care for patients with depression or anxiety, we searched databases to February 2012, including The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group (CCDAN) trials registers (CCDANCTR-References and CCDANCTR-Studies) which include relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from MEDLINE (1950 to present), EMBASE (1974 to present), PsycINFO (1967 to present) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, all years), as well as the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal (ICTRP), ClinicalTrials.gov, and CINAHL (to November 2010 only), and we screened the reference lists of reports of all included studies and published systematic reviews for reports of additional studies. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of collaborative care for participants of all ages with depression or anxiety were included; two independent researchers extracted data using a standardised data extraction sheet, made 'Risk of bias' assessments using criteria from The Cochrane Collaboration, combined continuous measures of outcome using standardised mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), combined dichotomous measures using risk ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs, and conducted sensitivity analyses to test robustness. We included seventy-nine RCTs (including 90 relevant comparisons) involving 24,308 participants in the review, and studies varied in terms of risk of bias. The results of primary analyses demonstrated significantly greater improvement in depression outcomes for adults with depression treated with the collaborative care model in the short-term (SMD -0.34, 95% CI -0.41 to -0.27; RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.43), medium-term (SMD -0.28, 95% CI -0.41 to -0.15; RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.48), and long-term (SMD -0.35, 95% CI -0.46 to -0.24; RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.41); however, these significant benefits were not demonstrated into the very long-term (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.27). The results also demonstrated significantly greater improvement in anxiety outcomes for adults with anxiety treated with the collaborative care model in the short-term (SMD -0.30, 95% CI -0.44 to -0.17; RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.87), medium-term (SMD -0.33, 95% CI -0.47 to -0.19; RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.69), and long-term (SMD -0.20, 95% CI -0.34 to -0.06; RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.42); no comparisons examined the effects of the intervention on anxiety outcomes in the very long-term. There was evidence of benefit in secondary outcomes including medication use, mental health quality of life, and patient satisfaction, although there was less evidence of benefit in physical quality of life. Collaborative care is associated with significant improvement in depression and anxiety outcomes compared with usual care, and represents a useful addition to clinical pathways for adult patients with depression and anxiety.","Many people suffer from depression and anxiety, and these problems can make people feel sad, scared and even suicidal, and can affect their work, their relationships and their quality of life; depression and anxiety can occur because of personal, financial, social or health problems. Collaborative care is an innovative way of treating depression and anxiety and involves a number of health professionals working with a patient to help them overcome their problems; it often involves a medical doctor, a case manager (with training in depression and anxiety), and a mental health specialist such as a psychiatrist, with the case manager having regular contact with the person and organising care together with the medical doctor and specialist, and offering help with medication or access to a talking therapy to help the patient get better. Collaborative care has been tested with patients in a number of countries and health care systems, but it is not clear whether it should be recommended for people with depression or anxiety. In this review we found 79 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (90 comparisons) including 24,308 patients worldwide, comparing collaborative care with routine care or alternative treatments (such as consultation-liaison) for depression and anxiety; there were problems with the methods in some of the studies, for example, the methods used to allocate patients to collaborative care or routine care were not always free from bias, and many patients did not complete follow-up or provide information about their outcomes. Most of the studies focused on depression and the evidence suggests that collaborative care is better than routine care in improving depression for up to two years; a smaller number of studies examined the effect of collaborative care on anxiety and the evidence suggests that collaborative care is also better than usual care in improving anxiety for up to two years. Collaborative care increases the number of patients using medication in line with current guidance, and can improve mental health related quality of life, and patients with depression and anxiety treated with collaborative care are also more satisfied with their treatment.",1114,collaborative care; chronic disease management models; mental health problems; depression outcomes; anxiety outcomes; medication use; mental health quality of life; patient satisfaction; physical quality of life; clinical pathways,Why is there uncertainty about recommending collaborative care for depression and anxiety?,In what ways can collaborative care enhance the treatment of depression and anxiety?,Select the items that are animals,What are the common issues targeted by collaborative care?,How does collaborative care compare with routine care in managing depression?,The impact on very long-term outcomes is unclear.; The intervention is clearly less effective than routine care.; The number of health professionals involved makes it impractical.,The impact on very long-term outcomes is unclear.,By increasing the use of medication in line with guidelines.; By improving long-term physical quality of life.; By reducing the need for professional involvement.,By increasing the use of medication in line with guidelines.,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,Depression and anxiety; Cardiovascular diseases; Infectious diseases,Depression and anxiety,Collaborative care is better at improving depression outcomes; Routine care is more effective; Both have similar effects,Collaborative care is better at improving depression outcomes
66b01097e95b0626c2cd7b5c,static_2,Clopidogrel plus aspirin versus aspirin alone for preventing cardiovascular events,"Aspirin is the prophylactic antiplatelet drug of choice for people with cardiovascular disease. Adding a second antiplatelet drug to aspirin may produce additional benefit for people at high risk and people with established cardiovascular disease. This is an update to a previously published review from 2011.
To review the benefit and harm of adding clopidogrel to aspirin therapy for preventing cardiovascular events in people who have coronary disease, ischaemic cerebrovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, or were at high risk of atherothrombotic disease, but did not have a coronary stent. We updated the searches of CENTRAL (2017, Issue 6), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 4 July 2017) and Embase (Ovid, 1947 to 3 July 2017) on 4 July 2017. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP portal, and handsearched reference lists. We applied no language restrictions. We included all randomised controlled trials comparing over 30 days use of aspirin plus clopidogrel with aspirin plus placebo or aspirin alone in people with coronary disease, ischaemic cerebrovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, or at high risk of atherothrombotic disease. We excluded studies including only people with coronary drug-eluting stent (DES) or non-DES, or both. We collected data on mortality from cardiovascular causes, all-cause mortality, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction, fatal and non-fatal ischaemic stroke, major and minor bleeding. The overall treatment effect was estimated by the pooled risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI), using a fixed-effect model (Mantel-Haenszel); we used a random-effects model in cases of moderate or severe heterogeneity (I2=30%). We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We used GRADE profiler (GRADE Pro) to import data from Review Manager to create a 'Summary of findings' table. The search identified 13 studies in addition to the two studies in the previous version of our systematic review. Overall, we included data from 15 trials with 33,970 people. We completed a 'Risk of bias' assessment for all studies. The risk of bias was low in four trials because they were at low risk of bias for all key domains (random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, selective outcome reporting and incomplete outcome data), even if some of them were funded by the pharmaceutical industry. Analysis showed no difference in the effectiveness of aspirin plus clopidogrel in preventing cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.10; participants = 31,903; studies = 7; moderate quality evidence), and no evidence of a difference in all-cause mortality (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.25; participants = 32,908; studies = 9; low quality evidence). There was a lower risk of fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction with clopidogrel plus aspirin compared with aspirin plus placebo or aspirin alone (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.90; participants = 16,175; studies = 6; moderate quality evidence). There was a reduction in the risk of fatal and non-fatal ischaemic stroke (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.91; participants = 4006; studies = 5; moderate quality evidence). However, there was a higher risk of major bleeding with clopidogrel plus aspirin compared with aspirin plus placebo or aspirin alone (RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.64; participants = 33,300; studies = 10; moderate quality evidence) and of minor bleeding (RR 2.03, 95% CI 1.75 to 2.36; participants = 14,731; studies = 8; moderate quality evidence). Overall, we would expect 13 myocardial infarctions and 23 ischaemic strokes be prevented for every 1000 patients treated with the combination in a median follow-up period of 12 months, but 9 major bleeds and 33 minor bleeds would be caused during a median follow-up period of 10.5 and 6 months, respectively. The available evidence demonstrates that the use of clopidogrel plus aspirin in people at high risk of cardiovascular disease and people with established cardiovascular disease without a coronary stent is associated with a reduction in the risk of myocardial infarction and ischaemic stroke, and an increased risk of major and minor bleeding compared with aspirin alone. According to GRADE criteria, the quality of evidence was moderate for all outcomes except all-cause mortality (low quality evidence) and adverse events (very low quality evidence).","We reviewed the evidence about the effect of clopidogrel and aspirin in people at high risk of getting heart disease or having a stroke, and in those who already have heart disease. Aspirin is widely used to prevent heart disease, but the effects for people at high risk of getting heart disease are small. We wanted to find out whether taking clopidogrel (which is also used to prevent heart disease) and aspirin is better to prevent getting heart disease or having a stroke than taking aspirin alone. We also wanted to find out if people who already had heart disease were at less risk of dying, having a heart attack or stroke if they took clopidogrel and aspirin. This review contains evidence up to July 2017. We found 15 studies which together included more than 30,000 people at high risk of heart disease who are taking aspirin. All studies randomly assigned participants to the intervention group (taking aspirin and clopidogrel) or the control group (taking aspirin and placebo (a pretend treatment that has no effect). Participants took clopidogrel between six weeks and 3.4 years, depending on the study they took part in. The results do not apply to people with recent placement of coronary stents (tubes inserted in the blood vessel to keep it open), who were excluded from this review. The results showed that there is a benefit of adding clopidogrel to aspirin in terms of reducing the risk of heart attack or stroke. However, there is a higher risk of major and minor bleeding associated with this. There was no effect on death due to heart problems or death from any cause. Using Cochrane criteria, four trials were at low risk of bias. Using GRADE standards, the quality of published evidence was moderate for most results, but low for death from any cause and very low for side effects.",1068,antiplatelet drug; cardiovascular disease; coronary disease; ischaemic cerebrovascular disease; peripheral arterial disease; atherothrombotic disease; coronary stent; myocardial infarction; ischaemic stroke; major bleeding,What was the primary motivation for the study?,What outcome was observed with adding clopidogrel to aspirin?,Select all of the following that are colors,Which adverse effect was noted when combining clopidogrel with aspirin?,,To assess whether adding clopidogrel to aspirin reduces heart disease risk.; To examine the impact of aspirin on coronary stents.; To determine the best time to take aspirin daily.,To assess whether adding clopidogrel to aspirin reduces heart disease risk.,Reduced risk of heart attack or stroke.; Increased risk of coronary stent complications.; Enhanced performance in physical activities.,Reduced risk of heart attack or stroke.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Higher risk of major and minor bleeding.; Increased likelihood of headaches.; Lower risk of developing high blood pressure.,Higher risk of major and minor bleeding.,,
66b01097e95b0626c2cd7b5c,interactive_3,Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor agonists for acute stroke,"Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor agonists have been shown to have a neuroprotectant effect in reducing infarct size and improving functional outcome in animal models of cerebrovascular disease. However, the sedative effects of GABA receptor agonists have limited their wider application in people with acute stroke, due to the potential risk of stupor. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2013, and previously updated in 2014 and 2016. To determine the efficacy and safety of GABA receptor agonists in the treatment of acute stroke. We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (accessed May 2018), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) 2018, Issue 4 (accessed May 2018), MEDLINE (from 1949 to May 2018), Embase (from 1980 to May 2018), CINAHL (from 1982 to May 2018), AMED (from 1985 to May 2018), and 11 Chinese databases (accessed May 2018). In an effort to identify further published, unpublished, and ongoing trials we searched ongoing trial registers, reference lists, and relevant conference proceedings, and contacted authors and pharmaceutical companies. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating GABA receptor agonists versus placebo for people with acute stroke (within 12 hours after stroke onset), with the primary outcomes of efficacy and safety. Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of identified records, selected studies for inclusion, extracted eligible data, cross-checked the data for accuracy, and assessed the risk of bias. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence. We included five trials with 3838 participants (acute ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke patients, 3758 analyzed). Most of the participants recruited had acute ischaemic stroke, with limited data available from participants with other stroke subtypes, including total anterior circulation syndrome (TACS). The methodological quality of the included trials was generally good, with an unclear risk for selection bias only. For death and dependency at three months, pooled results did not find a significant difference for chlormethiazole versus placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96 to 1.11; four trials; 2909 participants; moderate-quality evidence) and for diazepam versus placebo (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.07; one trial; 849 participants; moderate-quality evidence). The most frequent adverse events related to chlormethiazole were somnolence (RR 4.56, 95% CI 3.50 to 5.95; two trials; 2527 participants; moderate-quality evidence) and rhinitis (RR 4.75, 95% CI 2.67 to 8.46; two trials; 2527 participants; moderate-quality evidence). This review provides moderate-quality evidence that fails to support the use of GABA receptor agonists (chlormethiazole or diazepam) for the treatment of people with acute stroke. More well-designed RCTs with large samples of participants with total anterior circulation syndrome are required to determine if there are benefits for this subgroup. Somnolence and rhinitis are frequent adverse events related to chlormethiazole.","Background : GABA receptor agonists are a type of drug that may help protect the brain in acute stroke. This group of drugs, which includes diazepam and chlormethiazole, has been used as traditional sedatives for several decades, and have been found to be beneficial in stroke studies in animals. However, the sedative effect of GABA receptor agonists could be harmful for people with acute stroke. Study characteristics : We identified five studies to May 2018 that met our inclusion criteria; they randomized 3838 participants (acute ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke patients) and analyzed 3758. The quality of all the studies was generally good, with a low risk of bias. One study tested the effects and safety of diazepam for acute stroke in 849 participants within 12 hours of stroke onset. Four studies tested the effects and safety of chlormethiazole in 2909 participants with acute stroke, within 12 hours of stroke onset; 95 participants had stroke caused by bleeding and were analyzed separately. Key results : All five trials reported death and dependency at three months. There was no significant difference between the chlormethiazole and placebo groups or between the diazepam and placebo groups. The most frequent side effects caused by chlormethiazole were drowsiness and nasal irritation.

66b01097e95b0626c2cd7b5c,interactive_4,Is molnupiravir (an antiviral medicine) safe and effective in treating people with COVID-19?,"To assess the effects of molnupiravir in people with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and mild to moderate symptoms. We identified all relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) by searching the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, Science Citation Index Expanded, the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Literature on Coronavirus Disease database, and the COVID Network Meta-Analysis database with no language restrictions up to 26 April 2024. In outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19, molnupiravir 800 mg taken orally every 12 hours for five days probably results in little to no difference in all-cause mortality and may result in little to no difference in rates of hospitalisation and symptom resolution. There is evidence of increased viral clearance by day 5, but the clinical relevance of this finding is unclear. There is probably little to no difference in adverse events, and there is little to no difference in serious adverse events, with molnupiravir versus placebo or standard care. Inpatient data are lacking, and there is no evidence of benefit of molnupiravir in this population. Further research involving inpatients may change this.","Molnupiravir is a pill used to treat COVID-19 in people who are at high risk of developing severe illness. It works by interfering with the ability of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) to reproduce, helping the body to fight off the infection. We wanted to find out how molnupiravir compares to no treatment, placebo (dummy treatment), or standard of care in decreasing death and hospitalisation in people with COVID-19; speeding up recovery (time to symptom resolution); clearing the virus that causes COVID-19 (viral clearance); safety, by looking at all unwanted events and serious unwanted events. We searched for studies that evaluated molnupiravir compared with no treatment, placebo, or standard of care in people with confirmed COVID-19. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods. The types of studies we looked at were randomised controlled trials, which assign people randomly to two or more treatment groups. This is the best way to ensure that study groups are similar, and that investigators and participants don't know who is in which group. The review included 11 studies with 31,272 participants, mostly outpatients (people not admitted to hospital) with mild to moderate COVID-19. When we combined results from studies that recruited outpatients (people not admitted to hospital) with mild to moderate COVID-19, we found the following key results: Molnupiravir probably results in little to no difference in the risk of death. Compared with people receiving placebo or standard of care, between four and 10 fewer people receiving molnupiravir will die within one month for every 10,000 people treated. We considered this reduction clinically insignificant. Molnupiravir may not reduce hospitalisations, meaning it may not prevent people from getting sicker or needing hospital care. There was evidence of increased viral clearance with molnupiravir by day 5, but this effect diminished by day 14, and we are not sure if it makes any real difference for patients. Molnupiravir may have little to no effect on the probability of having no symptoms by day 14 or day 28. Molnupiravir probably results in little to no difference in adverse events, and results in little to no difference in serious adverse events. There are too few data to draw clear conclusions about molnupiravir's effects in people admitted to hospital with severe COVID-19. Most evidence comes from studies conducted in outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19, so the results may not apply to people with severe illness who are hospitalised. The studies provided scarce evidence on long-term outcomes such as quality of life after recovery or how long the virus stays in the body. We were unable to analyse whether molnupiravir had a different effect in certain groups of people, like those with severe pre-existing conditions or people from low- or middle-income countries.",1106,molnupiravir; SARS-CoV-2; mild to moderate COVID-19; all-cause mortality; symptom resolution; viral clearance; clinical relevance; adverse events,What reasoning could justify the conclusion that molnupiravir has little effect on hospitalisations in mild COVID-19 cases?,How might the design of future studies be improved to better assess molnupiravir's effectiveness in severe COVID-19 cases?,Select the items that are animals,What conclusions might be drawn from the evidence of increased viral clearance by day 5 with no significant impact on symptoms?,What challenges could arise in interpreting the clinical relevance of viral clearance associated with molnupiravir?,No significant difference in hospitalisation rates compared to placebo; Possible misinterpretation of viral clearance as recovery; Bias introduced by non-randomized study designs,No significant difference in hospitalisation rates compared to placebo,Including a larger sample of hospitalised patients; Excluding all outpatients to reduce variability; Focusing on participants from higher-income countries,Including a larger sample of hospitalised patients,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,Viral clearance may not correlate directly with clinical outcomes; The study possibly had errors in measuring viral load; Molnupiravir has a durable effect lasting beyond day 5,Viral clearance may not correlate directly with clinical outcomes,Lack of alignment between viral clearance and patient recovery; Overstated results from non-peer-reviewed studies; Underrepresentation of severe cases in the data,Lack of alignment between viral clearance and patient recovery
66b01097e95b0626c2cd7b5c,interactive_4,Interventions to prevent or reduce kidney complications in people with sickle cell disease,"Sickle cell disease (SCD), one of the commonest severe monogenic disorders, is caused by the inheritance of two abnormal haemoglobin (beta-globin) genes. SCD can cause severe pain, significant end-organ damage, pulmonary complications, and premature death. Kidney disease is a frequent and potentially severe complication in people with SCD. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined as abnormalities of kidney structure or function present for more than three months. Sickle cell nephropathy refers to the spectrum of kidney complications in SCD. Glomerular damage is a cause of microalbuminuria and can develop at an early age in children with SCD, with increased prevalence in adulthood. In people with sickle cell nephropathy, outcomes are poor as a result of the progression to proteinuria and chronic kidney insufficiency. Up to 12% of people who develop sickle cell nephropathy will develop end-stage renal disease. This is an update of a review first published in 2017. To assess the effectiveness of any intervention for preventing or reducing kidney complications or chronic kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease. Possible interventions include red blood cell transfusions, hydroxyurea, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), either alone or in combination. We searched for relevant trials in the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, seven other databases, and two other trials registers. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing interventions to prevent or reduce kidney complications or CKD in people with SCD. We applied no restrictions related to outcomes examined, language, or publication status. Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility, extracted data, assessed the risk of bias, and assessed the certainty of the evidence (GRADE). We included three RCTs with 385 participants. We rated the certainty of the evidence as low to very low across different outcomes according to GRADE methodology, downgrading for risk of bias concerns, indirectness, and imprecision. Hydroxyurea versus placebo One RCT published in 2011 compared hydroxyurea to placebo in 193 children aged nine to 18 months. We are unsure if hydroxyurea compared to placebo reduces or prevents progression of kidney disease assessed by change in glomerular filtration rate (mean difference (MD) 0.58 mL/min /1.73 m2, 95% confidence interval (CI) -14.60 to 15.76; 142 participants; very low certainty). Hydroxyurea compared to placebo may improve the ability to concentrate urine (MD 42.23 mOsm/kg, 95% CI 12.14 to 72.32; 178 participants; low certainty), and may make little or no difference to SCD-related serious adverse events, including acute chest syndrome (risk ratio (RR) 0.39, 99% CI 0.13 to 1.16; 193 participants; low certainty), painful crisis (RR 0.68, 99% CI 0.45 to 1.02; 193 participants; low certainty); and hospitalisations (RR 0.83, 99% CI 0.68 to 1.01; 193 participants; low certainty). No deaths occurred in either trial arm and the RCT did not report quality of life. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors versus placebo One RCT published in 1998 compared an ACEI (captopril) to placebo in 22 adults with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. We are unsure if captopril compared to placebo reduces proteinuria (MD -124.10 to 26.10; 22 participants; very low certainty). We are unsure if captopril reduces or prevents kidney disease as measured by creatinine clearance; the trial authors stated that creatinine clearance remained constant over six months in both groups, but provided no comparative data (very low certainty). The RCT did not report serious adverse events, all-cause mortality, or quality of life. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors versus vitamin C One RCT published in 2020 compared an ACEI (lisinopril)with vitamin C in 170 children aged one to 18 years with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. It reported no data we could analyse. We are unsure if lisinopril compared to vitamin C reduces proteinuria in this population: the large drop in microalbuminuria in both arms of the trial after only one month on treatment may have been due to an overestimation of microalbuminuria at baseline rather than a true effect. The RCT did not report serious adverse events, all-cause mortality, or quality of life. We are unsure if hydroxyurea improves glomerular filtration rate or reduces hyperfiltration in children aged nine to 18 months, but it may improve their ability to concentrate urine and may make little or no difference to the incidence of acute chest syndrome, painful crises, and hospitalisations. We are unsure if ACEI compared to placebo has any effect on preventing or reducing kidney complications in adults with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. We are unsure if ACEI compared to vitamin C has any effect on preventing or reducing kidney complications in children with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. No RCTs assessed red blood cell transfusions or any combined interventions to prevent or reduce kidney complications. Due to lack of evidence, we cannot comment on the management of children aged over 18 months or adults with any known genotype of SCD. We have identified a lack of adequately designed and powered studies, although we found four ongoing trials since the last version of this review. Only one ongoing trial addresses renal function as a primary outcome in the short term, but such interventions have long-term effects. Trials of hydroxyurea, ACEIs or red blood cell transfusion in older children and adults are urgently needed to determine any effect on prevention or reduction of kidney complications in people with SCD.","SCD is a serious inherited blood disorder where the red blood cells, which carry oxygen around the body, develop abnormally. Normal red blood cells are flexible and disc-shaped, but sickled cells are rigid and crescent-shaped, and stickier than normal red blood cells. This can lead to blockage of blood vessels, resulting in tissue and organ damage and episodes of severe pain. The abnormal cells are fragile and break apart easily, which leads to a decreased number of red blood cells, known as anaemia.Kidney complications can start at an early age in children with SCD and are common in adults with the condition. Kidney complications leading to kidney protein leak and chronic kidney disease can be severe, with serious effects on health. Severe complications include the need for dialysis (a procedure to remove waste products and excess fluid from the blood when the kidneys stop working properly) or a kidney transplant. Identifying therapies that can prevent or slow down the decline in kidney function in people with SCD is critical for improving health outcomes. The evidence is current to 22 September 2022. We found three randomised controlled trials, which enroled a total of 385 people. One trial, published in 2011, compared the drug hydroxyurea (which helps to maintain the shape and flexibility of red blood cells), to placebo (dummy treatment) in 193 children aged nine to 18 months. The second trial, published in 1998, compared captopril (a drug used to treat high blood pressure) to placebo in 22 adults with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria (high levels of protein in the urine). The third trial, published in 2020, compared lisinopril (a drug used to treat high blood pressure) to vitamin C in 170 children aged one to 18 years. Two trials received government funding; it was unclear how the third trial was funded. We have little or very little confidence in the evidence because we only found three trials, and they had specific populations (only children or only adults), few participants, and wide variations in results.",1089,Sickle cell disease; monogenic disorders; haemoglobin; chronic kidney disease; sickle cell nephropathy; microalbuminuria; end-stage renal disease; glomerular filtration rate; acute chest syndrome; painful crisis,What condition does sickle cell disease primarily affect?,Identify a key characteristic of red blood cells in people with SCD.,Select the items that are animals,What is the main purpose of the reviewed trials in the study?,What serious kidney complication can arise from SCD?,Red blood cells; White blood cells; Blood platelets,Red blood cells,Flexible and disc-shaped; Rigid and crescent-shaped; Irregular and square-shaped,Rigid and crescent-shaped,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,To prevent kidney protein leak; To slow kidney function decline; To cure SCD,To slow kidney function decline,Kidney stones; Need for dialysis or kidney transplant; Urinary tract infections,Need for dialysis or kidney transplant
66b01097e95b0626c2cd7b5c,finetuned_5,Long-term treatment for people with persistent depression,"Persistent depressive disorder (PDD) is defined as a depressive disorder with a minimum illness duration of two years, including four diagnostic subgroups (dysthymia, chronic major depression, recurrent major depression with incomplete remission between episodes, and double depression), and persistent forms of depression represent a substantial proportion of depressive disorders, with a lifetime prevalence ranging from 3% to 6% in the Western world; growing evidence indicates that PDD responds well to several acute interventions, such as combined psychological and pharmacological treatments, yet given the high rates of relapse and recurrences of depression following response to acute treatment, long-term continuation and maintenance therapy are of great importance, and to date there has been no evidence synthesis available on continuation and maintenance treatments of PDDs. The aim of this review was to assess the effects of pharmacological and psychological (either alone or combined) continuation and maintenance treatments for persistent depressive disorder, in comparison with each other, placebo (drug/attention placebo/non-specific treatment control), and treatment as usual (TAU), with continuation treatments defined as treatments given to currently remitted people (remission is defined as depressive symptoms dropping below case level) or to people who previously responded to an antidepressant treatment, and maintenance therapy given during recovery (defined as remission lasting longer than six months). We searched Ovid MEDLINE (1950- ), Embase (1974- ), PsycINFO (1967- ) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to 28 September 2018, with an earlier search of these databases also conducted via the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trial Register (CCMD-CTR) to 11 December 2015; in addition we searched grey literature resources, ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP to 28 September 2018, screened reference lists of included studies, and contacted the first author of included studies. We included randomized (RCTs) and non-randomized controlled trials (NRCTs) in adults with formally diagnosed PDD, receiving pharmacological, psychological, or combined continuation and maintenance interventions. Two review authors independently selected studies and extracted and analyzed data; the primary efficacy outcome was relapse/recurrence rate of depression, and the primary acceptance outcome was dropout due to any reason other than relapse/recurrence; we performed random-effects meta-analyses using risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We included 10 studies (seven RCTs, three NRCTs) involving 840 participants, with five studies investigating continuation treatments and five investigating maintenance treatments; overall, the included studies were at low-to-moderate risk of bias, with the most common source of risk of bias in NRCTs being selection of reported results, and in RCTs non-blinding of outcome assessment and other bias (especially conflict of interest due to pharmaceutical sponsoring). The most common comparison was antidepressant medication versus tablet placebo (five studies), and participants taking antidepressant medication were probably less likely to relapse or to experience a recurrent episode compared to participants in the placebo group at the end of the intervention (13.9% versus 33.8%, RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.79; participants = 383; studies = 4;  I²  = 54%, moderate quality evidence); overall dropout rates may be similar between participants in the medication and placebo group (23.0% versus 25.5%, RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.39 to 2.11; RCTs = 4; participants = 386;  I²  = 64%, low quality evidence), although sensitivity analyses showed that the primary outcome (rate of relapse/recurrence) showed no evidence of a difference between groups when only including studies with low risk of bias. None of the studies compared pharmacological or psychological treatments versus TAU. One study compared psychological therapies versus attention placebo/non-specific control, and one study compared psychotherapy with medication; the results of the studies including psychotherapy might indicate that continued or maintained psychotherapy could be a useful intervention compared to no treatment or antidepressant medication, but the body of evidence for these comparisons was too small and uncertain to draw high quality conclusions. Three studies compared combined psychological and pharmacological therapies with pharmacological therapies alone, and one study compared combined psychological and pharmacological therapies with psychotherapeutic therapies alone; however, the evidence was too small and uncertain to draw any high quality conclusions. Two studies reported data on the direct comparison of two antidepressants, but again the evidence was too small and uncertain to draw conclusions. Currently, it is uncertain whether continued or maintained pharmacotherapy (or both) with the reviewed antidepressant agents is a robust treatment for preventing relapse and recurrence in people with PDD due to moderate or high risk of bias as well as clinical heterogeneity in the analyzed studies; for all other comparisons, the body of evidence was too small to draw any final conclusions, although continued or maintained psychotherapy might be effective compared to no treatment. There is a need for more high quality trials of psychological interventions, and further studies should address health-related quality of life and adverse events more precisely, as well as assessing follow-up data.","Depressive disorders that persist for at least two years cause considerable problems; even after successful treatment, they frequently recur, and common treatments are antidepressant medicines and psychological treatments (talking therapies), or a combination of both, with long-term treatments intended to prevent the recurrence of depressive symptoms. People with persisting depression (longer than two years), friends, families, and carers, as well as general practitioners, psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, psychological therapists, and pharmacists, will be interested in this review. In adults with persistent depression who improved with acute (short-term) treatment, the review aimed to determine whether receiving continued antidepressant medicine, psychological treatment, or a combination of both is more effective in preventing recurrence of depression compared to placebo (a pretended treatment) or care as usual; whether receiving continued antidepressant medicine, psychological treatment, or a combination of both is equally accepted as receiving placebo or usual care; and whether one treatment is more effective or more accepted than another. We searched medical databases and other sources to find all relevant studies completed up to September 2018, and the studies had to compare antidepressant treatment, psychological treatment, or a combination of both, with each other, with placebo, or with care as usual for preventing recurrence of depression in adults diagnosed with persistent depression; we included 10 studies involving 840 participants. Five studies compared antidepressant medicine with placebo; one study compared psychological therapies versus attention placebo/non-specific control; one study compared psychotherapy with medication; three studies compared combined psychological and pharmacological therapies with pharmacological therapies alone; one study compared combined psychological and pharmacological therapies with psychotherapeutic therapies alone; and two studies compared two different antidepressants with each other. Overall, the included studies were at low-to-moderate risk of bias. According to GRADE, there was moderate quality evidence that participants taking medication treatment probably had less relapses/recurrences and may have lower dropouts than those taking placebo; the risk of depression returning in participants receiving a placebo (instead of antidepressant medicine) was 34%, whereas participants who remained on antidepressant medicines had a lower risk for recurrence of 13%, with continued treatment lasting between four months and two years. Antidepressants were as well accepted as placebo; however, as most of the included studies showed risk of bias and there were some inconsistent results between the different studies, it cannot be concluded with certainty whether continued or maintained pharmacotherapy (or both) is a convincing treatment for people with PDD. Additionally, as studies on the long-term effects of medication are lacking, recommendations on the necessary duration of medication treatment cannot be drawn. The benefits of psychological therapies or combined treatment remained unclear due to the small number of studies. This review cannot provide clear, certain evidence regarding whether continued antidepressant medication (compared to placebo tablet) reduces the risk of depression recurring in adults with persistent depression; however, only a few studies have been done, and further studies should especially address psychological and combined long-term treatments.",1116,Persistent depressive disorder; acute interventions; remission; continuation and maintenance therapy; psychotherapy,What might be the implications of the study's findings for the long-term management of persistent depressive disorder (PDD)?,What is the primary focus of the study?,Select all of the following that are fruits,Which treatments were compared in the study?,How are long-term treatments intended to benefit patients with persistent depression?,Continued antidepressant medication offers a definitive solution to prevent recurrence.; Psychotherapy could potentially be more effective but requires further research.; There is uncertainty regarding the efficacy of combined treatments due to limited data.,Psychotherapy could potentially be more effective but requires further research.; There is uncertainty regarding the efficacy of combined treatments due to limited data.,Assessing continuation and maintenance treatments for persistent depression; Investigating new antidepressant medications; Studying short-term interventions for depression,Assessing continuation and maintenance treatments for persistent depression,dog; blue; grape,grape,Antidepressant medications versus placebo; Psychological therapies versus attention placebo; Lifestyle interventions versus exercise,Antidepressant medications versus placebo; Psychological therapies versus attention placebo,Preventing recurrence of depressive symptoms; Eliminating depressive symptoms completely; Providing immediate relief from symptoms,Preventing recurrence of depressive symptoms
66b01097e95b0626c2cd7b5c,finetuned_6,What are the benefits and harms of remote ischaemic conditioning (briefly restricting then restoring blood flow) for preventing and treating stroke?,"Remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) has been developed as a neuroprotective strategy to prevent and treat ischaemic stroke. It usually involves restricting blood flow to limbs and then releasing the ischaemic blood to promote a neuroprotective effect. Preclinical studies have suggested that RIC may have beneficial effects in ischaemic stroke patients and those at risk of ischaemic stroke. However, existing evidence is insufficient to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of RIC in preventing and treating ischaemic stroke. To evaluate the benefits and harms of remote ischaemic conditioning in preventing and treating ischaemic stroke compared to sham or standard treatments. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, three Chinese databases, five trials registers, and conference proceedings, together with reference checking and citation searching. The latest search date was 11 March 2025. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing RIC with sham RIC or medical management in people with ischaemic stroke or at risk of ischaemic stroke. Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed trial quality and risk of bias, and extracted data. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence. We included seven trials, involving 735 participants, in this review. We analysed the effects of RIC on preventing and treating ischaemic stroke respectively. We evaluated risk of bias and judged it to be low for generation of allocation sequence in six studies and unclear in one study; unclear for allocation concealment in four studies and low in three studies; high for incomplete outcome data (attrition bias) in five studies and low in two studies; high for blinding in three studies and low in four studies; low for selective reporting; and high for other sources of bias in six studies and low in one study. We included three trials (involving 371 participants) in the analysis of the effects of RIC on ischaemic stroke prevention. In people with symptomatic intracerebral artery stenosis, recurrent stroke was significantly reduced by RIC (risk ratio (RR) 0.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12 to 0.83; 2 trials, 182 participants, low-quality evidence). In people with carotid stenosis undergoing carotid stenting, there was no significant difference in the incidence of ischaemic stroke between participants treated with RIC and non-RIC (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.03; 1 trial, 189 participants, low-quality evidence); however the stroke severity (assessed by infarct volume) was significantly lower in participants treated with RIC (mean difference (MD) -0.17 mL, 95% CI -0.23 to -0.11; 1 trial, 189 participants, low-quality evidence). Adverse events associated with RIC were significantly higher in participants treated with RIC (RR 10.91; 95% CI 2.01 to 59.28; 3 trials, 371 participants, low-quality evidence), but no severe adverse event was attributable to RIC treatment. No participants experienced death or cardiovascular events during the period of the studies; and no trial reported haemorrhagic stroke or improvement in neurological, phycological or cognitive impairment. We included four trials (involving 364 participants) in the analysis of the effects of RIC on ischaemic stroke treatment. In acute ischaemic stroke, for people receiving intravenous thrombolysis, the rate of death or dependency was significantly increased by RIC treatment compared with non-RIC treatment (RR 2.34; 95% 1.19 to 4.61; 1 trial, 285 participants, low-quality evidence). In people with acute ischaemic stroke, there was no significant difference between RIC and non-RIC for reducing stroke severity as assessed by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score and the final infarct volume (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.24 mL, 95% CI -1.02 to 0.54; 2 trials, 175 participants, very low quality evidence). There was no significant difference between RIC and non-RIC for improving the psychological impairment (SMD -0.37 points, 95% CI -1.15 to 0.41; 1 trial, 26 participants, very low quality evidence) and the cognitive impairment (SMD -0.26 points; 95% CI -0.72 to 0.21; 3 trials, 79 participants, low-quality evidence) in people with acute ischaemic stroke and cerebral small vessel disease. No trial reported ischaemic stroke, recurrent ischaemic stroke, improvement in neurological impairment, hemorrhagic stroke, cardiovascular events, and RIC associated adverse events. There is moderate-certainty evidence that RIC compared to non-RIC probably reduces recurrence of ischaemic stroke slightly, and low-certainty evidence that RIC may result in a slight increase in excellent functional outcome (mRS 0 to 1). Evidence for improvement in NIHSS scores is very uncertain due to risk of bias and imprecision. RIC demonstrated an acceptable harm profile with no increase in intracerebral haemorrhage or mortality; however, treatment-related adverse events were more common. The certainty of evidence was limited by high risk of bias for blinding in most studies, incomplete outcome data in some studies, and imprecision in several outcomes. However, the generalisability of these findings may be limited because 79.3% of participants were from China, highlighting the need for further studies in diverse populations to confirm the results. The optimal timing, duration, and method of RIC administration require further investigation through large, high-quality randomised trials with standardised protocols to establish definitive evidence for clinical practice. This updated analysis includes 16 new RCTs, and these findings highlight the need for ongoing research and careful consideration of study design and methodology in future investigations.","Ischaemic stroke is the most common type of stroke. It occurs when a blood clot blocks an artery that supplies blood to the brain. This blockage cuts off the supply of oxygen and nutrients to a part of the brain. Without this blood supply, brain cells in that area are damaged and begin to die. Remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) involves briefly and repeatedly restricting and then restoring blood flow in a limb (an arm or leg) with a blood pressure cuff. The goal is to ""condition"" the limb and trigger the body's natural defences to protect other organs. Studies have found that for people who have had a stroke and are receiving standard medical care, adding RIC can reduce the amount of brain tissue damaged by the stroke, improve recovery of everyday functions, help prevent another stroke from happening, and reduce problems with memory and thinking.
We wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of RIC in people who have had an ischaemic stroke and are undergoing various treatments, including standard medical therapy, intravenous thrombolysis (a clot-dissolving treatment), or mechanical thrombectomy (a procedure to remove clots). Specifically, we wanted to know if RIC was better than sham or standard treatment for improving:
- the risk of dying;
- the risk of having another stroke;
- the likelihood of an excellent recovery (a score on the Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) of 0 to 1);
- the likelihood of being able to live independently (mRS score of 0 to 2);
- the risk of a brain bleed;
- brain function issues;
- the risk of major heart problems.
We also wanted to know if RIC has unwanted effects.
We searched for studies that compared the benefits and harms of remote ischaemic conditioning in people with ischaemic stroke. We then compared and summarised the study results and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and sample sizes.
We found 21 studies with 7687 people. The studies took place in China, Denmark, France, the UK, and Romania, and were published between 2012 and 2025.
Sixteen studies including 6828 participants suggested that RIC compared to sham or no treatment probably leads to a slight reduction in the risk of having another stroke. About half the studies measured participants' level of independence using the mRS and measured change in brain function issues using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). RIC might lead to a slight increase in the number of people achieving an excellent recovery, but may have little or no effect on the number of people being able to live independently. In addition, RIC might result in a slight improvement in brain function issues, but the evidence is very uncertain. There may be little or no difference between RIC and sham or standard treatment in the risk of a brain bleed and major heart problems, and RIC probably does not increase the risk of death. However, RIC may have unwanted effects such as arm pain, redness, or swelling.
We also identified 21 ongoing studies that we plan to add to the next version of our review.
Our confidence in the evidence is moderate to very low for several reasons. Most studies had few participants, and more than half of studies were done in China, which means the results of our review may not apply to people in other parts of the world. Some studies included people who received clot-dissolving treatment (thrombolysis) and people who did not, and we could not separate the results for these two groups. This mix of patients may have affected our overall analysis. Finally, we did not separate the results in our analysis based on the type of comparison group used (sham or standard treatment). This means it is difficult to know if the treatment effect we found was influenced by the type of comparison.",1069,Ischaemic stroke; Remote ischaemic conditioning; Neuroprotective effect; Symptomatic intracerebral artery stenosis; Carotid stenosis; Intravenous thrombolysis; Infarct volume; National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale; Carotid stenting,What is the primary goal of remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) mentioned in the summary?,What effects of RIC on brain function issues were summarized?,Select the items that are animals,How does RIC compare to sham or standard treatment in terms of stroke recurrence risk?,What was evaluated alongside the benefits of RIC in the summary?,To dissolve existing blood clots in the brain.; To trigger the body's natural defenses to protect other organs.; To permanently restrict blood flow to limbs.,To trigger the body's natural defenses to protect other organs.,RIC might result in a slight improvement in brain function issues.; RIC causes significant decline in cognitive function.; RIC has no impact on brain function issues.,RIC might result in a slight improvement in brain function issues.,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,RIC probably leads to a slight reduction in the risk of having another stroke.; RIC significantly increases the risk of recurrent stroke.; RIC has no effect on stroke recurrence risk.,RIC probably leads to a slight reduction in the risk of having another stroke.,The harms of RIC were also evaluated.; Only the economic cost of RIC was evaluated.; RIC's compatibility with other conditions was evaluated.,The harms of RIC were also evaluated.
66b01097e95b0626c2cd7b5c,finetuned_6,Low-carbohydrate diets or balanced-carbohydrate diets: which works better for weight loss and heart disease risks?,"Debates on effective and safe diets for managing obesity in adults are ongoing. Low-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets (also known as 'low-carb diets') continue to be widely promoted, marketed and commercialised as being more effective for weight loss, and healthier, than 'balanced'-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets. To compare the effects of low-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets to weight-reducing diets with balanced ranges of carbohydrates, in relation to changes in weight and cardiovascular risk, in overweight and obese adults without and with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We searched MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase (Ovid), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Web of Science Core Collection (Clarivate Analytics), ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to 25 June 2021, and screened reference lists of included trials and relevant systematic reviews. Language or publication restrictions were not applied. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in adults (18 years+) who were overweight or living with obesity, without or with T2DM, and without or with cardiovascular conditions or risk factors. Trials had to compare low-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets to balanced-carbohydrate (45% to 65% of total energy (TE)) weight-reducing diets, have a weight-reducing phase of 2 weeks or longer and be explicitly implemented for the primary purpose of reducing weight, with or without advice to restrict energy intake. Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts and full?text articles to determine eligibility; and independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias using RoB 2 and assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. We stratified analyses by participants without and with T2DM, and by diets with weight-reducing phases only and those with weight-reducing phases followed by weight-maintenance phases. Primary outcomes were change in body weight (kg) and the number of participants per group with weight loss of at least 5%, assessed at short- (three months to < 12 months) and long-term (? 12 months) follow-up. We included 61 parallel-arm RCTs that randomised 6925 participants to either low-carbohydrate or balanced-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets. All trials were conducted in high-income countries except for one in China. Most participants (n = 5118 randomised) did not have T2DM. Mean baseline weight across trials was 95 kg (range 66 to 132 kg). Participants with T2DM were older (mean 57 years, range 50 to 65) than those without T2DM (mean 45 years, range 22 to 62). Most trials included men and women (42/61; 3/19 men only; 16/19 women only), and people without baseline cardiovascular conditions, risk factors or events (36/61). Mean baseline diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol across trials were within normal ranges. The longest weight-reducing phase of diets was two years in participants without and with T2DM. Evidence from studies with weight-reducing phases followed by weight-maintenance phases was limited. Most trials investigated low-carbohydrate diets (> 50 g to 150 g per day or < 45% of TE; n = 42), followed by very low (? 50 g per day or < 10% of TE; n = 14), and then incremental increases from very low to low (n = 5). The most common diets compared were low-carbohydrate, balanced-fat (20 to 35% of TE) and high-protein (> 20% of TE) treatment diets versus control diets balanced for the three macronutrients (24/61). In most trials (45/61) the energy prescription or approach used to restrict energy intake was similar in both groups. We assessed the overall risk of bias of outcomes across trials as predominantly high, mostly from bias due to missing outcome data. Using GRADE, we assessed the certainty of evidence as moderate to very low across outcomes. Participants without and with T2DM lost weight when following weight-reducing phases of both diets at the short (range: 12.2 to 0.33 kg) and long term (range: 13.1 to 1.7 kg). In overweight and obese participants without T2DM: low-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets compared to balanced-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets (weight-reducing phases only) probably result in little to no difference in change in body weight over three to 8.5 months (mean difference (MD) ?1.07 kg, (95% confidence interval (CI) ?1.55 to ?0.59, I2 = 51%, 3286 participants, 37 RCTs, moderate-certainty evidence) and over one to two years (MD ?0.93 kg, 95% CI ?1.81 to ?0.04, I2 = 40%, 1805 participants, 14 RCTs, moderate-certainty evidence); as well as change in DBP and LDL cholesterol over one to two years. The evidence is very uncertain about whether there is a difference in the number of participants per group with weight loss of at least 5% at one year (risk ratio (RR) 1.11, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.31, I2 = 17%, 137 participants, 2 RCTs, very low-certainty evidence). In overweight and obese participants with T2DM: low-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets compared to balanced-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets (weight-reducing phases only) probably result in little to no difference in change in body weight over three to six months (MD ?1.26 kg, 95% CI ?2.44 to ?0.09, I2 = 47%, 1114 participants, 14 RCTs, moderate-certainty evidence) and over one to two years (MD ?0.33 kg, 95% CI ?2.13 to 1.46, I2 = 10%, 813 participants, 7 RCTs, moderate-certainty evidence); as well in change in DBP, HbA1c and LDL cholesterol over 1 to 2 years. The evidence is very uncertain about whether there is a difference in the number of participants per group with weight loss of at least 5% at one to two years (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.20, I2 = 0%, 106 participants, 2 RCTs, very low-certainty evidence). Evidence on participant-reported adverse effects was limited, and we could not draw any conclusions about these. There is probably little to no difference in weight reduction and changes in cardiovascular risk factors up to two years' follow-up, when overweight and obese participants without and with T2DM are randomised to either low-carbohydrate or balanced-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets.","What are low-carbohydrate and balanced-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets? People spend lots of money on trying to lose weight using diets, products, foods and books, and continue to debate about which diets are effective and safe. So, examining the scientific evidence behind claims made is important. Low-carbohydrate diets are a broad category of weight-reducing diets that manipulate and restrict carbohydrates, protein and fat in diets. There are no consistent, widely-accepted definitions of these diets and different descriptions are used (such as, 'low-carbohydrate, high-protein, 'low-carbohydrate, high-fat', or very low-carbohydrate). Low-carbohydrate diets are implemented in different ways, but they restrict grains, cereals and legumes, and other carbohydrate-containing foods; such as dairy, most fruit and certain vegetables. These foods are then typically replaced with foods higher in fat and protein; such as meats, eggs, cheese, butter, cream, oils. Some low-carbohydrate diets recommend eating as desired, while others recommend restricting the amount of energy eaten. Balanced-carbohydrate diets contain more moderate amounts of carbohydrates, protein and fats, in line with current healthy eating advice from health authorities. When used for weight reduction, balanced diets recommend restricting the amount of energy eaten by guiding people to reduce their portion sizes and choose healthier foods (e.g. lean instead of fatty meat). Low-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets are widely promoted, marketed and commercialised as being more effective for weight loss, and healthier, than 'balanced'-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets. What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out if low-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets were better for weight loss and heart disease risk factors than balanced-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets in adults who were overweight or living with obesity. We wanted to find this out for people with and without type 2 diabetes. What did we do? We searched six electronic databases and trial registries for all trials* that compared low-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets with balanced-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets in adults who were overweight or living with obesity. The trials had to last for at least three months. We compared and summarised the results of the trials and rated our confidence in the combined evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. *A trial is a type of study in which participants are assigned randomly to two or more treatment groups. This is the best way to ensure similar groups of participants. What did we find? We found 61 trials involving 6925 people who were overweight or living with obesity. The biggest trial was in 419 people and the smallest was in 20 people. All except one of the trials were conducted in high-income countries worldwide, and nearly half were undertaken in the USA (26). Most trials (36) were undertaken in people who did not have heart disease or risk factors. Most people (5118 people) did not have type 2 diabetes. The average starting weight of people across the trials was 95 kg. Most studies (37) lasted for six months or less; and the longest studies (6) lasted for two years. Main results Low-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets probably result in little to no difference in weight loss over the short term (trials lasting 3 to 8.5 months) and long term (trials lasting one to two years) compared to balanced-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets, in people with and without type 2 diabetes. In the short term, the average difference in weight loss was about 1 kg and in the long term, the average difference was less than 1 kg. People lost weight on both diets in some trials. The amount of weight lost on average varied greatly with both diets across the trials from less than 1 kg in some trials and up to about 12 kg in others in the short term and long term. Similarly, low-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets probably result in little to no difference in diastolic blood pressure, glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and LDL cholesterol (unhealthy cholesterol) for up to two years. We could not draw any conclusions about unwanted effects reported by participants because very few trials reported these. What are the limitations of the evidence? We are moderately confident in the evidence. Our confidence was lowered mainly because of concerns about how some the trials were conducted, which included that many trials did not report all their results.

5c224f5289f0350001738d48,static_1,Insulin detemir versus insulin glargine for type 2 diabetes mellitus,"Chronically elevated blood glucose levels are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Many diabetes patients will eventually require insulin treatment to maintain good glycaemic control. There are still uncertainties about the optimal insulin treatment regimens for type 2 diabetes, but the long-acting insulin analogues seem beneficial. Several reviews have compared either insulin detemir or insulin glargine to NPH insulin, but research directly comparing both insulin analogues is limited.
To assess the effects of insulin detemir and insulin glargine compared with each other in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, online registries of ongoing trials and abstract books. Date of last search was January 2011.
All randomised controlled trials comparing insulin detemir with insulin glargine with a duration of 12 weeks or longer were included.
Two authors independently selected the studies and extracted the data. Pooling of studies by means of random-effects meta-analysis was performed.
This review examined four trials lasting 24 to 52 weeks involving 2250 people randomised to either insulin detemir or glargine. Overall, risk of bias of the evaluated studies was high. Insulin glargine was dosed once-daily in the evening. Insulin detemir was initiated once-daily in the evening with the option of an additional dose in the morning in three studies and initiated twice-daily in one study. Of randomised patients 13.6% to 57.2% were injecting insulin detemir twice-daily at the end of trial. Glycaemic control, measured by glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and HbA1c equal to or less than 7% with or without hypoglycaemia, did not differ statistically significantly between treatment groups. The results showed no significant differences in overall, nocturnal and severe hypoglycaemia between treatment groups. Insulin detemir was associated with less weight gain. Treatment with insulin glargine resulted in a lower daily basal insulin dose and a lower number of injection site reactions. There was no significant difference in the variability of FPG or glucose values in 24-hour profiles between treatment groups. It was not possible to draw conclusions on quality of life, costs or mortality. Only one trial reported results on health-related quality of life and showed no significant differences between treatment groups.
Our analyses suggest that there is no clinically relevant difference in efficacy or safety between insulin detemir and insulin glargine for targeting hyperglycaemia. However, to achieve the same glycaemic control insulin detemir was often injected twice-daily in a higher dose but with less weight gain, while insulin glargine was injected once-daily, with somewhat fewer injection site reactions.","The two long-acting insulin analogues (artificial insulins), insulin detemir or insulin glargine differ in their mechanism of attaining protracted action, leading to possible differences in glycaemic control and safety outcomes. Several studies have compared either insulin detemir or insulin glargine to NPH (Neutral Protamin Hagedorn) insulin. Research directly comparing both long-acting insulin analogues is limited.
Our aim was to systematically review the efficacy and safety of insulin detemir and insulin glargine in head-to-head studies in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Four studies investigated a total of 2250 people. Trials lasted between 24 and 52 weeks. Overall, risk of bias of the evaluated studies was high. Our analysis of these intermediate term trials comparing insulin detemir with insulin glargine showed that these two insulins were equally effective in achieving and maintaining glycaemic control (glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)). There were no differences in overall, nocturnal and severe hypoglycaemia when comparing insulin detemir to insulin glargine. Insulin detemir was associated with significantly less weight gain (one study showing a difference of 0.9 kg). Treatment with insulin glargine resulted in a lower daily basal insulin dose and a lower number of injection site reactions (1.8% of patients treated with insulin detemir compared to 0.4% of patients treated with insulin glargine had injection side reactions).
There was no difference in the variability of fasting glucose levels or the variability of glucose values of 24-hour profiles between the two treatment groups.
From the retrieved trials it was not possible to draw conclusions on the effects of these two insulins on quality of life, their costs or on the number of fatalities. Only one trial reported results on health-related quality of life and showed no significant differences between treatment groups.
Our analyses suggest that there is no clinically relevant difference in the efficacy or the safety between the use of insulin detemir and insulin glargine for treating type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, to achieve the same glycaemic control insulin detemir was often injected twice-daily in a higher dose but with less weight gain, while insulin glargine was only injected once-daily, with somewhat fewer injection site reactions.",1008,insulin glargine; insulin detemir; type 2 diabetes mellitus; glycaemic control; hypoglycaemia; glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c); injection site reactions; fasting plasma glucose (FPG); insulin treatment regimens; health-related quality of life,How did the different dosing schedules of insulin detemir and insulin glargine contribute to the overall findings of the study?,How does the study's conclusion on the efficacy equivalence of insulin detemir and insulin glargine impact future research directions?,Select all of the following that are colors,To what extent do the findings on injection site reactions influence the comparative safety evaluation of insulin detemir and insulin glargine?,Summarize the finding related to weight gain between the two insulin treatments.,The dosing differences were irrelevant to the glycaemic control outcomes.; Insulin detemir required more frequent injections but resulted in less weight gain.; Insulin glargine's once-daily dosing led to a higher risk of injection site reactions.,Insulin detemir required more frequent injections but resulted in less weight gain.,It suggests that research should focus on personalized treatment plans based on patient preference.; It indicates the need for more studies comparing these insulins with newer analogues.; It eliminates the necessity for any further comparative studies on these two insulins.,It suggests that research should focus on personalized treatment plans based on patient preference.; It indicates the need for more studies comparing these insulins with newer analogues.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,The lower rate of reactions with insulin glargine suggests it may be preferable for patients concerned about injection discomfort.; The similarity in injection site reactions indicates there is no safety difference.; The difference in injection site reactions is statistically but not clinically significant.,The lower rate of reactions with insulin glargine suggests it may be preferable for patients concerned about injection discomfort.,Insulin detemir was associated with significantly less weight gain.; Insulin glargine resulted in more weight gain.; Both insulins caused the same amount of weight gain.,Insulin detemir was associated with significantly less weight gain.
5c224f5289f0350001738d48,static_2,Self-management interventions including action plans for patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD),"Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) self-management interventions should be structured but personalised and often multi-component, with the goal of motivating, engaging, and supporting patients to adapt their behaviour and develop skills to better manage the disease. Exacerbation action plans are considered a key component of COPD self-management, but studies assessing these interventions have shown contradictory results. This review compared the effectiveness of COPD self-management interventions that include action plans for acute exacerbations with usual care. We evaluated the efficacy of COPD-specific self-management interventions that include an action plan for exacerbations compared with usual care in terms of health-related quality of life, respiratory-related hospital admissions, and other health outcomes. We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials, trials registries, and reference lists of included studies up to May 2016. We included randomised controlled trials published since 1995 that evaluated a self-management intervention for people with COPD. Eligible interventions included a written action plan for exacerbations and an iterative process between participants and healthcare providers in which feedback was provided. We excluded pulmonary rehabilitation programmes and group exercise classes to avoid overlap. Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data, resolving disagreements through consensus or with a third author. When appropriate, results were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. Primary outcomes were health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and the number of respiratory-related hospital admissions. We included 22 studies involving 3,854 participants with COPD. Follow-up ranged from two to 24 months, and intervention content varied widely. Over 12 months, self-management interventions with action plans showed a statistically significant beneficial effect on HRQoL, measured using the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire, with a mean difference of -2.69 points compared with usual care. Participants receiving self-management interventions were also at lower risk of at least one respiratory-related hospital admission (OR 0.69). The number needed to treat to prevent one respiratory-related admission over one year ranged from 12 to 17, depending on baseline risk. There was no statistically significant difference in all-cause hospital admission risk, number of hospitalisation days, emergency department visits, general practitioner visits, dyspnoea scores, number of COPD exacerbations, or all-cause mortality. Exploratory analysis showed a small but significantly higher respiratory-related mortality rate in the self-management group. Subgroup analyses showed that including a smoking cessation programme produced greater improvements in HRQoL than interventions without one. Other factors, such as the number of behavioural change techniques, intervention duration, and medication adaptation within action plans, did not significantly influence HRQoL. No variables were identified to explain differences in respiratory-related hospital admissions. Self-management interventions that include a COPD exacerbation action plan are associated with improved HRQoL and reduced respiratory-related hospital admissions. No excess all-cause mortality was observed, but there may be a small increase in respiratory-related mortality. Future studies should ensure that action plans are used only as part of interventions meeting the most up-to-date COPD self-management criteria and should provide clearer descriptions of intervention components to support further subgroup analyses. Action plans should account for comorbidities to increase safety, and future COPD self-management trials should involve Data and Safety Monitoring Boards.","We looked at the evidence on the effects of self-management interventions that include action plans for when COPD symptoms get worse, focusing on health-related quality of life and hospital admissions related to lung disease. People with COPD experience symptoms that worsen over time, leading to reduced well-being. Self-management interventions teach individuals what to do in different situations, including when symptoms worsen, helping them build skills and adopt behaviors that support managing their disease. Action plans outline specific steps to take when symptoms escalate. The effectiveness of these action plans has not been completely clear, even though they are now a common and central component of COPD management. We searched studies up to May 2016 and included 22 randomized trials with 3,854 participants. All studies compared self-management interventions that included an action plan to usual care, with follow-up periods ranging from two to 24 months. Self-management interventions that included an action plan improved health-related quality of life compared with usual care. They also reduced the number of people who had at least one hospital admission related to lung disease. However, there was a small but significant increase in respiratory-related deaths in the self-management group. The studies varied in the content of self-management programs, action plans, and the types of participants included.

We searched six electronic bibliographic databases for published articles and conference proceedings and three online databases for theses (all up to November 2011). Reference lists of relevant reports and reviews were also screened.
Randomised controlled trials of computer-based self-management interventions for adults with type 2 diabetes, i.e. computer-based software applications that respond to user input and aim to generate tailored content to improve one or more self-management domains through feedback, tailored advice, reinforcement and rewards, patient decision support, goal setting or reminders.
Two review authors independently screened the abstracts and extracted data. A taxonomy for behaviour change techniques was used to describe the active ingredients of the intervention.
We identified 16 randomised controlled trials with 3578 participants that fitted our inclusion criteria. These studies included a wide spectrum of interventions covering clinic-based brief interventions, Internet-based interventions that could be used from home and mobile phone-based interventions. The mean age of participants was between 46 to 67 years old and mean time since diagnosis was 6 to 13 years. The duration of the interventions varied between 1 to 12 months. There were three reported deaths out of 3578 participants. Computer-based diabetes self-management interventions currently have limited effectiveness. They appear to have small benefits on glycaemic control (pooled effect on glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c): -2.3 mmol/mol or -0.2% (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.4 to -0.1; P = 0.009; 2637 participants; 11 trials). The effect size on HbA1c was larger in the mobile phone subgroup (subgroup analysis: mean difference in HbA1c -5.5 mmol/mol or -0.5% (95% CI -0.7 to -0.3); P < 0.00001; 280 participants; three trials). Current interventions do not show adequate evidence for improving depression, health-related quality of life or weight. Four (out of 10) interventions showed beneficial effects on lipid profile. One participant withdrew because of anxiety but there were no other documented adverse effects. Two studies provided limited cost-effectiveness data - with one study suggesting costs per patient of less than $140 (in 1997) or 105 EURO and another study showed no change in health behaviour and resource utilisation.
Computer-based diabetes self-management interventions to manage type 2 diabetes appear to have a small beneficial effect on blood glucose control and the effect was larger in the mobile phone subgroup. There is no evidence to show benefits in other biological outcomes or any cognitive, behavioural or emotional outcomes.","Diabetes is one of the commonest long-term medical conditions, affecting around 347 million adults worldwide. Around 90% of them have type 2 diabetes and are at significant risk of developing diabetes related complications such as strokes or heart attacks. Patient education programmes can reduce the risk of diabetes-related complications, but many people with type 2 diabetes have never attended structured education programmes to learn how to look after themselves (self-management). Better use of computers might be one way of helping more people learn about self-management.
We identified 16 trials involving 3578 adults that met our criteria. These studies included different types of interventions used in different places like touch screen computers in hospital clinics, computers connected to the Internet at home and programmes that communicated with mobile phones. The average age of people taking part was between 46 to 67 years old and most of those people had lived with diabetes for 6 to 13 years. Participants were given access to the interventions for 1 to 12 months, depending on the intervention. Three out of the 3578 participants died but these deaths did not appear to be linked to the trials.
Overall, there is evidence that computer programmes have a small beneficial effect on blood sugar control - the estimated improvement in glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c - a long-term measurement of metabolic control) was 2.3 mmol/mol or 0.2%. This was slightly higher when we looked at studies that used mobile phones to deliver their intervention - the estimated improvement in HbA1c was 5.5 mmol/mol or 0.5% in the studies that used mobile phones. Some of the programmes lowered cholesterol slightly. None of the programmes helped with weight loss or coping with depression.
One participant withdrew because of anxiety but there were no obvious side effects and hypoglycaemic episodes were not reported in any of the studies. There was very little information about costs or value for money.
In summary, existing computer programmes to help adults self-manage type 2 diabetes appear to have a small positive effect on blood sugar control and the mobile phone interventions appeared to have larger effects. There is no evidence to show that current programmes can help with weight loss, depression or improving health-related quality of life but they do appear to be safe.",1003,type 2 diabetes mellitus; glycaemic control; computer-based self-management interventions; glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c); lipid profile; health-related quality of life; computer-based software applications; behaviour change techniques; mobile phone-based interventions; self-management domains,How do the motivations for using computer-based interventions relate to the potential cost-effectiveness in managing type 2 diabetes?,In what ways do the findings reflect a need to redesign future self-management programmes for improved outcomes?,Select all of the following that are colors,Evaluate the significance of glycaemic control improvements achieved through mobile phone interventions compared to other methods.,Summarize the overall effectiveness of computer-based interventions on blood sugar control.,Computer-based interventions can reduce resource burdens on healthcare systems.; They are primarily intended to replace traditional diabetes education programmes.; The goal is to increase the number of hypoglycaemic episodes reported.,Computer-based interventions can reduce resource burdens on healthcare systems.,Focus should be placed on addressing weight loss and depression.; Interventions should decrease reliance on hospital-based touch screen computers.; Current designs should emphasize increasing cholesterol reduction.,Focus should be placed on addressing weight loss and depression.,blue; green; pink,blue; green; pink,Mobile interventions yielded superior glycaemic outcomes.; Mobile interventions were less effective than traditional methods.; All methods are equally beneficial.,Mobile interventions yielded superior glycaemic outcomes.,They have a small beneficial effect.; They have a large beneficial effect.; They have no effect.,They have a small beneficial effect.
5c224f5289f0350001738d48,interactive_3,Exercise for type 2 diabetes mellitus,"Exercise is generally recommended for people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, some studies evaluate an exercise intervention including diet or behaviour modification or both, and the effects of diet and exercise are not differentiated. Some exercise studies involve low participant numbers, lacking power to show significant differences which may appear in larger trials.
To assess the effects of exercise in type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Trials were identified through the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and manual searches of bibliographies.
All randomised controlled trials comparing any type of well-documented aerobic, fitness or progressive resistance training exercise with no exercise in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Two authors independently selected trials, assessed trial quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information. Any information on adverse effects was collected from the trials.
Fourteen randomised controlled trials comparing exercise against no exercise in type 2 diabetes were identified involving 377 participants. Trials ranged from eight weeks to twelve months duration. Compared with the control, the exercise intervention significantly improved glycaemic control as indicated by a decrease in glycated haemoglobin levels of 0.6% (-0.6 % HbA1c, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.9 to -0.3; P < 0.05). This result is both statistically and clinically significant. There was no significant difference between groups in whole body mass, probably due to an increase in fat free mass (muscle) with exercise, as reported in one trial (6.3 kg, 95% CI 0.0 to 12.6). There was a reduction in visceral adipose tissue with exercise (-45.5 cm2, 95% CI -63.8 to -27.3), and subcutaneous adipose tissue also decreased. No study reported adverse effects in the exercise group or diabetic complications. The exercise intervention significantly increased insulin response (131 AUC, 95% CI 20 to 242) (one trial), and decreased plasma triglycerides (-0.25 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.48 to -0.02). No significant difference was found between groups in quality of life (one trial), plasma cholesterol or blood pressure.
The meta-analysis shows that exercise significantly improves glycaemic control and reduces visceral adipose tissue and plasma triglycerides, but not plasma cholesterol, in people with type 2 diabetes, even without weight loss.","Exercise, dietary changes and medications are frequently used in the management of type 2 diabetes. However, it is difficult to determine the independent effect of exercise from some trials because exercise has been combined with dietary modifications or medications, or compared with a control which includes another form of intervention. The review authors aimed to determine the effect of exercise on blood sugar control in type 2 diabetes.This review found that exercise improves blood sugar control and that this effect is evident even without weight loss. Furthermore, exercise decreases body fat content, thus the failure to lose weight with exercise programmes is probably explained by the conversion of fat to muscle. Exercise improved the body's reaction to insulin and decreased blood lipids. Quality of life was only assessed in one study, which found no difference between the two groups. No significant difference was found between groups in blood levels of cholesterol or blood pressure. A total of 14 randomised controlled trials were assessed. These included 377 participants and compared groups that differed only with respect to an exercise programme intervention. The duration of the interventions in the studies ranged from eight weeks to one year. Two studies reported follow-up information, one at six months after the end of the six month exercise intervention and one at twelve months post-intervention. Generally, the studies were well-conducted, but blinding of outcome assessors was not reported and although all studies reported that randomisation was performed, few gave details of the method. No adverse effects with exercise were reported. The effect of exercise on diabetic complications was not assessed in any of the studies.
The relatively short duration of trials prevented the reporting of any significant long term complications or mortality. Another limitation was the small number of participants included in the analyses for adiposity, blood pressure, cholesterol, body's muscle and quality of life.",1001,glycaemic control; glycated haemoglobin; type 2 diabetes mellitus; visceral adipose tissue; plasma triglycerides; exercise intervention; subcutaneous adipose tissue; insulin response; HbA1c; fat free mass,How might researchers justify the clinical relevance of the findings despite no noted weight loss in participants?,What was the main aim of the review authors?,Select all of the following that are fruits,Which outcome did exercise improve in type 2 diabetes management?,What was a significant effect of exercise identified in the trials?,Improvements in insulin response and decreased body fat; Lack of adverse effects from exercise interventions; Extended duration of exercise interventions,Improvements in insulin response and decreased body fat,To determine the effect of exercise on blood sugar control in type 2 diabetes.; To compare dietary and exercise interventions.; To analyze medication effects on type 2 diabetes.,To determine the effect of exercise on blood sugar control in type 2 diabetes.,dog; blue; grape,grape,Blood sugar control; Blood cholesterol levels; Blood pressure,Blood sugar control,Decreased body fat content; Increased overall body weight; Higher energy expenditure,Decreased body fat content
5c224f5289f0350001738d48,interactive_4,Are services organised to deliver care for people with atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat) better than usual (routine) care?,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an increasingly prevalent heart rhythm condition in adults. It is considered a common cardiovascular condition with complex clinical management. The increasing prevalence and complexity in management underpin the need to adapt and innovate in the delivery of care for people living with AF. There is a need to systematically examine the optimal way in which clinical services are organised to deliver evidence-based care for people with AF. Recommended approaches include collaborative, organised multidisciplinary, and virtual (or eHealth/mHealth) models of care.
To assess the effects of clinical service organisation for AF versus usual care for people with all types of AF.
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL to October 2022. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP to April 2023. We applied no restrictions on date, publication status, or language.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), published as full texts and as abstract only, involving adults (? 18 years) with a diagnosis of any type of AF. We included RCTs comparing organised clinical service, disease-specific management interventions (including e-health models of care) for people with AF that were multicomponent and multidisciplinary in nature to usual care.
Three review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data from the included studies. We calculated risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous data and mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using random-effects analyses. We then calculated the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) using the RR. We performed sensitivity analyses by only including studies with a low risk of selection and attrition bias. We assessed heterogeneity using the I² statistic and the certainty of the evidence according to GRADE. The primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and all-cause hospitalisation. The secondary outcomes were cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular hospitalisation, AF-related emergency department visits, thromboembolic complications, minor cerebrovascular bleeding events, major cerebrovascular bleeding events, all bleeding events, AF-related quality of life, AF symptom burden, cost of intervention, and length of hospital stay.
We included 8 studies (8205 participants) of collaborative, multidisciplinary care, or virtual care for people with AF. The average age of participants ranged from 60 to 73 years. The studies were conducted in China, the Netherlands, and Australia. The included studies involved either a nurse-led multidisciplinary approach (n = 4) or management using mHealth (n = 2) compared to usual care. Only six out of the eight included studies could be included in the meta-analysis (for all-cause mortality and all-cause hospitalisation, cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular hospitalisation, thromboembolic complications, and major bleeding), as quality of life was not assessed using a validated outcome measure specific for AF. We assessed the overall risk of bias as high, as all studies had at least one domain at unclear or high risk of bias rating for performance bias (blinding) in particular. Organised AF clinical services probably result in a large reduction in all-cause mortality (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.89; 5 studies, 4664 participants; moderate certainty evidence; 6-year NNTB 37) compared to usual care. However, organised AF clinical services probably make little to no difference to all-cause hospitalisation (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.02; 2 studies, 1340 participants; moderate certainty evidence; 2-year NNTB 101) and may not reduce cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.19; 5 studies, 4564 participants; low certainty evidence; 6-year NNTB 86) compared to usual care. Organised AF clinical services reduce cardiovascular hospitalisation (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.96; 3 studies, 3641 participants; high certainty evidence; 6-year NNTB 28) compared to usual care. Organised AF clinical services may have little to no effect on thromboembolic complications such as stroke (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.77; 5 studies, 4653 participants; low certainty evidence; 6-year NNTB 588) and major cerebrovascular bleeding events (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.97; 3 studies, 2964 participants; low certainty evidence; 6-year NNTB 556). None of the studies reported minor cerebrovascular events.
Moderate certainty evidence shows that organisation of clinical services for AF likely results in a large reduction in all-cause mortality, but probably makes little to no difference to all-cause hospitalisation compared to usual care. Organised AF clinical services may not reduce cardiovascular mortality, but do reduce cardiovascular hospitalisation compared to usual care. However, organised AF clinical services may make little to no difference to thromboembolic complications and major cerebrovascular events. None of the studies reported minor cerebrovascular events. Due to the limited number of studies, more research is required to compare different models of care organisation, including utilisation of mHealth. Appropriately powered trials are needed to confirm these findings and robustly examine the effect on inconclusive outcomes. The findings of this review underscore the importance of the co-ordination of care underpinned by collaborative multidisciplinary approaches and augmented by virtual care.","Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an irregular heartbeat that happens when the electrical signals in the heart fire quickly at the same time. This causes the heart to beat too fast or too slow, which can cause troubling symptoms and serious medical complications, including blood clots that can lead to stroke (where blood flow to the brain is blocked). Atrial fibrillation is treated with lifestyle changes, medication, and procedures, including surgery, to help prevent blood clots, control the heartbeat, or restore the heart's normal rhythm. Organised care services for AF involve: (i) providing care that is focused on improving people's care experiences, health outcomes, and quality of life; (ii) that is delivered by a team of healthcare providers from various fields of study working together; and (iii) that uses technology to support the integrated approach. Routine care is care provided as part of normal practice.
We wanted to find out if organised care services for AF were better than usual (routine) care in reducing death and hospital admission from all causes. We also wanted to find out if organised care services for AF were better than routine care in reducing heart-related death and hospital admissions, AF-related emergency department visits, complications such as stroke and mini-stroke, major and minor complications related to bleeding in the brain, AF-related quality of life, AF symptoms, length of hospital stay, and cost related to the services. We searched for studies comparing organised care services for AF to routine care in adults diagnosed with AF. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.
We found 8 studies involving a total of 8205 people with AF, with an average age of 60 to 73 years. The included studies were performed in China, the Netherlands, and Australia. All eight studies reported receiving individual grants or a combination of public funding and funding from industry. Compared to routine care, organised AF care services:
- prevent one death from all causes for every 37 patients treated and followed for six years;
- prevent one hospital admission from all causes for every 101 patients treated and followed for two years;
- prevent one heart-related death for every 86 patients treated and followed for six years; and
- prevent one heart-related hospital admission for every 28 patients treated and followed for six years; but
- may make little to no difference to complications such as stroke and mini-stroke (one complication prevented for every 588 patients treated and followed for six years) and major complications related to bleeding in the brain (one bleeding complication prevented for every 556 patients treated and followed for six years).
No study assessed minor complications related to bleeding in the brain.
Our confidence in the evidence for death and hospital admissions from all causes is only moderate because it is possible that some study participants were aware of which treatment they were getting, which could have influenced the results.
We have little confidence in the evidence for heart-related death because the ways treatment was delivered varied across studies, and it is possible that some study participants were aware of which treatment they were getting, which could have influenced the results. We are confident that organised care services for AF reduce heart-related hospital admissions.
We have little confidence in the evidence for complications and bleeding-related complications specifically because the ways treatment was delivered varied across studies, and it is possible that some study participants were aware of which treatment they were getting, which could have influenced the results.

5c224f5289f0350001738d48,interactive_4,Vitamin and mineral supplementation for preventing dementia or delaying cognitive decline in people with mild cognitive impairment,"Vitamins and minerals have many functions in the nervous system which are important for brain health. It has been suggested that various different vitamin and mineral supplements might be useful in maintaining cognitive function and delaying the onset of dementia. In this review, we sought to examine the evidence for this in people who already had mild cognitive impairment (MCI). To evaluate the effects of vitamin and mineral supplementation on cognitive function and the incidence of dementia in people with mild cognitive impairment. We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Groups (CDCIG) specialised register, as well as MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CENTRAL, CINAHL, LILACs, Web of Science Core Collection, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO Portal/ICTRP, from inception to 25 January 2018. We included randomised or quasi-randomised, placebo-controlled trials which evaluated orally administered vitamin or mineral supplements in participants with a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment and which assessed the incidence of dementia or cognitive outcomes, or both. We were interested in studies applicable to the general population of older people and therefore excluded studies in which participants had severe vitamin or mineral deficiencies. We sought data on our primary outcomes of dementia incidence and overall cognitive function and on secondary outcomes of episodic memory, executive function, speed of processing, quality of life, functional performance, clinical global impression, adverse events, and mortality. We conducted data collection and analysis according to standard Cochrane systematic review methods. We assessed the risk of bias of included studies using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' assessment tool. We grouped vitamins and minerals according to their putative mechanism of action and, where we considered it to be clinically appropriate, we pooled data using random-effects methods. We used GRADE methods to assess the overall quality of evidence for each comparison and outcome. We included five trials with 879 participants which investigated B vitamin supplements. In four trials, the intervention was a combination of vitamins B6, B12, and folic acid; in one, it was folic acid only. Doses varied. We considered there to be some risks of performance and attrition bias and of selective outcome reporting among these trials. Our primary efficacy outcomes were the incidence of dementia and scores on measures of overall cognitive function. None of the trials reported the incidence of dementia and the evidence on overall cognitive function was of very low-quality. There was probably little or no effect of B vitamins taken for six to 24 months on episodic memory, executive function, speed of processing, or quality of life. The evidence on our other secondary clinical outcomes, including harms, was very sparse or very low-quality. There was evidence from one study that there may be a slower rate of brain atrophy over two years in participants taking B vitamins. The same study reported subgroup analyses based on the level of serum homocysteine (tHcy) at baseline and found evidence that B vitamins may improve episodic memory in those with tHcy above the median at baseline. We included one trial (n = 516) of vitamin E supplementation. Vitamin E was given as 1000 IU of alpha-tocopherol twice daily. We considered this trial to be at risk of attrition and selective reporting bias. There was probably no effect of vitamin E on the probability of progression from MCI to Alzheimer's dementia over three years (HR 1.02; 95% CI 0.74 to 1.41; n = 516; 1 study, moderate-quality evidence). There was also no evidence of an effect at intermediate time points. The available data did not allow us to conduct analyses, but the authors reported no significant effect of three years of supplementation with vitamin E on overall cognitive function, episodic memory, speed of processing, clinical global impression, functional performance, adverse events, or mortality (five deaths in each group). We considered this to be low-quality evidence. We included one trial (n = 256) of combined vitamin E and vitamin C supplementation and one trial (n = 26) of supplementation with chromium picolinate. In both cases, there was a single eligible cognitive outcome, but we considered the evidence to be very low-quality and so could not be sure of any effects. The evidence on vitamin and mineral supplements as treatments for MCI is very limited. Three years of treatment with high-dose vitamin E probably does not reduce the risk of progression to dementia, but we have no data on this outcome for other supplements. Only B vitamins have been assessed in more than one RCT. There is no evidence for beneficial effects on cognition of supplementation with B vitamins for six to 24 months. Evidence from a single study of a reduced rate of brain atrophy in participants taking vitamin B and a beneficial effect of vitamin B on episodic memory in those with higher tHcy at baseline warrants attempted replication.","This review investigated whether people with mild cognitive impairment can reduce their risk of developing dementia, or can prevent their memory or other thinking skills from deteriorating further, by taking vitamin or mineral supplements. Slight changes in memory and thinking skills are common as people get older. When these changes are worse than can be expected in normal ageing, but are not bad enough to make a person's usual activities difficult to manage, then the person is said to have mild cognitive impairment (MCI). People with MCI are at increased risk of developing dementia in the future.
Vitamins and minerals are naturally occurring substances which are needed in the diet to maintain health. They have lots of different functions in the body and many are essential to keep the brain working properly. It has been suggested that supplementing a person's normal diet with extra doses of these vitamins or minerals might help to maintain thinking skills or prevent dementia.
We found eight randomised controlled trials (RCTs), which investigated four different types of vitamin or mineral pills by comparing them to a placebo (a dummy pill). The vitamins tested were B vitamins (vitamin B6, vitamin B12 and folic acid), vitamin E, and vitamin E and C given together. The only mineral tested was chromium. The amount and quality of research evidence about vitamin and mineral supplements for treating MCI in people without nutritional deficiency is limited. At the moment, it is not possible to identify any supplements which can reduce the risk of people with MCI developing dementia or which can effectively treat their symptoms.",1129,mild cognitive impairment; dementia; B vitamins; brain atrophy; episodic memory; executive function; speed of processing; functional performance; alpha-tocopherol; homocysteine level,What conclusions can be drawn from the study regarding the efficacy of B vitamins on overall cognitive function in people with mild cognitive impairment?,How does the evidence from the review support or refute the use of vitamin E in preventing progression to Alzheimer's dementia over three years?,Select the items that are animals,What factors would need to be addressed in future research to improve the reliability of findings related to vitamin supplementation and cognitive outcomes?,What was the primary focus of the study?,B vitamins significantly improve overall cognitive function.; B vitamins have little or no effect on overall cognitive function.; B vitamins show potential for improving overall cognitive function.,B vitamins have little or no effect on overall cognitive function.,Vitamin E has no significant effect on the progression to Alzheimer's dementia.; Vitamin E significantly reduces the risk of AlzheimerÃ¢ÂÂs dementia.; Vitamin E may have a potential impact on delaying AlzheimerÃ¢ÂÂs dementia.,Vitamin E has no significant effect on the progression to Alzheimer's dementia.,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,Increased sample sizes and long-term studies.; Exclusive focus on vitamin D supplementation.; Only testing on participants with severe deficiencies.,Increased sample sizes and long-term studies.,Reducing the risk of developing dementia with supplements; Developing new vitamin supplements; Improving physical fitness in the elderly,Reducing the risk of developing dementia with supplements
5c224f5289f0350001738d48,finetuned_5,Can strategies intended to improve how care is organised or delivered to people with overweight or obesity lead to greater weight reduction?,"The prevalence of overweight and obesity is increasing globally, an increase which has major implications for both population health and costs to health services. This is an update of a Cochrane Review.
To assess the effects of strategies to change the behaviour of health professionals or the organisation of care compared to standard care, to promote weight reduction in children and adults with overweight or obesity.
We searched the following databases for primary studies up to September 2016: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, DARE and PsycINFO. We searched the reference lists of included studies and two trial registries.
We considered randomised trials that compared routine provision of care with interventions aimed either at changing the behaviour of healthcare professionals or the organisation of care to promote weight reduction in children and adults with overweight or obesity. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane when conducting this review. We report the results for the professional interventions and the organisational interventions in seven 'Summary of findings' tables. We identified 12 studies for inclusion in this review, seven of which evaluated interventions targeting healthcare professional and five targeting the organisation of care. Eight studies recruited adults with overweight or obesity and four recruited children with obesity. Eight studies had an overall high risk of bias, and four had a low risk of bias. In total, 139 practices provided care to 89,754 people, with a median follow-up of 12 months. Professional interventions Educational interventions aimed at general practitioners (GPs), may slightly reduce the weight of participants (mean difference (MD) -1.24 kg, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.84 to 0.37; 3 studies, N = 1017 adults; low-certainty evidence). Tailoring interventions to improve GPs' compliance with obesity guidelines probably leads to little or no difference in weight loss (MD 0.05 (kg), 95% CI -0.32 to 0.41; 1 study, N = 49,807 adults; moderate-certainty evidence). It is uncertain if providing doctors with reminders results in a greater weight reduction than standard care (men: MD -11.20 kg, 95% CI -20.66 kg to -1.74 kg, and women: MD -1.30 kg, 95% CI [-7.34, 4.74] kg; 1 study, N = 90 adults; very low-certainty evidence). Providing clinicians with a clinical decision support (CDS) tool to assist with obesity management at the point of care leads to little or no difference in the body mass index (BMI) z-score of children (MD -0.08, 95% CI -0.15 to -0.01 in 378 children; moderate-certainty evidence), CDS tools may lead to little or no difference in weight loss in adults: MD -0.095 kg (-0.21 lbs), P = 0.47; 1 study, N = 35,665; low-certainty evidence. Organisational interventions Adults with overweight or obesity may lose more weight if the care was provided by a dietitian (by -5.60 kg, 95% CI -4.83 kg to -6.37 kg) or by a doctor-dietitian team (by -6.70 kg, 95% CI -7.52 kg to -5.88 kg; 1 study, N = 270 adults; low-certainty evidence). Shared care leads to little or no difference in the BMI z-score of children with obesity (adjusted MD -0.05, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.03; 1 study, N = 105 children; low-certainty evidence). Organisational restructuring of the delivery of primary care (i.e. introducing the chronic care model) may result in a slightly lower increase in the BMI of children who received care at intervention clinics (BMI change: adjusted MD -0.21, 95% CI -0.50 to 0.07; 1 study, unadjusted MD -0.18, 95% CI -0.20 to -0.16; N=473 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Mail and phone interventions probably lead to little or no difference in weight loss in adults (mean weight change (kg) using mail: -0.36, 95% CI -1.18 to 0.46; phone: -0.44, 95% CI -1.26 to 0.38; 1 study, N = 1801 adults; moderate-certainty evidence). Care delivered by a nurse at a primary care clinic may lead to little or no difference in the BMI z-score in children (MD -0.02, 95% CI -0.16 to 0.12; 1 study, N = 52 children; very low-certainty evidence). Two studies reported data on cost effectiveness: one study favoured mail and standard care over telephone consultations, and the other study achieved weight loss at a modest cost in both intervention groups (doctor and doctor-dietitian). One study of shared care reported similar adverse effects in both groups. We found little convincing evidence for a clinically-important effect on participants' weight or BMI of any of the evaluated interventions. While pooled results from three studies indicate that educational interventions targeting healthcare professionals may lead to a slight weight reduction in adults, the certainty of these results is low. Two trials evaluating CDS tools (unpooled results) for improved weight management suggest little or no effect on weight or BMI change in adults or children with overweight or obesity. Evidence for all the other interventions evaluated came mostly from single studies. The certainty of the included evidence varied from moderate to very low for the main outcomes (weight and BMI). All of the evaluated interventions would need further investigation to ascertain their strengths and limitations as effective strategies to change the behaviour of healthcare professionals or the organisation of care. As only two studies reported on cost, we know little about cost effectiveness across the evaluated interventions.","To assess the effectiveness of strategies to change the behaviour of health professionals and the organisation of care to promote weight reduction in people with overweight and obesity. This is an update of a Cochrane Review.
The number of people with overweight or obesity is increasing around the world. Excessive weight is associated with many chronic diseases. We searched the literature for studies that evaluated the effects of interventions aimed at changing the behaviour of health professionals or the way care is organised for improved weight management and weight loss. We included 12 studies, eight in adults and four in children. One hundred and thirty-nine family practices were included, providing care to 89,754 people who were followed for 12 months. Seven studies evaluated the effects of various interventions directed at healthcare professionals (i.e. education, reminders, and decision support tools), and the other five evaluated different organisational interventions (i.e. changes in who delivers the health care, how and where it is delivered, etc.). The comparison intervention was standard care, or the opportunity to seek it. The main outcomes assessed were weight or weight change for adults, and how their weight compared with their peers for children. Professional interventions: Brief education of primary care physicians in weight management may slightly decrease the weight of their patients. Tailoring the education to the healthcare professional to improve how closely they follow guidelines probably led to little or no difference in obesity management or weight loss at study end. We are uncertain whether issuing doctors with printed reminders about weight management strategies helped to reduce their patients' weight, compared to standard care.
Two studies reported that providing doctors with a clinical decision support tool within the practice may lead to little or no difference in the BMI of children with obesity or in the weight of adults with overweight or obesity, compared to patients receiving standard care. Organisational interventions: Two studies assessed the effect of multidisciplinary teams. Weight-loss programmes led by a dietitian or by a doctor plus a dietitian may lead to greater weight loss in adult patients than standard care. Shared care (between family practice and hospital doctors and dietitians) probably leads to little or no difference in the BMI of children with obesity, compared to standard care. Organisational restructuring of the delivery of family practice care (i.e. introducing the chronic care model: training of the whole practice team, enhanced electronic medical record system, the paediatric nurse practitioners playing a key role in delivering the intervention) led to a slightly lower increase in the BMI of children with obesity at intervention clinics, compared to standard care.
Two studies assessed changes in the setting of service delivery. The use of both mail and phone interventions to promote weight loss probably led to little or no difference in weight loss of adults with overweight or obesity, compared to standard care. Family practice weight management programmes conducted by nurses may lead to little or no difference in BMI in children with obesity, as compared to specialist obesity hospital clinics run by consultants.",1098,overweight; obesity; dietitian; general practitioners (GPs); chronic care model; primary care; adverse effects; intervention clinics,What factors may influence the effectiveness of health professional-targeted interventions on weight management?,How do organisational interventions compare to professional interventions in terms of weight loss outcomes for adults?,Select the items that are animals,"In assessing the interventions, what might be a limitation impacting the study results?",Which group showed a weight reduction from education interventions according to the findings?,The use of clinical decision support tools; The patient's socioeconomic status; Tailoring the education of healthcare providers,The use of clinical decision support tools; Tailoring the education of healthcare providers,Organisational interventions may lead to greater weight loss; Both interventions have equivalent outcomes; Professional interventions consistently lead to better outcomes,Organisational interventions may lead to greater weight loss,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,Variability in participant demographics; The low certainty of evidence; Inconsistent intervention duration,The low certainty of evidence,Adult patients; Children with obesity; Healthcare professionals,Adult patients
5c224f5289f0350001738d48,finetuned_6,Is metformin an effective treatment for adults with type 2 diabetes?,"Worldwide, there is an increasing incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Metformin is still the recommended first-line glucose-lowering drug for people with T2DM. Despite this, the effects of metformin on patient-important outcomes are still not clarified.
To assess the effects of metformin monotherapy in adults with T2DM.
We based our search on a systematic report from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and topped-up the search in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, WHO ICTRP, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Additionally, we searched the reference lists of included trials and systematic reviews, as well as health technology assessment reports and medical agencies. The date of the last search for all databases was 2 December 2019, except Embase (searched up 28 April 2017).
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with at least one year's duration comparing metformin monotherapy with no intervention, behaviour changing interventions or other glucose-lowering drugs in adults with T2DM.
Two review authors read all abstracts and full-text articles/records, assessed risk of bias, and extracted outcome data independently. We resolved discrepancies by involvement of a third review author. For meta-analyses we used a random-effects model with investigation of risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes, using 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for effect estimates. We assessed the overall certainty of the evidence by using the GRADE instrument.
We included 18 RCTs with multiple study arms (N = 10,680). The percentage of participants finishing the trials was approximately 58% in all groups. Treatment duration ranged from one to 10.7 years. We judged no trials to be at low risk of bias on all 'Risk of bias' domains. The main outcomes of interest were all-cause mortality, serious adverse events (SAEs), health-related quality of life (HRQoL), cardiovascular mortality (CVM), non-fatal myocardial infarction (NFMI), non-fatal stroke (NFS), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Two trials compared metformin (N = 370) with insulin (N = 454). Neither trial reported on all-cause mortality, SAE, CVM, NFMI, NFS or ESRD. One trial provided information on HRQoL but did not show a substantial difference between the interventions. Seven trials compared metformin with sulphonylureas. Four trials reported on all-cause mortality: in three trials no participant died, and in the remaining trial 31/1454 participants (2.1%) in the metformin group died compared with 31/1441 participants (2.2%) in the sulphonylurea group (very low-certainty evidence). Three trials reported on SAE: in two trials no SAE occurred (186 participants); in the other trial 331/1454 participants (22.8%) in the metformin group experienced a SAE compared with 308/1441 participants (21.4%) in the sulphonylurea group (very low-certainty evidence). Two trials reported on CVM: in one trial no CVM was observed and in the other trial 4/1441 participants (0.3%) in the metformin group died of cardiovascular reasons compared with 8/1447 participants (0.6%) in the sulphonylurea group (very low-certainty evidence). Three trials reported on NFMI: in two trials no NFMI occurred, and in the other trial 21/1454 participants (1.4%) in the metformin group experienced a NFMI compared with 15/1441 participants (1.0%) in the sulphonylurea group (very low-certainty evidence). One trial reported no NFS occurred (very low-certainty evidence). No trial reported on HRQoL or ESRD. Seven trials compared metformin with thiazolidinediones (very low-certainty evidence for all outcomes). Five trials reported on all-cause mortality: in two trials no participant died; the overall RR was 0.88, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.39; P = 0.57; 5 trials; 4402 participants). Four trials reported on SAE, the RR was 0,95, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.09; P = 0.49; 3208 participants. Four trials reported on CVM, the RR was 0.71, 95% CI 0.21 to 2.39; P = 0.58; 3211 participants. Three trial reported on NFMI: in two trials no NFMI occurred and in one trial 21/1454 participants (1.4%) in the metformin group experienced a NFMI compared with 25/1456 participants (1.7%) in the thiazolidinedione group. One trial reported no NFS occurred. No trial reported on HRQoL or ESRD. Three trials compared metformin with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (one trial each with saxagliptin, sitagliptin, vildagliptin with altogether 1977 participants). There was no substantial difference between the interventions for all-cause mortality, SAE, CVM, NFMI and NFS (very low-certainty evidence for all outcomes). One trial compared metformin with a glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue (very low-certainty evidence for all reported outcomes). There was no substantial difference between the interventions for all-cause mortality, CVM, NFMI and NFS. One or more SAEs were reported in 16/268 (6.0%) of the participants allocated to metformin compared with 35/539 (6.5%) of the participants allocated to a glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue. HRQoL or ESRD were not reported. One trial compared metformin with meglitinide and two trials compared metformin with no intervention. No deaths or SAEs occurred (very low-certainty evidence)no other patient-important outcomes were reported. No trial compared metformin with placebo or a behaviour changing interventions. Four ongoing trials with 5824 participants are likely to report one or more of our outcomes of interest and are estimated to be completed between 2018 and 2024. Furthermore, 24 trials with 2369 participants are awaiting assessment.
There is no clear evidence whether metformin monotherapy compared with no intervention, behaviour changing interventions or other glucose-lowering drugs influences patient-important outcomes.","Type 2 diabetes is a condition that causes high levels of sugar in the blood. Blood sugar levels are controlled by insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas. Insulin instructs the liver, muscles and fat cells to remove sugar from the blood and store it. When the pancreas does not make enough insulin, or the body does not respond to insulin, too much sugar stays in the blood. Many medicines for treating type 2 diabetes are available. These aim to lower the amount of sugar in the blood and reduce long-term complications of diabetes. The first medicine that is usually prescribed to people with type 2 diabetes is metformin. Metformin works by reducing the amount of sugar that the liver releases into the blood. It also improves the way the body responds to insulin. We wanted to find out whether metformin is an effective treatment for type 2 diabetes, and whether it causes any unwanted effects. We also wanted to compare its effects with other antidiabetic medicines, and with diets, exercise or both. The outcomes we were specifically interested in were death, serious unwanted events, health-related quality of life, death from cardiovascular causes, and non-fatal complications of diabetes (for example heart attacks, strokes or kidney failure). We searched medical databases for studies that were randomised controlled trials, which are medical studies where participants are put randomly into one of the treatment groups and provide the most reliable evidence about whether treatments make a difference; included people aged 18 years or older with type 2 diabetes; compared metformin with a placebo (fake treatment), no treatment, diet programmes, or another medicine that lowers blood sugar; and lasted at least one year. We found 18 studies with multiple study arms including a total of 10,680 participants. The studies lasted between one year and approximately 11 years. They compared metformin with insulin injections (two studies); other medicines that lower blood sugar levels such as sulphonylureas (seven studies), thiazolidinediones (seven studies), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (three studies), a glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue (one study), and a meglitinide (one study); and no treatment (two studies). No study compared metformin with a placebo or with diet or exercise programmes. Almost all studies investigated laboratory measurements of blood sugar control like fasting blood glucose. However, there was little information on patient-important outcomes such as death, serious unwanted events, health-related quality of life, death from cardiovascular causes, and non-fatal complications of diabetes when comparing metformin with other medicines, placebo or no intervention. The available data did not show any clear benefit or harm of metformin. Four ongoing studies with 5824 participants will report one or more of our outcomes of interest and will be completed between 2018 and 2024. Furthermore, 24 studies with 2369 participants could be used in a future update of our review once results are published.",1005,type 2 diabetes mellitus; metformin monotherapy; serious adverse events; non-fatal myocardial infarction; health-related quality of life; end-stage renal disease; sulphonylureas; thiazolidinediones; dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors; glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue,In what ways do the study's findings challenge the standard use of metformin as a first-line treatment for T2DM?,"Given the study's findings, how should metformin's role be reassessed in the context of other glucose-lowering therapies?",Select the items that are animals,What is the primary focus of the study regarding metformin?,What did the study find about metformin's comparison with other medicines?,The absence of significant differences in serious adverse events; Metformin's superior effect on cardiovascular outcomes; The lack of evidence on health-related quality of life improvements,The absence of significant differences in serious adverse events; The lack of evidence on health-related quality of life improvements,As a similar option with unclear additional benefits; As the most effective option for preventing diabetes complications; As a supplementary treatment to other therapies,As a similar option with unclear additional benefits,Chair; Lamp; Dog,Dog,To evaluate its efficacy and safety as a treatment for type 2 diabetes.; To compare its effects with insulin in type 1 diabetes patients.; To determine its production methods.,To evaluate its efficacy and safety as a treatment for type 2 diabetes.,No clear benefit or harm compared to other treatments.; Significantly better at preventing complications.; Worse at controlling blood sugar levels.,No clear benefit or harm compared to other treatments.
5c224f5289f0350001738d48,finetuned_6,"Improving the implementation of healthy eating, physical activity and obesity prevention policies, practices or programmes in childcare services","Despite the existence of effective interventions and best-practice guideline recommendations for childcare services to implement evidence-based policies, practices and programmes to promote child healthy eating, physical activity and prevent unhealthy weight gain, many services fail to do so. The primary aim of the review was to examine the effectiveness of strategies aimed at improving the implementation of policies, practices or programmes by childcare services that promote child healthy eating, physical activity and/or obesity prevention.The secondary aims of the review were to: 1. Examine the cost or cost-effectiveness of such strategies;2. Examine any adverse effects of such strategies on childcare services, service staff or children;3. Examine the effect of such strategies on child diet, physical activity or weight status. 4. Describe the acceptability, adoption, penetration, sustainability and appropriateness of such implementation strategies. We searched the following electronic databases on February 22 2019: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In Process, Embase, PsycINFO, ERIC, CINAHL and SCOPUS for relevant studies. We searched reference lists of included studies, handsearched two international implementation science journals, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (www.who.int/ictrp/) and ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov). We included any study (randomised or nonrandomised) with a parallel control group that compared any strategy to improve the implementation of a healthy eating, physical activity or obesity prevention policy, practice or programme by staff of centre-based childcare services to no intervention, 'usual' practice or an alternative strategy. Centre-based childcare services included preschools, nurseries, long daycare services and kindergartens catering for children prior to compulsory schooling (typically up to the age of five to six years).
Two review authors independently screened study titles and abstracts, extracted study data and assessed risk of bias; we resolved discrepancies via consensus. We performed meta-analysis using a random-effects model where studies with suitable data and homogeneity were identified; otherwise, findings were described narratively. Twenty-one studies, including 16 randomised and five nonrandomised, were included in the review. The studies sought to improve the implementation of policies, practices or programmes targeting healthy eating (six studies), physical activity (three studies) or both healthy eating and physical activity (12 studies). Studies were conducted in the United States (n = 12), Australia (n = 8) and Ireland (n = 1). Collectively, the 21 studies included a total of 1945 childcare services examining a range of implementation strategies including educational materials, educational meetings, audit and feedback, opinion leaders, small incentives or grants, educational outreach visits or academic detailing, reminders and tailored interventions. Most studies (n = 19) examined implementation strategies versus usual practice or minimal support control, and two compared alternative implementation strategies. For implementation outcomes, six studies (one RCT) were judged to be at high risk of bias overall. The review findings suggest that implementation strategies probably improve the implementation of policies, practices or programmes that promote child healthy eating, physical activity and/or obesity prevention in childcare services. Of the 19 studies that compared a strategy to usual practice or minimal support control, 11 studies (nine RCTs) used score-based measures of implementation (e.g. childcare service nutrition environment score). Nine of these studies were included in pooled analysis, which found an improvement in implementation outcomes (SMD 0.49; 95% CI 0.19 to 0.79; participants = 495; moderate-certainty evidence). Ten studies (seven RCTs) used dichotomous measures of implementation (e.g. proportion of childcare services implementing a policy or specific practice), with seven of these included in pooled analysis (OR 1.83; 95% CI 0.81 to 4.11; participants = 391; low-certainty evidence). Findings suggest that such interventions probably lead to little or no difference in child physical activity (four RCTs; moderate-certainty evidence) or weight status (three RCTs; moderate-certainty evidence), and may lead to little or no difference in child diet (two RCTs; low-certainty evidence). None of the studies reported the cost or cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Three studies assessed the adverse effects of the intervention on childcare service staff, children and parents, with all studies suggesting they have little to no difference in adverse effects (e.g. child injury) between groups (three RCTs; low-certainty evidence). Inconsistent quality of the evidence was identified across review outcomes and study designs, ranging from very low to moderate. The primary limitation of the review was the lack of conventional terminology in implementation science, which may have resulted in potentially relevant studies failing to be identified based on the search terms used. Current research suggests that implementation strategies probably improve the implementation of policies, practices or programmes by childcare services, and may have little or no effect on measures of adverse effects. However such strategies appear to have little to no impact on measures of child diet, physical activity or weight status.","This review aimed to look at the effects of strategies to improve the implementation (or correct undertaking) of policies, practices or programmes by childcare services that promote children's healthy eating, physical activity and/or obesity prevention. We wanted to determine the cost or cost-effectiveness of providing implementation support, whether support strategies were associated with any adverse effects, and whether there was an impact on child nutrition, physical activity or weight status. We also looked at the implementation strategy acceptability, adoption, penetration, sustainability and appropriateness. A number of childcare service-based interventions have been found to be effective in improving child diet, increasing child physical activity and preventing excessive weight gain. Despite the existence of such evidence and best-practice guideline recommendations for childcare services to implement these policies, practices or programmes, many childcare services fail to do so. Without proper implementation, children will not benefit from these child health-directed policies, practices or programmes. We identified 21 studies, 19 of which examined implementation strategies versus usual practice or minimal support control, and two that compared different types of implementation strategies. The studies sought to improve the implementation of policies, practices or programmes targeting healthy eating (six studies), physical activity (three studies) or both healthy eating and physical activity (twelve studies). Collectively, the 21 included studies included a total of 1945 childcare services and examined a range of implementation strategies including educational materials, educational meetings, audit and feedback, opinion leaders, small incentives or grants, educational outreach visits or academic detailing, reminders and tailored interventions. The strategies tested were only a small number of those that could be applied to improve implementation in this setting. Findings suggest that implementation support strategies can improve the implementation of physical activity policies, programmes or practices by childcare services or their staff (moderate-certainty evidence), and do not appear to increase the risk of child injury (low-certainty evidence). However, such approaches do not appear to have an impact on the diet, physical activity or weight status of children (low to moderate-certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported information regarding implementation strategy costs or measures of cost-effectiveness.
