      "Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of mortality worldwide with approximately 7.4 million deaths each year. People with established coronary heart disease have a high risk of subsequent cardiovascular events including myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death. Antibiotics might prevent such outcomes due to their antibacterial, antiinflammatory, and antioxidative effects. However, a randomised clinical trial and several observational studies have suggested that antibiotics may increase the risk of cardiovascular events and mortality. Furthermore, several non-Cochrane Reviews, that are now outdated, have assessed the effects of antibiotics for coronary heart disease and have shown conflicting results. No previous systematic review using Cochrane methodology has assessed the effects of antibiotics for coronary heart disease. We assessed the benefits and harms of antibiotics compared with placebo or no intervention for the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, SCI-EXPANDED, and BIOSIS in December 2019 in order to identify relevant trials. Additionally, we searched TRIP, Google Scholar, and nine trial registries in December 2019. We also contacted 11 pharmaceutical companies and searched the reference lists of included trials, previous systematic reviews, and other types of reviews. Randomised clinical trials assessing the effects of antibiotics versus placebo or no intervention for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease in adult participants (?18 years) were included irrespective of setting, blinding, publication status, publication year, language, and reporting of outcomes. Three review authors independently extracted data. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, serious adverse event according to ICH-GCP, and quality of life. Secondary outcomes were cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, and sudden cardiac death. The primary time point of interest was at maximum follow-up, and data were also extracted at 24�6 months follow-up. Risks of systematic errors were assessed using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool, and risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated. We included 38 trials randomising 26,638 participants (mean age 61.6 years), with 23/38 trials reporting data on 26,078 participants suitable for meta-analysis. Three trials were at low risk of bias and the remaining 35 were at high risk of bias. Trials assessing macrolides (28 trials; 22,059 participants) and quinolones (two trials; 4162 participants) contributed most of the data. Meta-analyses at maximum follow-up showed that antibiotics versus placebo or no intervention seemed to increase the risk of all-cause mortality (RR 1.06; 95% CI 0.99 to 1.13), stroke (RR 1.14; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.29), and probably also cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.11; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.25). Little to no difference was observed for myocardial infarction (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.88 to 1.03) and sudden cardiac death (RR 1.08; 95% CI 0.90 to 1.31). Meta-analyses at 24�6 months follow-up showed that antibiotics increased the risk of all-cause mortality (RR 1.25; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.48), cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.50; 95% CI 1.17 to 1.91), and probably also sudden cardiac death (RR 1.77; 95% CI 1.28 to 2.44). No evidence of a difference was found for myocardial infarction or stroke at this time point. Meta-analyses of trials at low risk of bias differed only for cardiovascular mortality at maximum follow-up; all other outcomes were consistent with overall analyses. None of the trials specifically assessed serious adverse events according to ICH-GCP, and no data were available on quality of life. Current evidence suggests that antibiotics (macrolides or quinolones) for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease appear harmful when assessing all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and stroke at maximum follow-up, as well as all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and sudden cardiac death at 24�6 months follow-up. Therefore, current evidence does not support the clinical use of macrolides or quinolones for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease. Future trials examining the safety of these antibiotics for this purpose do not seem ethical, and antibiotic trials in general require longer follow-up to capture late adverse events.\n",
