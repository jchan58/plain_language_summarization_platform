    "abstract = \"\"\"There is a large body of evidence evaluating quality improvement (QI) programmes to improve care for adults living with diabetes. These programmes are often comprised of multiple QI strategies, which may be implemented in various combinations. Decision-makers planning to implement or evaluate a new QI programme, or both, need reliable evidence on the relative effectiveness of different QI strategies (individually and in combination) for different patient populations.\n",
    "To update existing systematic reviews of diabetes QI programmes and apply novel meta-analytical techniques to estimate the effectiveness of QI strategies (individually and in combination) on diabetes quality of care.\n",
    "We searched databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL) and trials registers (ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP) to 4 June 2019. We conducted a top-up search to 23 September 2021; we screened these search results and 42 studies meeting our eligibility criteria are available in the awaiting classification section.\n",
    "We included randomised trials that assessed a QI programme to improve care in outpatient settings for people living with diabetes. QI programmes needed to evaluate at least one system- or provider-targeted QI strategy alone or in combination with a patient-targeted strategy. - System-targeted: case management (CM); team changes (TC); electronic patient registry (EPR); facilitated relay of clinical information (FR); continuous quality improvement (CQI). - Provider-targeted: audit and feedback (AF); clinician education (CE); clinician reminders (CR); financial incentives (FI). - Patient-targeted: patient education (PE); promotion of self-management (PSM); patient reminders (PR). Patient-targeted QI strategies needed to occur with a minimum of one provider or system-targeted strategy.\n",
    "We dual-screened search results and abstracted data on study design, study population and QI strategies. We assessed the impact of the programmes on 13 measures of diabetes care, including: glycaemic control (e.g. mean glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c)); cardiovascular risk factor management (e.g. mean systolic blood pressure (SBP), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), proportion of people living with diabetes that quit smoking or receiving cardiovascular medications); and screening/prevention of microvascular complications (e.g. proportion of patients receiving retinopathy or foot screening); and harms (e.g. proportion of patients experiencing adverse hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia). We modelled the association of each QI strategy with outcomes using a series of hierarchical multivariable meta-regression models in a Bayesian framework. The previous version of this review identified that different strategies were more or less effective depending on baseline levels of outcomes. To explore this further, we extended the main additive model for continuous outcomes (HbA1c, SBP and LDL-C) to include an interaction term between each strategy and average baseline risk for each study (baseline thresholds were based on a data-driven approach; we used the median of all baseline values reported in the trials). Based on model diagnostics, the baseline interaction models for HbA1c, SBP and LDL-C performed better than the main model and are therefore presented as the primary analyses for these outcomes. Based on the model results, we qualitatively ordered each QI strategy within three tiers (Top, Middle, Bottom) based on its magnitude of effect relative to the other QI strategies, where 'Top' indicates that the QI strategy was likely one of the most effective strategies for that specific outcome. Secondary analyses explored the sensitivity of results to choices in model specification and priors. Additional information about the methods and results of the review are available as Appendices in an online repository. This review will be maintained as a living systematic review; we will update our syntheses as more data become available.\n",
    "We identified 553 trials (428 patient-randomised and 125 cluster-randomised trials), including a total of 412,161 participants. Of the included studies, 66% involved people living with type 2 diabetes only. Participants were 50% female and the median age of participants was 58.4 years. The mean duration of follow-up was 12.5 months. HbA1c was the commonest reported outcome; screening outcomes and outcomes related to cardiovascular medications, smoking and harms were reported infrequently. The most frequently evaluated QI strategies across all study arms were PE, PSM and CM, while the least frequently evaluated QI strategies included AF, FI and CQI. Our confidence in the evidence is limited due to a lack of information on how studies were conducted. Four QI strategies (CM, TC, PE, PSM) were consistently identified as 'Top' across the majority of outcomes. All QI strategies were ranked as 'Top' for at least one key outcome. The majority of effects of individual QI strategies were modest, but when used in combination could result in meaningful population-level improvements across the majority of outcomes. The median number of QI strategies in multicomponent QI programmes was three. Combinations of the three most effective QI strategies were estimated to lead to the below effects: - PR + PSM + CE: decrease in HbA1c by 0.41% (credibility interval (CrI) -0.61 to -0.22) when baseline HbA1c < 8.3%; - CM + PE + EPR: decrease in HbA1c by 0.62% (CrI -0.84 to -0.39) when baseline HbA1c > 8.3%; - PE + TC + PSM: reduction in SBP by 2.14 mmHg (CrI -3.80 to -0.52) when baseline SBP < 136 mmHg; - CM + TC + PSM: reduction in SBP by 4.39 mmHg (CrI -6.20 to -2.56) when baseline SBP > 136 mmHg; - TC + PE + CM: LDL-C lowering of 5.73 mg/dL (CrI -7.93 to -3.61) when baseline LDL < 107 mg/dL; - TC + CM + CR: LDL-C lowering by 5.52 mg/dL (CrI -9.24 to -1.89) when baseline LDL > 107 mg/dL. Assuming a baseline screening rate of 50%, the three most effective QI strategies were estimated to lead to an absolute improvement of 33% in retinopathy screening (PE + PR + TC) and 38% absolute increase in foot screening (PE + TC + Other).\n",
    "There is a significant body of evidence about QI programmes to improve the management of diabetes. Multicomponent QI programmes for diabetes care (comprised of effective QI strategies) may achieve meaningful population-level improvements across the majority of outcomes. For health system decision-makers, the evidence summarised in this review can be used to identify strategies to include in QI programmes. For researchers, this synthesis identifies higher-priority QI strategies to examine in further research regarding how to optimise their evaluation and effects. We will maintain this as a living systematic review.\"\"\""

      "What exactly counts as “exercise” in these trials (type, intensity, how often, how long), and does one kind work better than others?; What does a 0.6% drop in HbA1c mean in everyday terms for someone with type 2 diabetes (how big/important is that change)?; If body weight didn’t change, how can exercise still improve blood sugar—what do “fat free mass” and “visceral adipose tissue” mean and why do they matter?; How reliable are these results given there were only 377 people across 14 studies—were the studies good quality and long enough to be confident?; Were there any risks or downsides of exercising for these participants, and why might no adverse effects have been reported?\n",
      "What exactly counts as a “quality improvement (QI) strategy” in this review, and what do examples like case management, team changes, and patient self-management promotion look like in real clinics?; How should I interpret the reported changes (e.g., HbA1c down 0.62%, systolic blood pressure down 4.39 mmHg, LDL down ~5.7 mg/dL)—are these big enough to matter for patients?; What does it mean that some strategies work better depending on “baseline” HbA1c/SBP/LDL levels, and why did they split results at thresholds like HbA1c 8.3%?; When they say combining multiple strategies leads to better results, how do we know which combinations are best and whether adding more strategies always helps (or could backfire/cost too much)?; How confident should we be in these findings given they say “confidence is limited” and some outcomes (like harms, smoking, medication use) were reported infrequently?\n",
      "What exactly counts as a “computer-based diabetes self-management intervention” in these studies (websites, apps, texts, clinic kiosks), and what do they actually ask patients to do?; What does HbA1c measure, and how meaningful is a change of -0.2% overall (or -0.5% for mobile phone programs) for a person’s health and risk of complications?; Why did the mobile phone subgroup seem to work better—were those programs different in features, frequency, or who used them?; If these programs didn’t improve weight, mood/depression, or quality of life, what outcomes should patients and doctors realistically expect them to help with?; How reliable are these results (study quality, duration, dropouts), and do we know whether these programs are worth the cost compared with standard care or in-person education?\n",
      "What does “patient-important outcomes” mean here (e.g., living longer, avoiding heart attacks/strokes, feeling better), and how is it different from just lowering blood sugar numbers?; What does “very low-certainty evidence” mean in plain language—does it mean metformin probably doesn’t help, or that the studies weren’t good enough to tell?; Why did so many people (only about 58%) finish the trials, and how could that affect the reliability of the results?; When metformin was compared to other diabetes drugs (like sulphonylureas, thiazolidinediones, DPP-4 inhibitors, GLP-1 drugs), what were the main differences in benefits and harms that matter to patients?; If metformin is still the recommended first choice, what evidence (beyond these trials) is that recommendation based on, and what should a patient take away from this review?\n",
      "What exactly are GLP-1 analogues/agonists, and how do they help lower blood sugar in type 2 diabetes?;What does “HbA1c reduced by about 1%” mean in terms of real-life diabetes control and risk of complications?;How do GLP-1 drugs compare with insulin and common diabetes pills (like sulphonylureas, sitagliptin, pioglitazone/rosiglitazone) in effectiveness and side effects?;What are the main side effects (especially nausea and hypoglycaemia), how common/severe are they, and who is most at risk?;Since most studies were only ~26 weeks, what is known (or not known) about long-term benefits and harms of GLP-1 drugs?\n",
      "What exactly are GLP-1 receptor agonists, and how do they work for people with type 2 diabetes?; What do the kidney disease “stages 1–5” mean in everyday terms, and how sick are the people in each stage?; What are “3-point” and “4-point” major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), and why are they important?; When the results say things like RR 0.85 with a 95% confidence interval, what does that mean in plain language, and how big is the real-life benefit (e.g., “52 people prevented per 1000 treated”)?; What side effects or harms are most common or serious with GLP-1 drugs in people with CKD, and how do they compare to other diabetes medicines (like insulin, SGLT2 inhibitors, or DPP-4 inhibitors)?\n",
      "What are insulin detemir, insulin glargine, and NPH insulin, and how are they different from each other?; What do HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and “24-hour glucose profiles” mean, and why are they important for judging diabetes control?; What is hypoglycaemia (especially “nocturnal” and “severe” hypoglycaemia), and how big a difference would matter to patients?; What does “high risk of bias” mean in these trials, and how much should it affect how confident we are in the results?; If detemir often needs higher doses and sometimes twice-daily injections but causes less weight gain, how should someone choose between these insulins in real life (including cost and quality of life)?\n",
      "What exactly are metformin and sulphonylureas, and why are they often used together for type 2 diabetes?; Compared to metformin combined with newer drugs (like GLP-1, DPP-4, SGLT2, etc.), what were the main differences in benefits and harms—especially deaths, heart attacks/strokes, and serious side effects?; What does it mean when the evidence is “low-certainty” or “very low-certainty,” and how should that affect how much we trust the results?; What is hypoglycaemia, how much more often did it happen with metformin+sulphonylurea, and how serious is it in real life?; If the results were “inconclusive,” what should a patient and doctor consider when choosing between metformin+sulphonylurea and other add-on medicines (including cost, weight, and daily convenience)?\n",
      "What does it mean to be “at increased risk” of type 2 diabetes—what are IGT and IFG, and how are they diagnosed?; What exactly were the diet and physical activity programs in these studies (what changes did people make, and how intense were they)?; What does “RR 0.57” mean in plain language—how much does combining diet + exercise lower a person’s actual chance of getting diabetes?; Why is the evidence for deaths and diabetes complications described as “very low-quality,” and how much should we trust those results?; What are “patient-important outcomes” (like heart attacks, blindness, kidney failure, quality of life), and why were there so few data on them?\n",
      "What exactly are alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, and how do drugs like acarbose and voglibose lower blood sugar?; What do “impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), impaired fasting glucose (IFG), and moderately elevated HbA1c” mean in plain terms, and how close are they to having type 2 diabetes?; How big is the real-world benefit—e.g., how many people would need to take an AGI for a year (or longer) to prevent one case of type 2 diabetes?; What does “low-certainty” or “very low-certainty” evidence (GRADE) mean, and why is the certainty low in these results?; What side effects are most common (especially stomach/bowel problems), how serious are they, and do they make people stop taking the medication?\n",
      "What exactly is “cancer-related fatigue,” how is it different from normal tiredness, and how do the studies measure it (e.g., what do FACIT-Fatigue and other scales mean)?; What counts as “cardiovascular training” versus “resistance training” in these trials (how hard, how often, and for how long were people exercising)?; What does it mean when the results say “very low-certainty evidence” and “high risk of bias,” and how much should that affect how I trust the findings?; Were the people in these studies similar to most cancer patients (types/stages of cancer, treatments, age/health), and would the results apply to someone before, during, or after treatment?; What are the practical takeaways—based on what’s known, should someone with cancer choose cardio, resistance training, or both, and what are the safety concerns/adverse events?\n"
