      "Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of mortality worldwide with approximately 7.4 million deaths each year. People with established coronary heart disease have a high risk of subsequent cardiovascular events including myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death. Antibiotics might prevent such outcomes due to their antibacterial, antiinflammatory, and antioxidative effects. However, a randomised clinical trial and several observational studies have suggested that antibiotics may increase the risk of cardiovascular events and mortality. Furthermore, several non-Cochrane Reviews, that are now outdated, have assessed the effects of antibiotics for coronary heart disease and have shown conflicting results. No previous systematic review using Cochrane methodology has assessed the effects of antibiotics for coronary heart disease. We assessed the benefits and harms of antibiotics compared with placebo or no intervention for the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, SCI-EXPANDED, and BIOSIS in December 2019 in order to identify relevant trials. Additionally, we searched TRIP, Google Scholar, and nine trial registries in December 2019. We also contacted 11 pharmaceutical companies and searched the reference lists of included trials, previous systematic reviews, and other types of reviews. Randomised clinical trials assessing the effects of antibiotics versus placebo or no intervention for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease in adult participants (?18 years) were included irrespective of setting, blinding, publication status, publication year, language, and reporting of outcomes. Three review authors independently extracted data. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, serious adverse event according to ICH-GCP, and quality of life. Secondary outcomes were cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, and sudden cardiac death. The primary time point of interest was at maximum follow-up, and data were also extracted at 24�6 months follow-up. Risks of systematic errors were assessed using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool, and risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated. We included 38 trials randomising 26,638 participants (mean age 61.6 years), with 23/38 trials reporting data on 26,078 participants suitable for meta-analysis. Three trials were at low risk of bias and the remaining 35 were at high risk of bias. Trials assessing macrolides (28 trials; 22,059 participants) and quinolones (two trials; 4162 participants) contributed most of the data. Meta-analyses at maximum follow-up showed that antibiotics versus placebo or no intervention seemed to increase the risk of all-cause mortality (RR 1.06; 95% CI 0.99 to 1.13), stroke (RR 1.14; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.29), and probably also cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.11; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.25). Little to no difference was observed for myocardial infarction (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.88 to 1.03) and sudden cardiac death (RR 1.08; 95% CI 0.90 to 1.31). Meta-analyses at 24�6 months follow-up showed that antibiotics increased the risk of all-cause mortality (RR 1.25; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.48), cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.50; 95% CI 1.17 to 1.91), and probably also sudden cardiac death (RR 1.77; 95% CI 1.28 to 2.44). No evidence of a difference was found for myocardial infarction or stroke at this time point. Meta-analyses of trials at low risk of bias differed only for cardiovascular mortality at maximum follow-up; all other outcomes were consistent with overall analyses. None of the trials specifically assessed serious adverse events according to ICH-GCP, and no data were available on quality of life. Current evidence suggests that antibiotics (macrolides or quinolones) for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease appear harmful when assessing all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and stroke at maximum follow-up, as well as all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and sudden cardiac death at 24�6 months follow-up. Therefore, current evidence does not support the clinical use of macrolides or quinolones for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease. Future trials examining the safety of these antibiotics for this purpose do not seem ethical, and antibiotic trials in general require longer follow-up to capture late adverse events.\n",

    "abstract = \"\"\"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation positive (M+) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is an important subtype of lung cancer comprising 10% to 15% of non-squamous tumours. This subtype is more common in women than men, is less associated with smoking, but occurs at a younger age than sporadic tumours.\n",
    "\n",
    "To assess the clinical effectiveness of single-agent or combination EGFR therapies used in the first-line treatment of people with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR M+ NSCLC compared with other cytotoxic chemotherapy (CTX) agents used alone or in combination, or best supportive care (BSC). The primary outcomes were overall survival and progression-free survival. Secondary outcomes included response rate, symptom palliation, toxicity, and health-related quality of life.\n",
    "\n",
    "We conducted electronic searches of the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2020, Issue 7), MEDLINE (1946 to 27th July 2020), Embase (1980 to 27th July 2020), and ISI Web of Science (1899 to 27th July 2020). We also searched the conference abstracts of the American Society for Clinical Oncology and the European Society for Medical Oncology (July 2020); Evidence Review Group submissions to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence; and the reference lists of retrieved articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parallel-group randomised controlled trials comparing EGFR-targeted agents (alone or in combination with cytotoxic agents or BSC) with cytotoxic chemotherapy (single or doublet) or BSC in chemotherapy-naive patients with locally advanced or metastatic (stage IIIB or IV) EGFR M+ NSCLC unsuitable for treatment with curative intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two review authors independently identified articles, extracted data, and carried out the 'Risk of bias' assessment. We conducted meta-analyses using a fixed-effect model unless there was substantial heterogeneity, in which case we also performed a random-effects analysis as a sensitivity analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Twenty-two trials met the inclusion criteria. Ten of these exclusively recruited people with EGFR M+ NSCLC; the remainder recruited a mixed population and reported results for people with EGFR M+ NSCLC as subgroup analyses. The number of participants with EGFR M+ tumours totalled 3023, of whom approximately 2563 were of Asian origin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall survival (OS) data showed inconsistent results between the included trials that compared EGFR-targeted treatments against cytotoxic chemotherapy or placebo. Erlotinib was used in eight trials, gefitinib in nine trials, afatinib in two trials, cetuximab in two trials, and icotinib in one trial. The findings of FASTACT 2 suggested a clinical benefit for OS for participants treated with erlotinib plus cytotoxic chemotherapy when compared to cytotoxic chemotherapy alone, as did the Han 2017 trial for gefitinib plus cytotoxic chemotherapy, but both results were based on a small number of participants (n = 97 and 122, respectively).\n",
    "\n",
    "For progression-free survival (PFS), a pooled analysis of four trials showed evidence of clinical benefit for erlotinib compared with cytotoxic chemotherapy (hazard ratio (HR) 0.31; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25 to 0.39; 583 participants; high-certainty evidence). A pooled analysis of two trials of gefitinib versus paclitaxel plus carboplatin showed evidence of clinical benefit for PFS for gefitinib (HR 0.39; 95% CI 0.32 to 0.48; 491 participants; high-certainty evidence), and a pooled analysis of two trials of gefitinib versus pemetrexed plus carboplatin with pemetrexed maintenance also showed evidence of clinical benefit for PFS for gefitinib (HR 0.59; 95% CI 0.46 to 0.74; 371 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Afatinib showed evidence of clinical benefit for PFS when compared with chemotherapy in a pooled analysis of two trials (HR 0.42; 95% CI 0.34 to 0.53; 709 participants; high-certainty evidence).\n",
    "\n",
    "All but one small trial showed a corresponding improvement in response rate with tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) compared to chemotherapy. Commonly reported grade 3/4 adverse events associated with afatinib, erlotinib, gefitinib and icotinib monotherapy were rash and diarrhoea. Myelosuppression was consistently worse in the chemotherapy arms; fatigue and anorexia were also associated with some chemotherapies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Seven trials reported on health-related quality of life and symptom improvement using different methodologies. For each of erlotinib, gefitinib, and afatinib, two trials showed improvement in one or more indices for the TKI compared to chemotherapy. The quality of evidence was high for the comparisons of erlotinib and gefitinib with cytotoxic chemotherapy and for the comparison of afatinib with cytotoxic chemotherapy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib and icotinib are all active agents in EGFR M+ NSCLC patients, and demonstrate an increased tumour response rate and prolonged PFS compared to cytotoxic chemotherapy. We found a beneficial effect of the TKI compared to cytotoxic chemotherapy in adverse effect and health-related quality of life. We found limited evidence for increased OS for the TKI when compared with standard chemotherapy, but the majority of the included trials allowed participants to switch treatments on disease progression, which will have a confounding effect on any OS analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Single agent-TKI remains the standard of care and the benefit of combining a TKI and chemotherapy remains uncertain as the evidence is based on small patient numbers. Cytotoxic chemotherapy is less effective in EGFR M+ NSCLC than erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib or icotinib and is associated with greater toxicity. There are no data supporting the use of monoclonal antibody therapy. Icotinib is not available outside China.\"\"\"\n"

      "EGFR mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer (EGFR M+ NSCLC) is a special type of lung cancer. It's called \"non-small cell\" because of how the cancer cells appear under a microscope, and \"EGFR mutation-positive\" because the cancer cells have changes (mutations) in the EGFR gene that allows them to grow uncontrollably. This subtype makes up about 10% to 15% of non-squamous lung tumors and is more common in women and non-smokers, though it's not fully understood why this is the case. EGFR M+ NSCLC also tends to occur at a younger age compared to other lung cancers that are not linked to smoking.\n",
      "\n",
      "This review looked at how effective different first-line treatments are for people with more advanced or spreading EGFR M+ NSCLC. They compared EGFR-targeted therapies, mainly drugs that inhibit the EGFR's action like erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib, and icotinib, against traditional chemotherapy drugs or best supportive care. The main goals were to see how these treatments affect overall survival (how long people live after treatment) and progression-free survival (how long people live without the cancer getting worse). Secondary goals included measuring the tumor's response to treatment, relief from cancer symptoms, treatment side effects, and the patients' quality of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "The review included 22 trials with around 3023 participants. Many of these participants were Asian. The researchers found that using EGFR-targeted drugs generally led to better progression-free survival compared to chemotherapy. Specifically, erlotinib, gefitinib, and afatinib showed significant benefits. In terms of overall survival, the results were less clear, partly because patients often switched treatments if their cancer progressed, which made the results harder to interpret.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding side effects, common issues with targeted therapies included rash and diarrhea. Chemotherapy, on the other hand, often caused more severe side effects like myelosuppression, fatigue, and loss of appetite. Quality of life appeared to be better with the EGFR-targeted therapies according to reported studies. However, combining these targeted therapies with chemotherapy showed benefits in specific small trials, like those with erlotinib and gefitinib, but this evidence is not strong enough to change current treatment practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, the standard treatment for EGFR M+ NSCLC usually involves using a single EGFR-targeted drug. While some compounds like icotinib show promise, it's essential to note that icotinib is mainly available in China, limiting its global use. Monoclonal antibody therapies did not show supportive data for use in EGFR M+ NSCLC.\n"
